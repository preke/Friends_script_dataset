Chandler	 So, you and Rachel tonight, huh?'
Joey	 Yeah. It's actually our first official date "
Chandler	 Wow! So tonight may be the night! You're nervous?"
Joey	 Naa, no. This is the part I'm actually good at."
Chandler	 What must it be like not to be crippled by fear\n  and self-loathing.'
Joey	 (pause) It's OK!"
Chandler	 How can you be so confident?'
Joey	 Well, I... I know exactly what I'm gonna do!"
Chandler	 Really? Like you have a routine?'
Joey	 No, no no no no. See. Each woman is different.You have\n  to appreciate their uniqueness.'
Chandler	 Really?'
Joey	 No, I do six things! First, I look deep in her eyes.\n  Then, I kiss her. Next I take my hand and I softly graze her thigh.'
Chandler	 You mean like this? (he starts touching his thigh\n  in a funny and awkard way)'
Joey	 NO! Not like that, no no. No, like this. (He starts\n  lightly grazing Chandler's thigh)"
Chandler	 Oh, I see what you mean, that's quite nice. (They\n  look at each other, both embarassed)"
Joey	 More foosball?'
Chandler	 ...and beer!!'

Monica	 (entering) Hey!'
Ross and Chandler	 Hey!'
Monica	 (to Chandler) Hey sweetie! (they\n  kiss)'
Ross	 (looking at Monica's legs) WOW!"
Chandler	 Hey! Stop staring at my wife's legs! No no! Stop\n  staring at your sister's legs!"
Ross	 I'm sorry, it's just... how did you get so tan?"
Chandler	 She went on one of those spray-on tan places.'
Ross	 Eh, you got a spray-on tan?'
Monica	 Chandler gets pedicures!'
Ross	 (laughing) Why, why you do, like with the-the toe separators?'
Chandler	 (To Monica) Why...why?'
Ross	 Still, I can't believe that's sprayed on... I mean,\n  it looks really good. I wonder if I should get one!"
Chandler	 Sure, then you should get a mini skirt so you can\n  really show it off.'
Ross	 So, do you get colours or just French tips?'
Monica	 There. Here's their card."
Ross	 Thanks. (he takes the card) Hey, I know where this\n  place is! It used to be an X-rated video... (pauses when he realizes what he\n  is saying) florist. (he goes away)'
Phoebe	 Hey!'
Chandler	 Hey Pheebs!'
Monica	 Hey Phoebe!'
Phoebe	 Oh, you won't believe who moved back to town."
Monica	 I know, Amanda! Ah! She called me\n  too! She's the worst!"
Chandler	 Who's Amanda?"
Monica	 She\'s this girl who used to live\n  in the building before you did. Then she moved to England and she picked up\n  this fake British accent. On the machine this is her message. (she apes Amanda\n  using an awful British accent) "Monica, darling! It\'s Amanda calling!"'
Chandler	 Are you trying to do a British accent?'
Monica	 (pause) (to Phoebe) Chandler gets\n  pedicures!'
Chandler	 Just so I know, how many more of those can I expect?'
Phoebe	 You know what Amanda said to me when she got me on\n  the phone? (apes Amanda in a british accent) "Oh, so sorry to catch you\n  on your Mo-Bile!" If-if you don\'t wanna get me on my mo-Bile, don\'t call\n  me on my mo-Bile!"'
Monica	 I know, and she's always bragging\n  about all the famous people she's met."
Phoebe	 Oh, I know! "Oh...I slept with Billy Joel".\n  All right, who hasn\'t?'
Monica	 Oh, what are we gonna do! I don't\n  wanna see her!!"
Phoebe	 Ugh, Let's just cut her out!"
Monica	 What?'
Phoebe	 Cut her out of our lives! Just ignore her calls and\n  dodge her 'till she gets the point!"
Monica	 Oh, I guess we could try that, but...\n  it seems so harsh! (to Chandler) Have you ever done that?'
Chandler	 No, had it done to me though. Feels good !\n'
Ross	 Well... I like how you look, what are you?'
Assistant	 Puerto Rican.'
Ross	 Two, I think a two.'
Assistant	 You've got to face the red light.\n  When the red light goes on the spraying is about to start so close your eyes.\n  When the spraying stops, count to five. Pat yourself down to avoid drip marks\n  then turn around so we can get your back. Got it?"
Ross	 Spray, count, pat, then turn, spray, count and pat.'
Assistant	 Wow, you catch on quick.'
Ross	 Well, I have a PhD, so... (assistant walk out, not\n  impressed by this statement)\n  (Ross takes his bathrobe off and he enters the tanning booth. He stands up\n  in front of the red light and the sprayer starts and sprays his face and torso)'
Ross	 One Mississipi, two Mississipi, Three Mis...(the sprayer\n  starts again, spraying him in the face and torso again) WAIT! WAIT! I'm not-I've\n  not finished counting!! (he leaves the booth) (the assistant enters the room)"
Ross	 You sprayed my front twice!'
Assistant	 You've never turned?\n"
Ross	 No, I barely even\n  got to three Mississippi. '
Assistant	 Mississippi? I said count to\n  five'!"
Ross	 Mississippilesly? (pause) Well, how\n  bad is it?'
Assistant	 Ain't that bad yet, but it keeps\n  getting darker for the next four hours."
Ross	 So, how dark is it\n  gonna get?'
Assistant	 You got sprayed with two two'\n  s and..."
Ross	 I'm a four?"
Assistant	 Yeah, but you're back's a zero.\n  You're gonna wanna even that out."
Ross	 (sarcastically) Really!'
Assistant	 You might wanna get back in there.'
Ross	 (annoyed) Ok!'
Ross	 Wait, wait a minute, there's no light\n  on the back wall! How do I know when it's gonna start? Hello? (he slowly turns\n  and the spraying begins, on his face) Ah, oh, ah! (he turns, but then he turns\n  again and is sprayed in the front again) Ah! (he spits and angrily goes out\n  of the spray-on tan booth and the assistant enters the room) The same thing\n  happened again!"
Assistant	 You got two more twos?'
Ross	 (hysterically) I'm an eight!"
Joey	 I thought you paid. (Rachel does not answer and seems\n  puzzled) Ha, guess we won\xe2\x80\x99t be going back there!'
Rachel	 So.'
Joey	 Yeah.'
Joey	 Hey what do you say, we move this onto the likes of\n  the couch?'
Rachel	 I say \xe2\x80\x98cheesy line\xe2\x80\x99, but ok.'
Joey	 What\xe2\x80\x99s the matter?'
Rachel	 I am sorry, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, I am sorry, I don\xe2\x80\x99t\n  know why I did that!'
Joey and Rachel	 Okay'
Rachel	 Ok, so sorry.'
Rachel	 I am sorry! Again... I don't know, I don\xe2\x80\x99t\n  know what happened, I must be nervous!"
Joey	 I don\xe2\x80\x99t get it, Chandler loved it!'
Rachel	 Ok, ok, ok. I promise, I promise, I promise, I won\xe2\x80\x99t\n  do it again. I really do. I promise. This is gonna be great.'
Joey	 Ok.'
Joey	 (a little giddy) Uh, was that good for you?\n'
Phoebe	 Oh, yeah. Could be Rachel asking if someone could\n  baby-sit again.'
Monica	 It could be Amanda!'
Phoebe	 Oh, you\xe2\x80\x99re right! I was just kidding about\n  Rachel. Babysitting is a gas!'
Amanda	 Hello Monica. It\xe2\x80\x99s Amanda calling again. I\n  am in the neighborhood hoping I can pop by your flat!'
Monica	 You're from Yonkers! Your last name\n  is Buffo-Martisis!"
Amanda	 Let\xe2\x80\x99s see.. to assure you get this directly,\n  ring me back on my mobile.'
Phoebe	 Ok, don\xe2\x80\x99t hold thy breath!'
Chandler	 Hello? Is someone on the line?'
Amanda	 Yes, I was looking for Monica.'
Chandler	 Hang on, she\xe2\x80\x99s right here. (he enters the\n  living room and hands the phone to Monica) Someone's on the phone, for ya."
Monica	 We weren\xe2\x80\x99t picking up, it\xe2\x80\x99s\n  Amanda!'
Chandler	 (to Amanda) I get pedicures!'
Monica	 Hi Amanda! Actually now... it\xe2\x80\x99s...\n  is not a good time. Dinner tomorrow night? (Phoebe mouths 'no') Ok, Phoebe\n  and I will see you then!"
Phoebe	 Why, why, why didn\xe2\x80\x99t you just say no!'
Monica	 Well, I said 'no' to her coming\n  over now! I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t say 'no' twice! I get this uncontrollable need to\n  please people!"
Phoebe	 (leaving) Fine, fine! You would not hold up well\n  under torture!'
Monica	 And you would?'
Phoebe	 I did!\n'
Rachel	 Absolutely! Absolutely. I d... it\xe2\x80\x99s just a\n  little weird, it\xe2\x80\x99s you, and it\xe2\x80\x99s me, it's just gonna take some\n  getting used to."
Joey	 Ok. Well, how, how can we make it easier?'
Rachel	 Ok, let\xe2\x80\x99s work from the top down! (Joey nods,\n  but then puzzled because he does not get it) Just work the bra, Joe!'
Joey	 Ok, yeah, got it.'
Rachel and Joey	 Okay.'
Joey	 This thing welded shut?!'
Rachel	 Okay.'
Joey	 All right, turn around, I got to get a look at this\n  thing.'
Rachel	 Oh!'
Rachel	 Ow!'
Joey	 Sorry!'
Rachel	 Well this is romantic!'
Joey	 I'm sorry! (He stands up) This never happened to me\n  before! I'm an expert at taking off bras! I can do it with one hand! I can\n  do it with my eyes closed! One time I just looked at one, and it popped open!\n  I blame your bra!"
Rachel	 It\xe2\x80\x99s a standard issue bra clasp!'
Joey	 Then I blame you! Yeah! That's right! You threw me\n  off with all your slapping!"
Rachel	 Ok well, well I'm really, I'm sorry about that Joey,\n  but do you think that maybe on some level, you don't want to take\n  off my bra?"
Joey	 (contemplates for a few moments what Rachel just said)\n  NAH! I don't have another level!! \n"
\nChandler	 Hold on! There is something different.'
Ross	 I went to that tanning place your wife suggested.'
Chandler	 Was that place... The Sun?'
Ross	 Oh! And it gets worse! (Turns his side to Chandler\n  and Monica and pulls up his shirt. There's a distinct line across his body,\n  where his belly is very tanned and his back is very pale.)"
Chandler	 Oh My God! You can do a duet of Ebony and Ivory\n  all by yourself!'
Monica	 How could you mess this up? It's\n  so easy? You go into the booth, you count to five and you turn around!!"
Ross	 (looks at her suspiciously) How do you count to five?'
Monica	 One Two Three...'
Ross	 (Yells) Damnit! (Goes to the door to leave. Rachel\n  just enters, sees him and starts laughing)'
Rachel	 (laughing) oooh! Oh oh!'
Ross	 (Still yelling) I Know!'
Rachel	 oh oh! What is up with Miss Hawaiian Tropic?'
Chandler	 How was your date with Joey?'
Rachel	 Well, it was good.. until we got back to our apartment,\n  and then we were fooling around and he started to put his hand up my leg and\n  I kept slapping it away!'
Chandler	 You didn't like that?"
Rachel	 Well, it wasn't just me, alright? He freaked out\n  too! He couldn't even undo my bra!"
Monica	 Wow, really? One time he just looked\n  at my bra and it popped open.'
Rachel	 I do not know what's wrong with us, I mean, we have\n  kissed before and that's been great! But this time it was leading somewhere\n  and I was very aware of the fact that it was Joey touching me."
Monica	 Well, you guys have been friends\n  forever. Remember the first time that you kissed Ross? How weird that was?\n  You couldn't stop laughing? You got through that."
Rachel	 (looking thoughtful) Ok, that's true. That's true,\n  we can do this. You're right, you're right, we can do this. We're just gonna\n  power through!"
Joey	 Hey Chandler can I talk to you for a second (points\n  to the hall).'
Rachel	 (To Joey) No need!! Problem solved, we are powering through\n  (At which point she grabs his hand and pulls him back to their apartment).'
Monica	 (sees what he is doing) Chandler,\n  stop! It is not going to pop open!'
Chandler	 (without taking his eyes off the bra) You don't\n  know! (Monica just smiles)\n"
Monica	 Hey Phoebe!'
Phoebe	 Hey!'
Monica	 Is Amanda here yet?'
Phoebe	 No.'
Monica	 (sits down) Oh good. Good, look\n  I'm so sorry, for screwing up that cutting-her-out plan. But I have a new plan.\n  Chandler agreed to call here in a few minutes with an emergency."
Phoebe	 Oh! Well, what kind of emergency that gets us both\n  out of here?'
Monica	 Well, what do you think of Mike\n  and Chandler being in a car accident?'
Phoebe	 (makes a face) Are you kidding, I love it!'
Phoebe	 Hi!'
Monica	 Hi!'
Amanda	 Hi! (Phoebe and Amanda hug)'
Amanda	 (To Monica) Hello!'
Amanda	 (In a fake British accent) It's so nice to see you!\n  Both of you! Look at me. Look how young I look! (gives her coat to Monica as\n  well) Oh gosh! We have so much to catch up on! But first things first
Monica	 (beaming) Yeah! Yeah! His name is\n  Chandler and...'
Amanda	 (To Phoebe) Smell my neck! (Phoebe does so) It's\n  not perfume! It's me! It's my natural scent!"
Phoebe	 Musty!'
Amanda	 Oh! Gosh! This is brilliant. Gosh, it's just like\n  old times. I'm so happy you two are friends again!"
Monica	 When were we not friends?'
Amanda	 Well, it was 1992, and I remember because that was\n  the year I had sex with Evil Knievel (She starts laughing very proudly).'
Monica	 Ehm, we were friends in 1992.'
Amanda	 (to Phoebe) No I distinctly remember you were dodging\n  her (points at Monica) calls and trying to avoid seeing her. '
Monica	 (To Phoebe) You were going to cut\n  me out?'
Phoebe	 Well...kinda.'
Monica	 Oh My God!'
Amanda	 Oh! Bugger. Should I not have said that? I feel like\n  a perfect arse!'
Phoebe	 Yeah well, in America you\'re just an "ass".'
Monica	 (Into the phone) Hello? Chandler,\n  what's wrong? (She listens) Oh my God, are you alright? (listens some more)\n  Yeah, I'll be right there. (She hangs up and speaks to Amanda) I'm so sorry,\n  but Chandler was in a car accident. (She gets up)"
Phoebe	 (Also gets up and starts taking her purse) Oh my\n  God. Was Mike with him?'
Monica	 Nope! (She turns and leaves)\n'
Joey	 (To Rachel) Hey!'
Rachel	 Hey! Got champagne?'
Joey	 Yes ma'am, ready to Power through!"
Rachel	 Excellent! Stick it in the ice bucket, the phone\n  is off the hook, and in the interest of powering through (Starts to remove\n  her bra from under her clothes)...'
Joey	 Uh! (When she's done she throws her bra at him) "
Rachel	 Ok (starts to light some candles) Sexy, sexy, very\n  sexy, sexy. (Claps her hands and jumps at Joey, clearly very excited) Alright!\n  Lets do it!'
Joey	 Ok, you're scaring me a little bit."
Rachel	 Oh! Get over it soldier, we've gotta do this! (She\n  pulls him towards her and throws him onto the barcalounger) Ok. Aha! You like\n  that huh?"
Joey	 Oh! yeah!'
Rachel	 You like that? (She climbs on the barcalounger seductively,\n  putting her knees next to Joey's hips.) Let's take this into high gear (She\n  pulls the barcalounger lever and seat reclines. She puts one of her knees between\n  his legs and begins to kiss his neck.)"
Joey	 uh uh!'
Rachel	 Yeah baby, I'll show you how we do it!"
Joey	 No, no, no! You kneed me in my misters!'
Rachel	 What? Oh my God! I'm so sorry. Joey? Are you ok?"
Joey	 (He just sits there, legs very close together with\n  a painful look on his face) Soldier down!\n'
Monica	 We are not friends with Phoebe anymore.'
Chandler	 If she asks, I protested a little, but ok!'
Phoebe	 Oh Chandler! Thank God you're alive. Monica, can\n  I talk to you outside for a minute?"
Monica	 I have nothing to say to\n  you.'
Amanda	 (announces more to herself than anyone else) Wow,\n  my flat is twice this size!'
Phoebe	 Please, Monica? In the hall?'
Amanda	 Ooh, that accident must have been terrible. You look\n  positively ghastly.'
Chandler	 Well, aren't you a treat."
Monica	 I can't believe you tried to cut\n  me out. Why Phoebe, why?"
Phoebe	 It was right after we were living together and you\n  were driving me crazy, okay? You were really controlling and compulsive and\n  shrill.'
Monica	 I'm still all those things!"
Phoebe	 You're also so generous and kind and scrappy!"
Monica	 (starts smiling) I am scrappy.'
Phoebe	 Exactly! Look, no matter what I tried to do, I couldn't\n  keep you out of my life. Of all the people I have cut out, you were the only\n  one who ever clawed her way back in."
Monica	 It's because I'm scrappy."
Phoebe	 Yeah, you are. And I'm so glad that you fought your\n  way back in, because I don't know what I would do without you."
Monica	 I won't know what I would do without\n  you."
Monica	 Well, I guess we should go back\n  in. When you gave me another chance, I guess we should do the same for Amanda.'
Phoebe	 Yeah, I guess you're right."
Amanda	 Can you believe it. I've never had any professional\n  dance training."
Glenda	 Now, let me explain how this works. You go into the\n  booth, and...'
Ross	 I'm gonna stop you right there, Glenda. Okay? Does\n  it look like this is my first time, huh? Now I want 4 two's... and I want them\n  all on my back."
Glenda	 (quietly) Okay...'
Ross	 Wait a minute, there's two sets of nozzles, which one\n  is it?"
Ross	 Which... which... which... Which one is it?'
Ross	 OH! SON OF A BITCH!'
Rachel	 What is the matter with us?'
Joey	 Well, I know what's the matter with me."
Rachel	 No, I mean with us, you know. I mean, is it supposed\n  to be this... difficult?'
Joey	 I don't know."
Chandler	 That fake British woman is a real bitch, but she\n  sure can dance... Hey!'
Rachel	 Hi! Hey, listen, can we ask you a question? When\n  you and Monica first hooked up, was it weird going from friends to... more\n  than that?'
Chandler	 Kinda... you know, sneaking around, having to hide\n  from you guys...'
Rachel	 No, no, no... No, I mean... se-x-u-ally...'
Joey	 Yeah, was there a part of you that... felt like it\n  was... really wrong?'
Chandler	 Actually, no. No, it felt right. You know, it felt\n  like uhm... I can't believe we haven't been doing this the whole time."
Chandler	 I can tell from your expressions that that's the\n  good news you were hoping for... Well, I'm gonna go continue to... spread the\n  joy.(Chandler leaves the apartment. Joey sighs)"
Rachel	 Well, just because it happened that way for them\n  doesn't mean it has to happen that way for us."
Joey	 Yeah, yeah... Absolutely. I mean, just because something's\n  difficult doesn't mean that you quit."
Rachel	 Right, totally.'
Joey	 Yeah, so we just keep trying and trying until we...\n  do it.'
Rachel	 Yeah, and if doesn't work, then we'll be just one\n  of those couples that never have sex."
Joey	 That's a... pla-an."
Joey	 (sighs) Wow... I did not see this coming.'
Rachel	 I know.\n\nJoey
Rachel	 Hmmm... Me too...'
Rachel	 I wonder how Monica and Chandler could do it?'
Joey	 I guess they weren't as good friends as we are."
Rachel	 Aah... I bet you're right."
Joey	 So...'
Rachel	 Yeah.'
Joey	 I love ya.'
Rachel	 Love you too... Alright, I'm going to bed."
Joey	 Yeah, me too.'
Joey	 Ooh, yeah, I'm not going anywhere for a while."
Chandler	 Dude, it's Chandler. Let me in."
Ross	 Go away! I don't want to see anybody."
Chandler	 I know, I went to the tanning place and the same\n  thing happened to me. You have to let me in.'
Ross	 Really? Did you count Mississipily?'
Ross	 Dude, you're not tanned."
Chandler	 No, I just had to get a picture of this.'
Chandler	 I see you later!'
