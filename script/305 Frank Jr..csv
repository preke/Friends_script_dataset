Chandler	 Ah, Kim Basinger, Cindy Crawford, Halle Berry, Yasmine Bleeth, and ah,\nJessica Rabbit.'
Rachel	 Now, you do realize that she\xc2\x92s a cartoon, and way out of your\nleague?'

Joey	 Hey, Monica, who would yours be?'
Monica	 First, I need a boyfriend, then I can have a list.'
Joey	 It\xc2\x92s just a game Mon. (makes a \xc2\x91Can-you-believe-her\xc2\x92 face\nto the rest of the gang.) Rach, how about you?'

Rachel	 Well, so, now, do you guys have a lot of big plans?'
Phoebe	 Oh yeah! Yeah, no, we\xc2\x92re gonna connect, y'know bond, and\neverything."
Frank	 Yeah, I was thinking that maybe we could go down to Time Square and pick\nup some ninja stars. And, oh, um, my friend Larry, he wants me to take a picture of a\nhooker.'
Chandler	 You know, we don\xc2\x92t really take advantage of living in the city.'
Joey	 I know.'
Joey	 Oh, I\xc2\x92m sorry. Did I get \xc2\x91ya?'
Chandler	 No, you didn\xc2\x92t get me!! It\xc2\x92s an electric drill, you get\nme, you kill me!!'
Joey	 Calm down, do you want this unit or not?'
Chandler	 I do NOT want this unit!!'
Joey	 Well, you should\xc2\x92ve told me that before, I\xc2\x92m not a mind reader.\nHey, we\xc2\x92re out of beer. I\xc2\x92m going to Monica\xc2\x92s.'
Chandler	 Fine! (goes into his room and slams the door, then he slams the bottom\nhalf of the door.)'
Monica	 Hey! Where \xc2\x91ya headin\xc2\x92 in those pants? 1982?'
Joey	 Oh Monica, listen, I ah, I saw down at the hardware store, they got those\ndesigner tiles on sale. If you ever want to redo the bathroom floor.'
Monica	 Why, what\xc2\x92s wrong with my bathroom floor?'
Joey	 Nothing. It\xc2\x92s just old and dingy, that\xc2\x92s all.'
Monica	 I highly doubt that. (they both go to the bathroom)'
Joey	 Oh yeah. If you ah, move your hamper, you see what color the tile used to\nbe. (Monica gasps) Yeah.'
Monica	 I can\xc2\x92t live like this! What are we gonna do? What are we gonna do?'
Joey	 Relax. Here hold this (hands her his beer). This old stuff just comes\nright off. (he bends down to try and lift some tile right in the middle of the floor, in\nhis tight pants.)'
Monica	 That\xc2\x92s a little more than I wanted to see.'
Joey	 (manages to pry off only a small piece) Aw! Look at that, every inch of\nthis stuff is glued down. It\xc2\x92d take forever to pry this up. You should ah, you should\njust leave it. (starts to walk away, but Monica grabs him)'
Monica	 I can\xc2\x92t leave it! You gouged a hole in my dingy floor.'
Joey	 Eh! There you go.'
Monica	 You know that\xc2\x92s nice, y'know we could put it back there after the\nsurgeons remove it from your colon!"
Phoebe	 (sits up) Oh, ew!'
Frank	 What?'
Phoebe	 Yeah I know what I wanted to ask you. Um, can you roll your tongue?\nBecause I can, and my Mom couldn\xc2\x92t, and I thought y'know, I figured that was\nsomething I got from our Dad."
Frank	 What, wait, you mean like this? (does it)'
Phoebe	 Yeah, yeah. You can do it to. (tries to do it, but can\xc2\x92t)'
Frank	 Your not doing it.'
Phoebe	 Oh right, yeah okay, my Mom could, and I can\xc2\x92t. We don\xc2\x92t have\nthat....'
Frank	 When\xc2\x92s your birthday?'

Phoebe	 Wow, that\xc2\x92s close. When\xc2\x92s yours?'
Frank	 October 25th.'
Phoebe	 That\xc2\x92s the same month as Halloween. So, um, what kinda\nthings do you like to do at home?'
Frank	 Melt stuff.'
Ross	 Okay, I\xc2\x92ve got three of my five.'
Rachel	 Three of your five, what?'
Ross	 Celebrities I\xc2\x92m allowed to sleep with.'
Rachel	 Oh my God! You are giving this a lot of thought.'
Ross	 Yeah, it\xc2\x92s hard okay, I only have two spots left.'

Ross	 Okay, Elizabeth Hurely....'
Chandler	 Oooh-hoo, very attractive, forgiving.'
Ross	 Susan Sarandon.'
Chandler	 Eh, y'know what, she\xc2\x92s to political, she probably wouldn\xc2\x92t\nlet you do it, unless you donated four cans of food first."
Ross	 And!! Isabella Rosselini.'
Chandler	 Ooh-hoo. Very hot, very sexy. But ah, y'know she\xc2\x92s too\ninternational, y'know she\xc2\x92s never gonna be around."
Rachel	 So?'
Chandler	 So, you gotta play the odds, pick somebody who\xc2\x92s gonna be in the\ncountry like all the time.'
Rachel	 Yeah, \xc2\x91cause that\xc2\x92s why you won\xc2\x92t get Isabella Rosselini,\ngeography.'
Phoebe	 Okay so, by melting, you meant melting.'
Frank	 Yeah.'
Phoebe	 So is it like art?'
Frank	 Yeah, you can melt art. Hey, can I use your phone?'
Phoebe	 Um, yeah sure. Why you wanna call your Mom?'
Frank	 No, I wanna melt it.'
Phoebe	 Oh, well um, not right now. Y'know I\xc2\x92m just gonna go to bed, I\nthink the fumes are giving me a headache."
Frank	 (starts laughing) Yeah!'
Phoebe	 G\xc2\x92night, bro.'
Frank	 G\xc2\x92night.'

Frank	 Oh, excellent. (starts to melt the fire extinguisher\xc2\x92s hose.)'

Monica	 What kind of karate is that?'
Phoebe	 No kind. He just makes it up.'
Monica	 So how\xc2\x92s it going with you guys?'
Phoebe	 So far, it kinda blows. I don\xc2\x92t know, I just thought y'know that\nhe\xc2\x92d feel more like a brother y'know, like you and Ross, just like close and\nconnected and...."
Monica	 Oh honey, we\xc2\x92re close now but you-you wouldn\xc2\x92t believe the\nyears of-of nugies, and wedgies, and flying wedgies, and atomic wedgies, and....(Phoebe\nshakes her head like she doesn\xc2\x92t understand) That\xc2\x92s where the waistband actually\ngoes over your head. '
Phoebe	 Ah!!'
Monica	 Oh, we used to drive each other crazy playing the shadow game.'
Phoebe	 Oh, how do you play the shadow game?'
Monica	 Oh, how do you play the shadow game?'
Phoebe	 I just asked you.'
Monica	 I just asked you.'
Phoebe	 I don\xc2\x92t have time for this.'
Monica	 No, that is what the game is.'
Phoebe	 Which you just gave up really quickly.'
Chandler	 (entering) Have you seen Joey?'
Monica	 What\xc2\x92s the matter?'
Chandler	 Oh, just this! (turns around and has a paint lid stuck to the back of\nhis pants.) Y\xc2\x92know what it\xc2\x92s my fault really, because the couch is usually where\nwe keep the varnish.'
Joey	 (yelling from bathroom) Hey, does somebody wanna hand me one of those\ntiles.'
Chandler	 What\xc2\x92s going on?'
Monica	 He\xc2\x92s retiling my floor. (they both run to the bathroom)'

Monica	 Ah-ah-ah, now you started this, you will finish it.'
Chandler	 He started mine first!'

Phoebe	 No, no, no, I wouldn\xc2\x92t do you myself, I mean that would be weird.\nYeah, no, I\xc2\x92ll get one of the other girls to do it. Oh, this will be so much fun!\nHey! Are you excited?'
Frank	 Yeah! Hey, do Monica and Rachel work there?'

Girl	 That\xc2\x92s my job!'
Frank	 So wait, what\xc2\x92s the deal here, I can have sex with you, but I\ncan\xc2\x92t touch you?'
Phoebe and Girl	 Ewww!!!'
Phoebe	 You can\xc2\x92t have sex with her!'
Girl	 What\xc2\x92d you think I was, a hooker?'
Frank	 No, your a masseuse, it\xc2\x92s cool, I\xc2\x92m not a cop.'
Phoebe	 Okay, Jasmine, can you, can you ask Mr. Whiffler if he can wait for like\nfive minutes.'
Jasmine	 Fine. (starts to leave, and points at Frank) I don\xc2\x92t like you!!\n(leaves)'
Phoebe	 (turns around and hits Frank) So that\xc2\x92s what you thought I did!!\nGod! That\xc2\x92s not what I do!'
Frank	 Wait that\xc2\x92s-that\xc2\x92s, what that\xc2\x92s not what you do?'
Phoebe	 Nooo! Why would you think that?'
Frank	 I don\xc2\x92t know, I mean, y'know, this is the city y'know, I just, I\nmean, I don\xc2\x92t know."
Phoebe	 Whatever, it\xc2\x92s the perfect end to the perfect weekend anyways.'
Frank	 Oh, wait, no your right, no it was perfect and I can\xc2\x92t believe that\nI screwed it up so bad.'
Phoebe	 You really thought it was perfect?'
Frank	 Well, no, maybe-maybe it wasn\xc2\x92t perfect, but y'know it was pretty\ncool, y'know, \xc2\x91cause we had all those great talks y'know."
Phoebe	 Yeah, um, which ones in particular were great for you?'
Frank	 Well y'know about the tongue thing, y'know, and how I told you about my\nlikes and my dislikes..."
Phoebe	 I don\xc2\x92t....'
Frank	 How-how I like to melt stuff, and how I dislike stuff that doesn\xc2\x92t\nmelt.'

Phoebe	 She wasn\xc2\x92t a hooker.'
Frank	 Well, when I tell my friends about her she will be. '
Chandler	 Okay, on three. One....Two....'
Joey	 Why don\xc2\x92t we just go on two.'
Chandler	 Why two?'
Joey	 Because it\xc2\x92s faster.'
Chandler	 Yeah, I coulda counted to three like four times without all this\n\xc2\x91two\xc2\x92 talk.'
Rachel	 Oh!'
Joey	 All right, but in the future...'
Ross	 Okay!! Okay!!'
Rachel	 Come on!'
Ross	 Heavy thing, not getting lighter!'
Chandler	 Okay, one...two...'
Joey	 So we are going on two?'
All	 All right!! (they lift it into place, however there is one small problem,\nthe unit is so long that it blocks some of both of their bedroom doors.)'
Chandler	 Oh, good job Joe.'
Joey	 Wow, it\xc2\x92s big!'
Chandler	 Yeah-yeah, so big that it actually makes our doors look smaller! '
Joey	 Maybe, my ruler\xc2\x92s wrong.'
Phoebe	 Maybe all the rulers are wrong.'
Joey	 Look it\xc2\x92s not that bad. So what, it blocks a little of your door, a\nlittle of my door.'
Chandler	 Yeah, y'know what I got a better idea. How-how \xc2\x91bout it blocks\nnone of mine door and a lot of yours? (throws his shoulder into the center to try and move\nit, but it doesn\xc2\x92t move.)"
Joey	 Yeah, listen, before I forget that side is still wet.'
Rachel	 Okay sir, um-mm, let see if I got this right. Ah, so this is a half-caf,\ndouble tall, easy hazel nut, non-fat, no foam, with whip, extra hot latte, right? (the guy\nnods) Okay, great. (she starts to walk away and under her breath) You freak.'
Ross	 (to Gunther) Thank you.'
Isabella	 (to Gunther) Um, coffee to go, please.'
Ross	 Isabella Rosselini. (points to her)'
Monica	 Are you serious? (they all look) Oh my God.'
Ross	 Damn! I can\xc2\x92t believe I took her off my list.'
Monica	 Why? \xc2\x91Cause otherwise you\xc2\x92d go for it?'
Ross	 Yeah, maybe.'
Rachel	 Oh-oh, you lie.'
Ross	 What you don\xc2\x92t think I\xc2\x92d go up to her?'
Rachel	 Ross, it took you ten years to finally admit you liked me.'
Ross	 Yeah, well missy, you better be glad that list is laminated.'
Rachel	 You know what honey, you go ahead, we\xc2\x92ll call her an alternate.'
Ross	 Okay, hold my crawler.'
Rachel	 Okay.'
Monica	 Rach, are you really gonna let him do this?'
Rachel	 Honey, he\xc2\x92s about to go hit on Isabella Rosselini. I\xc2\x92m just\nsorry we don\xc2\x92t got popcorn.'
Ross	 (to Isabella) Hi! Hi, I\xc2\x92m Ross, you don\xc2\x92t know me, but I\xc2\x92m\na big, big fan of yours. I mean, Blue Velvet, woo-oo hoo! Um, I was wondering if I\ncould um, maybe buy you a cup of coffee? (Gunther hands her change) Or maybe reimburse you\nfor that one? '
Isabella	 Aren\xc2\x92t you with that girl over there? (points at Rachel, who\nwaves back)'
Ross	 Well, yeah, kinda. Um, but that\xc2\x92s okay, see we have an understanding,\num, see we each have this list of five famous people, (gets his out) so I\xc2\x92m allowed\nto sleep with you. No, no, no, it\xc2\x92s flattery.'
Isabella	 I\xc2\x92m sorry. (starts to leave)'
Ross	 Oh no, no, no, wait, wait, Isabella. Don\xc2\x92t, don\xc2\x92t just dismiss\nthis so fast. I mean this is a once in a lifetime opportunity...'
Isabella	 Yeah, for you. Is that the list?'
Ross	 Um, yeah.'
Isabella	 May I see it?'
Ross	 Um, no.'
Isabella	 Come on! (grabs the list)'
Ross	 But, okay.'
Isabella	 (reading it) I\xc2\x92m not on the list!'
Ross	 Um, see, but that\xc2\x92s not the final draft.'
Isabella	 It\xc2\x92s laminated!'
Ross	 Yeah, um, okay see, you were, you were on the list but my friend, Chandler\n(Chandler waves) brought up the very good point that you are international, so I bumped\nyou for Wynona Rider, local.'
Isabella	 Y'know it\xc2\x92s ironic..."
Ross	 What?'
Isabella	 ...because I have a list of five goofy coffee house guys and yesterday\nI bumped you for that guy over there. (points at a guy and leaves)'
Ross	 (to the rest of the gang) We\xc2\x92re just gonna be friends.'

Joey	 Y'know what?"
Chandler	 Umm?'
Joey	 I bet \xc2\x91ya ya I could fit in there. (points to a hole in the center)'
Chandler	 I\xc2\x92ve got five bucks says you can\xc2\x92t.'
Joey	 Get out your checkbook, mister.'
Chandler	 Oh, I think I have the cash.'
Joey	 You are dogged man! I totally fit!'
Chandler	 Yeah, you got me. (picks up a 2x4 and puts it through the handles so\nthat the doors won\xc2\x92t open) I\xc2\x92m out five big ones! (puts the money in the crack\nbetween the door and frame) Here you go.'
Joey	 Thank you. Cha-ching! (Chandler starts to leave) Oh, well hello Mr.\nLincoln. Better luck next time buddy. (Chandler leaves and closes the door) And the drinks\nare on me!'
