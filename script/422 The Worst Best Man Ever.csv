The Stripper	 Yeah?'
Joey	 Yeah. I\xc2\x92ll let you play with my duck.'
Joey	 Hey, (realises he doesn\xc2\x92t know her name.) stripper! (He notices that\nthe ring box is open, so he picks it up, sees it\xc2\x92s empty and starts to panic.)'

Chandler	 (opening the door) What?'
Joey	 The ring is gone!'
Chandler	 Ugh. Just a sec, give me a minute to wake up for this\xc2\x97Ah-ha-ha!!\nYou lost the ring! You\xc2\x92re the worst best man ever!'

Chandler	 You slept with the stripper?'
Joey	 Of course!! (Shrugs.)'
Phoebe	 Hi, guys.'
Rachel	 Hi! Phoebe. (Both Monica and her try to move out of Phoebe\xc2\x92s way.)'
Monica	 Hi Phoebe.'
Phoebe	 I-I wanted to apologise if I\xc2\x97y\xc2\x92know seemed a tad edgy\nyesterday at my shower. Y\xc2\x92know it\xc2\x92s just the hormones, y\xc2\x92know.'
Rachel	 No we\xc2\x85'
Monica	 Hormones.'
Rachel	 \xc2\x85hormones, yeah.'
Phoebe	 Anyway, I just wanted to say thank you, it was just, it was so sweet.\n(She goes to hug them and they both flinch, thinking that Phoebe is about to attack them.)'
Monica	 Wow, you seem to be doing so much better. That\xc2\x92s great. So how-how\nare things going?'
Phoebe	 Good. Y\xc2\x92know\xc2\x97no-no, okay, it\xc2\x92s-it feels like\neverything\xc2\x92s been about me lately, so what\xc2\x92s happening with you?'
Rachel	 Oh, well, actually we were just talking about me not going to\nRoss\xc2\x92s wedding.'
Phoebe	 Oh!'
Rachel	 It just might be too hard, given the history and all that\xc2\x85'
Phoebe	 Wow! This reminds me of the time when I was umm, living on the street\nand this guy offered to buy me food if I slept with him.'
Rachel	 Well, h-how is this like that?'
Phoebe	 Well, let\xc2\x92s see, it\xc2\x92s not. Really, like that. Because, you see\nthat was an actual problem, and uh, yours is just like y\xc2\x92know a bunch of\ny\xc2\x92know high school crap that nobody really gives y\xc2\x92know\xc2\x85'
Rachel	 (starting to cry) I\xc2\x92m-I\xc2\x92m sorry, I just thought that\xc2\x85'
Phoebe	 Alrighty, here come the water works. (Rachel starts crying harder.)'
Joey	 Ugh! I don\xc2\x92t know what I\xc2\x92m going to do! I called the company\nthat sent and th-they don\xc2\x92t care! Then I called 9-1-1 and they laughed at me, if this\nisn\xc2\x92t an emergency, then what is?'
Ross	 (entering) Hey guys!'
Chandler	 Hey!'
Joey	 Hey\xc2\x85'
Ross	 I just wanted to thank you again for last night, what a great party! And\nthe guys from work had a blast. Y\xc2\x92know, one of them had never been to a bachelor\nparty before. Yeah! And-and another one had never been to a party before, so\xc2\x85'
Joey	 So uh, hey, that uh, that wedding ring, huh? Man, that\xc2\x92s nice!'
Ross	 Yeah, right!'
Joey	 I was uh, I was thinking I might want to pick one of those babies up for\nmyself, I might want to get one of those\xc2\x85'
Ross	 That ring? When my grandmother first came to this country, that ring and\nthe clothes on her back were all she had with her.'
Chandler	 So you might say, the ring is irreplaceable? (Gives Joey a little\nsqueeze.)'
Ross	 Oh absolutely! It has been in my family for generations, and every bride\nwho has worn it has had a long and happy life.'
Chandler	 So you might say, it\xc2\x92s a magic ring.'
Joey	 (laughs, softly) Yeah, the stripper stole it.'
Ross	 My-my ring? My-my wedding ring? The-the stripper stole my wedding ring?!\nH-how?! How could this all happen?!'
Chandler	 Well, I think it all started when you said, "Hey Joey, why\ndon\xc2\x92t you be my best man."'
Ross	 (dialling the phone) All right-all right, fine! I-I\xc2\x92m gonna call the\ncops!'
Joey	 Dude, I screwed up, you don\xc2\x92t have to turn me in!'
Ross	 Not on you! On the stripper!'
Joey	 Oh, yeah, well I already did that! They said they\xc2\x92re gonna look into\nit right after they solved all the murders.'
Ross	 Okay, well, we\xc2\x92ll call the company that sent her!'
Joey	 I did that too! They wouldn\xc2\x92t give me her real name or her number.\nThey said, "If I bothered them again they\xc2\x92d call the police." I said,\n"If you talk to the police, you tell them I\xc2\x92m missing a ring!"'
Ross	 So what, Joey? Wh-wh-what? What are you telling me? That there\xc2\x92s\nnothing we can do? Well, how could this happen?!'
Joey	 Look Ross, I am so-so sorry. I-I-I\xc2\x85'
Chandler	 Well, what if we just ah, called her, used a fake name, and had her\ncome to my office?'
Joey	 Oh, that sounds like fun, but we\xc2\x92ve got a ring to find!!'
Monica	 Here\xc2\x92s your tea Phoebe. (They give it to her and quickly take a\nstep back.)'
Phoebe	 (sips it) It\xc2\x92s so good. (Monica and Rachel breath a sigh of\nrelief.) Oh, thanks.'
Rachel	 Good.'
Monica	 I\xc2\x92m so glad you liked it.'
Phoebe	 (sets the cup down) Oh! (Grabs her stomach in pain.)'
Monica	 What?!'
Rachel	 What?! She made the tea! (Points to Monica.)'
Phoebe	 Oh! No, I-I think I just had a contraction.'
Rachel	 You what?'
Monica	 Oh my God!'
Phoebe	 Yeah, I thought I had one a couple of minutes ago, and now I know that\nwas definitely one.'
Monica	 Wait, you can\xc2\x92t have the baby here! I mean I haven\xc2\x92t\nsterilised it since the guys moved out!'
Rachel	 Okay. It\xc2\x92s okay. We\xc2\x92re gonna be okay. Y\xc2\x92know what?\nIt\xc2\x92s okay. I\xc2\x92m gonna, I\xc2\x92m gonna, I\xc2\x92m gonna boil some water and just\nrip up some sheets!'
Phoebe	 No. It\xc2\x92s all right; it\xc2\x92s probably false labour. They said\nthat, that can happen near the end, just somebody get the book.'
Monica	 Rachel, get the book! The book!'
Rachel	 Okay! (Runs and grabs a book and hands it to Monica.) Okay! Here!'
Monica	 The Bible?!'
Rachel	 I don\xc2\x92t know!'
Joey	 All right, okay, this is great, uh, Chandler, you get behind the desk.\nAnd-and when she comes in hopefully, she won\xc2\x92t recognise you because, well, why would\nshe? Uh, okay, and then you buzz Ross and I. (to Ross) You be Mr. Gonzalez, and I\xc2\x92ll\nbe uh, Mr. Wong.'
Ross	 Diverse.'
The Stripper	 Did anybody call for security?'
Chandler	 (to Ross) You be cool. (He opens the door and lets her in as they all\nturn there backs on her.)'
The Stripper	 Okay, which one of you guys is Gunther Central-Perk? (Sees Joey.)\nHey, Joey?'
Ross	 Where\xc2\x92s my ring? My dead grandmother\xc2\x92s wedding ring? Where is\nit? Where is it?'
Chandler	 Way to be cool, man.'
The Stripper	 What\xc2\x92s he talking about?'
Joey	 There was a ring, in a box, on my nightstand, after you left, it was gone!'
The Stripper	 Wait, you guys think I stole some ring?'
Ross	 We know you took so just-just save yourself the time and confess!'
The Stripper	 Okay, who are you? The Hardy boys? Look, I don\xc2\x92t need to\nsteal some stupid ring, all right? I make $1,600 a week doing what I do; any of you guys\nmake that?'
Chandler	 Marry me. (Both Ross and Chandler hit him.)'
Joey	 I don\xc2\x92t get it! It was in my room all night! And if she didn\xc2\x92t\ntake it, and I didn\xc2\x92t take it; and you (Chandler) didn\xc2\x92t take it, then who did?\n(The duck quacks.) Shh! We\xc2\x92re trying to think! (Ross and Chandler realise it at the\nsame moment and stare at Joey, who doesn\xc2\x92t get it. After a short pause, with the duck\nstill quacking, Joey figures it out and starts pointing at the duck.)'
Rachel	 I still don\xc2\x92t get how you know when it\xc2\x92s false labour.'
Phoebe	 Well, do you see any babies?'
Monica	 How do you feel?'
Phoebe	 Okay, I guess. I mean\xc2\x85 I don\xc2\x92t know, it\xc2\x92s just, I guess I\nknow it\xc2\x92s going to be over soon.'
Rachel	 Well, isn\xc2\x92t that a good thing? You said you were sick of this.'
Phoebe	 I know. It\xc2\x92s just y\xc2\x92know usually when you\xc2\x92re, when\nyou\xc2\x92re done with the pregnant thing, y\xc2\x92know, then you get to do the mom thing.\nI\xc2\x92m gonna be y\xc2\x92know, sitting around in my leather pants, drinking Tequila.'
Monica	 Some moms do that.'
Phoebe	 Okay that\xc2\x92s even sadder. Look, I know, I know what I got myself\ninto, it\xc2\x92s just that now that they\xc2\x92re in me it\xc2\x92s like, it\xc2\x92s like I\nknow them y\xc2\x92know, I mean-I mean, it\xc2\x92s just not gonna be easy when these little\nbabies have to go away.'
Monica	 Aww, sweetie, but it\xc2\x92s not like you\xc2\x92re not gonna have\nanything. You\xc2\x92re gonna have nieces and nephews, and some ways that\xc2\x92s even\nbetter.'
Phoebe	 Yeah, okay.'
Rachel	 No, really. Really, Pheebs, you\xc2\x92re not gonna be the one worrying\nabout saving for college, or yelling at them when they\xc2\x92re bad, y\xc2\x92know, or\ndeciding to put them on Ritalin when they just won\xc2\x92t calm down. Y\xc2\x92know?'
Monica	 I mean, you\xc2\x92re the one they\xc2\x92re gonna come to when they wanna\nrun away from home, and the one they talk to about sex.'
Rachel	 And you just get to be cool Aunt Phoebe!'
Phoebe	 Cool Aunt Phoebe. I am pretty cool!'
Monica	 Yeah.'
Rachel	 And y\xc2\x92know what else, oh my God, are they gonna love you.'
Phoebe	 They are gonna love me.'
Rachel	 Oh!'
Phoebe	 Thanks you guys! Again.'
Monica	 Oh, sweetie! (They all hug.)'
Phoebe	 You\xc2\x92re the best. Thanks. Oh! '
Phoebe	 Just kidding. Ahh!'
Rachel	 What?!'
Monica	 Oh my God!'
Phoebe	 Got cha again, you guys are so easy.'
Joey	 If anything should happen to him\xc2\x85'
Ross	 Joey! The vet said it\xc2\x92s a simple procedure.'
Joey	 So! Things can go wrong! You don\xc2\x92t know! What if he doesn\xc2\x92t make\nit?!'
Chandler	 He will, Joe.'
Joey	 Yeah, but what if he doesn\xc2\x92t? He\xc2\x92s such a good duck.'
Joey	 I\xc2\x92m so worried about him, y\xc2\x92know?'
The Doctor	 (coming in from surgery) Somebody lose a ring?'
Ross	 Oh my God! Thank you! Thank you so much! (He grabs the ring, kisses it,\nand then does a double-take realising where it\xc2\x92s been.)'
Joey	 H-h-h-how\xc2\x92s the duck?'
The Doctor	 He\xc2\x92s doing just fine, he\xc2\x92s resting now, but you can see\nhim in a little bit.'
Joey	 Ohh, great! Oh hey, listen Ross, thanks for being so cool about this.'
Ross	 No, that\xc2\x92s all right.'
Joey	 No, it\xc2\x92s not. I mean you-you made me your best man and I totally let\nyou down!'
Chandler	 Hey, come on, it\xc2\x92s not your fault.'
Joey	 Yeah, it is! You wouldn\xc2\x92t have lost the ring, right? Y\xc2\x92know\nwhat, Ross you were right from the start, he (Chandler) should be your best man.'
Chandler	 No, you should.'
Joey	 Now, don\xc2\x92t argue with me\xc2\x85'
Ross	 Hey! Hey! Hey! I get to choose my best man, and I want both you\nguys. '
Chandler	 Really?'
Joey	 Really?'
Ross	 Hey, both you guys should be up there with me. I mean, you two are-are\nmy\xc2\x85 I mean, I\xc2\x92m lucky to have just one good\xc2\x85 (They all start getting\nemotional.)'
Chandler	 Thanks man.'
Joey	 (starting to cry) I gotta go check something over here. (He walks away so\nthat they can\xc2\x92t see him cry.)'
Chandler	 What a baby.'
Ross	 Total wuss!'
