Monica	 (quietly) Hi!'
Chandler	 (quietly) Hi! (They both start kissing.)'
Joey	 Monica? What time is it?'
Chandler	 Uhh, 9. (He pushes the clock into the sink.)'
Joey	 But it's dark out."
Monica	 Well that's because you always sleep to noon, silly! This is what 9\nlooks like."
Joey	 I guess I'll get washed up then. Watch that sunrise. (He goes into the\nbathroom.)"
Monica	 I'm really getting tired of sneaking around."
Chandler	 I know, me too. Hey! Y'know what if we went away for a whole weekend?\nY'know we'd have no interruptions and we could be naked the entire time."
Monica	 All weekend? That's a whole lotta naked."
Chandler	 Yeah, I can say that I have a conference and you can say you have a\nchef thing.'
Monica	 Ohh, I've always wanted to go to this culinary fair that they have in\nJersey!"
Chandler	 Okay, y'know your not though. Let's go. (He starts for his bedroom.)"
Monica	 Wait! What about Joey?'

Monica	 (entering from her room) Hey, guess what I'm doing this weekend! I'm\ngoing to this culinary fair in New Jersey."
Phoebe	 Oh weird, Chandler just told us he's got a conference there!"
Monica	 Oh now that-that-that's funny, it seems like Chandler's conference\ncould've been in Connecticut or Vermont."
Chandler	 I'm not in charge of where the conference is held. Do you want people\nto think it's a fake conference? It's a real conference."
Ross	 (entering) Hey.'
Joey	 Hey!'
Monica	 Hey.'
Ross	 Is Rachel here? I gotta talk to her.'
Monica	 No, she's out shopping."
Ross	 Damn!'
Chandler	 What's going on?"
Ross	 I told Emily to come. And I just need to y'know, talk to Rachel about it."
Phoebe	 Wait a minute! So when Emily comes you're just, you're not gonna see\nRachel anymore?"
Ross	 Well look, I\'m just trying to focus on the "I get to see my\nwife," part, all right? And not the part that makes me do this. (He takes a big swig\nof Pepto Bismol.)'
Monica	 Wow, so you guys are, you're never gonna be in the same room together?\nHow is that even gonna work?"
Ross	 I have no idea. I mean\xc2\x85 But-but I assure you I will figure it out.'
Joey	 Doesn\xc2\x92t seem like it's going to work, I mean\xc2\x85"
Rachel	 (entering) Hi, guys!'
Joey	 Hi!'
Chandler	 Uh, hey!'
Rachel	 What's going on?"
Chandler	 We're flipping Monica's mattress."
Joey	 So I'm thinking, basically we pick it up and then we flip it."
Phoebe	 Yeah that's better than my way."
Rachel	 Oh okay, hey guys, would you flip mine too?'
Chandler	 Aww, man! (They go into Monica's room.)"
Rachel	 (going through the mail) Oh look! A letter from my mom.'
Ross	 So, Rach, y'know-y'know how Emily's coming right?"
Rachel	 Oh yeah! I know.'
Phoebe	 (To Chandler) Can you hear anything?'
Chandler	 Oh yes, somebody just said, "Can you hear anything?"'
Monica	 Hey, Joey's ass! What are you doing?"
Joey	 (holding a box) Well, remember when they got in that big fight and broke\nup and we were all stuck in her with no food or anything? Well, when Ross said Rachel at\nthe wedding, I figured it was gonna happen again, so I hid this in here.'
Monica	 Ooh, candy bars, crossword puzzles\xc2\x85'
Phoebe	 Ooh, Madlibs, mine! (Grabs it.)'
Chandler	 Condoms?'
Joey	 You don't know how long we're gonna be in here! We may have to\nrepopulate the Earth."
Chandler	 And condoms are the way to do that?'
Ross	 Anyway it-it kinda-it all boils down to this, the last time I talked to\nEmily\xc2\x85'
Rachel	 (interrupting) Oh my God! My dog died!'
Ross	 What?!'
Rachel	 Oh my God, Le Poo, our dog!'
Ross	 Le Poo's still alive?!"
Rachel	 Oh God, it says he was hit by an ice cream truck and dragged for\nnine-(turns over the note)-teen blocks. Oh. (They all come out from Monica's bedroom) Oh\nmy God."
Monica	 Sweetie, we heard you crying. Please don't cry."
Rachel	 It's Le Poo."
Phoebe	 I know it's le poo right now, but it'll get better."
Chandler	 (jumping on the bed) I can't believe it! We're here!"
Monica	 Ooh, chocolates on the pillows! I love that!'
Chandler	 Oh, you should live with Joey, Roll-os everywhere.'
Monica	 Come here. (He does, and they kiss.) Okay, be right back. '
Chandler	 Oh yes! Monica, get in here! There's a high-speed car chase on!"
Monica	 We're switching rooms."
Chandler	 (looks at what she's holding and shies away) Oh dear God, they gave us\nglasses!"
Monica	 No, they gave us glasses with lipstick on them! I mean, if they didn't\nchange the glasses, who knows what else they didn't change. (He glares at her.) Come on\nsweetie, I just want this weekend to be perfect, I mean we can change rooms, can't we?"
Chandler	 Okay, but let's do it now though, because Chopper 5 just lost it's\nfeed! (He grabs their bags and sprints out.)"
Ross	 Hey, so uh, y'know how there's something I wanted to talk to you about?"
Rachel	 Oh yeah! (Turns to face him.)'
Ross	 Well, y'know how I'm trying to work things out with Emily. Well, there's\nthis one thing\xc2\x85 Okay, (Rachel has her back turned to the camera, and Ross isn't\nlooking at her.) here goes. I made a promise that-(they cut to the other camera and Ross\nnotices something coming out of Rachel's nose)-Oh hey!"
Rachel	 What?'
Ross	 You're nose is bleeding!"
Rachel	 Oh God. (He hands her some tissues.) No! Oh not again! (Wiping her\nnose.) This-this happened when my grandfather died. It's ugh! Sorry. (She puts her head\nback.) Oh, okay, so I'm sorry, what-what were you-what did you want to tell me?"
Ross	 Umm\xc2\x85 (Rachel blows her nose.)'
Rachel	 Sorry. Sorry.'
Ross	 Okay, I uh, I can't see you anymore."
Rachel	 Yeah, I know. It's ridiculous! I can't see you either."
Hotel Clerk	 I think you'll find this room more to your liking."
Chandler	 Okay, great. (He grabs the remote and turns on the TV to the chase.)'
Hotel Clerk	 (watching the chase) They say he's only got half a tank left."
Chandler	 Half a tank? We still got a lot of high-speed chasing to do!'
Monica	 We're switching rooms again."
Chandler	 What? Why?'
Monica	 This is a garden view room, and we paid for an ocean view room.'
Hotel Clerk	 Our last ocean view room was unacceptable to you.'
Monica	 (To Chandler) Excuse me, umm, can I talk to you over here for just a\nsecond?'
Chandler	 Uh-huh. (He doesn't take his eyes off the TV.)"
Monica	 Chandler!'
Chandler	 (turning to face her) Yeah.'
Monica	 Look, these clowns are trying to take us for a ride and I'm not gonna\nlet 'em! And we're not a couple of suckers!"
Chandler	 I hear ya, Mugsy! But look, all these rooms are fine okay? Can you\njust pick one so I can watch-(realizes)-have a perfect, magical weekend together with you.'
Monica	 Okay, this one I like!'
Chandler	 (watching TV, in fact, ER is on.) Nothing! It's over! Dammit! This is\nregularly scheduled programming!"
Monica	 Can we turn the TV off? Okay? Do we really want to spend the entire\nweekend like this?'
Chandler	 Oh, I'm sorry, am I getting in the way of all the room switching fun?"
Monica	 Hey, don't blame me for wigging tonight!"
Chandler	 Oh, who should I blame? The nice bell man who had to drag out luggage\nto 10 different rooms?'
Monica	 I don't know, how about the idiot who thought he could drive from Albany\nto Canada on a half a tank of gas!"
Chandler	 Do not speak ill of the dead.'
Monica	 We're supposed to uh, be spending a romantic weekend together, it-it,\nwhat is the matter with you?"
Chandler	 I just want to watch a little television. What is the big deal? Geez,\nrelax mom.'
Monica	 What did you say?'
Chandler	 I said, "Geez, relax Monnnnn."'
Rachel	 Hi!'
Ross	 Hey. Rachel, I-I-I've been wanting to tell you something for a while now\nand I really, I just have to get it out."
Rachel	 Okay, what's up?"
Ross	 Okay, y'know how you told me I should do whatever it takes to fix my\nmarriage?"
Rachel	 Yeah, I told you to give Emily whatever she wants.'
Ross	 And while that was good advice, you should know that what-what she\nwants\xc2\x85 '
Rachel	 Yeah?'
Ross	 \xc2\x85is for me not to see you anymore.'
Rachel	 That's crazy! You can't do that! What are you going to tell her? (Pause)\n(Realizes) Oh God. Ohh, you already agreed to this, haven't you?"
Ross	 It's awful I know, I mean, I feel terrible but I have to do this if I want\nmy marriage to work. And I do, I have to make this marriage work. I have too. But\nthe good thing is we can still see each other until she gets here."
Rachel	 Ohh! Lucky me! Oh my God! That is good news, Ross! I think that's\nthe best news I've heard since Le Poo died!"
Ross	 You have no idea what a nightmare this has been. This is so hard.'
Rachel	 Oh yeah, really? Is it Ross? Yeah? Okay, well let me make this a just a\nlittle bit easier for you.'
Ross	 What are you doing?'
Rachel	 Storming out!'
Ross	 Rachel, this is your apartment.'
Rachel	 Yeah, well that's how mad I am!!"

Chandler	 Damn Rollos!'
Joey	 Hey, you're back!"
Chandler	 Hey.'
Joey	 How was your conference?'
Chandler	 It was terrible. I fought with (Pause) my colleagues y'know, the\nentire time. Are you kidding with this? (Throws away another Rollo)"
Joey	 Oh, so your weekend was a total bust?'
Chandler	 Uh, no, I got to see Donald Trump waiting for an elevator.'
Monica	 (entering) Hi!'
Joey	 Hey, you're back too!"
Monica	 Yeah. Umm, Chandler can I talk to you outside for a second?'
Joey	 Hey, how was your chef thing?'
Monica	 Oh, it was awful. (To Chandler) I guess some people just don't\nappreciate really good food."
Chandler	 Well, maybe it was the kind of food that tasted good at first but then\nmade everybody vomit and have diarrhea.'
Monica	 Chandler! (Motions for him to come outside.)'
Chandler	 Monica. (Follows her out.)'
Monica	 Okay, I'd like to know how much the room was because I'd like to pay my\nhalf."
Chandler	 Okay, fine, $300.'
Monica	 300 dollars?!'
Chandler	 Yeah, just think of it as $25 per room!'
Monica	 Urghh!!'
Joey	 (sticking his head out the door) What are you guys woofing about?'
Monica	 Chandler stole a twenty from my purse!'
Joey	 Nooooo!!! Y'know what? Now that I think about it, I constantly find myself\nwithout twenties and you always have lots!"
Ross	 You should've seen the look on her face. I don't want Rachel to hate me! I\ndon't know what to do."
Joey	 You want my advice?'
Ross	 Yes! Please!'
Joey	 You're not gonna like it."
Ross	 That's okay."
Joey	 You got married to fast.'
Ross	 That's not advice!"
Joey	 I told ya.'
Ross	 I'm going to the bathroom. (Gets up and exits.)"
Joey	 Man, if anyone asked me to give up any of you, I couldn't do it."
Chandler and Phoebe	 Yeah, me either.'
Monica	 Maybe I could do it.'
Rachel	 (entering) Hi!'
Joey	 Hi, Rach.'
Chandler	 Hi!'
Phoebe	 Hey.'
Monica	 Hey.'
Rachel	 Look, I know you guys heard about the whole thing with me and Ross but\ny'know, I've been obsessing about it all day and I'd just love not to talk about\nit. All right?"
Joey	 I-I-I don't know if this falls under this category, but uh, Ross is right\nback there. (Points over his shoulder.)"
Rachel	 That's not Ross!"
Phoebe	 Oh no! Not that guy! He does look like him though.'
Chandler	 Okay, Ross is in the bathroom.'
Rachel	 Oh my God, its happening. It's already started. I'm Kip."
Joey	 Hey, you're not Kip!"
Rachel	 (To Joey) Do you even know who Kip is?'
Joey	 Who cares? You're Rachel! (To Chandler) Who's Kip?"
Chandler	 Kip, my old roommate, y'know we all used to hang out together."
Joey	 Oh, that poor bastard.'
Rachel	 See? Yeah, you told me the story. He and Monica dated when they broke up\nthey couldn't even be in the same room together and you all promised that you would stay\nhis friend and what happened? He got phased out!"
Monica	 You're not gonna be phased out!"
Rachel	 Well, of course I am! It's not gonna happen to Ross! He's your brother.\n(To Chandler) He's your old college roommate. Ugh, it was just a matter of time before\nsomeone had to leave the group. I just always assumed Phoebe would be the one to go."
Phoebe	 Ehh!!'
Rachel	 Honey, come on! You live far away! You're not related. You lift right\nout."
Chandler	 (entering) Hey!'
Joey	 Hey, Mr. Bing. That uh, hotel you stayed at called. Said someone left an\neyelash curler in your room.'
Chandler	 Yes that was mine.'
Joey	 'Cause I figured you'd hooked up with some girl and she'd left it there."
Chandler	 Yes that would have made more sense.'
Joey	 Y'know, I-I don't even feel like I know you anymore man! All right, look,\nI'm just gonna ask you this one time. And whatever you say, I'll believe ya. (Pause.) Were\nyou, or were you not on a gay cruise?!"
Rachel	 Phoebe? (She turns her head further away.) I'm sorry about the whole\nlifting out thing. (Moves over next to her.) You gotta come with me!"
Phoebe	 Come where?'
Rachel	 Wherever I go. Come on you and me, we'll-we'll start a new group, we're\nthe best ones."
Phoebe	 Okay, but try and get Joey too.'
Ross	 (entering) Pheebs, you mind if I speak to Rachel alone for a sec?'
Phoebe	 Oh, sure! (She gets up to leave.) Bye Ross! (Whispering behind his\nback.) Forever.'
Ross	 Hi.'
Rachel	 Hi. What are you doing here? Isn't this against the rules?"
Ross	 I talked to Monica, look, I'm the one who made the choice. I'm the\none who's making things change, so I should be the one to y'know, step back."
Rachel	 Oh, Ross\xc2\x85'
Ross	 No, no, it's okay. Really. They're plenty of people who just see their\nsisters at Thanksgiving and just see their college roommates at reunions and just see Joey\nat Burger King. So is, is that better?"
Rachel	 No, it's not better. I still don't get to see you."
Ross	 Well, what-what would you do? Rach, if you were me, what-what would you\ndo?'
Rachel	 Well, for starters I would've said the right name at my wedding!"
Ross	 I can't believe this is happening."
Rachel	 I know.'
Ross	 I am so sorry.'
Rachel	 I know that too.'
Joey	 (entering) (He clears his throat to get their attention.) Hey, Rach? Sorry\nto interrupt but umm, Phoebe wanted me to talk to you about a trip or something.'
Chandler	 (entering) Hey!'
Monica	 Hi.'
Chandler	 I just came over to drop off\xc2\x85nothing. So that weekend kinda\nsucked, huh?'
Monica	 Yeah, it did.'
Chandler	 So, I guess this is over.'
Monica	 What?'
Chandler	 Well, y'know, you and me, it had to end sometime."
Monica	 Why, exactly?'
Chandler	 Because of the weekend, we had a fight.'
Monica	 Chandler that's crazy! If you give up every time you'd have a fight with\nsomeone you'd never be with anyone longer than\xc2\x97Ohhh! (They both realize something\nthere.)"
Chandler	 So, this isn't over?"
Monica	 (laughs) You are so cute! No. No, it was a fight. You deal with it and\nmove on! It's nothing to freak out about."
Chandler	 Really? Okay. Great!'
Monica	 Ohh, welcome to an adult relationship! (She goes to kiss him.)'
Chandler	 (stops her) We're in a relationship?"
Monica	 I'm afraid so."
Chandler	 Okay.'
Phoebe	 Hey!'
Monica	 Hey!'
Phoebe	 Oh hey, Monica, I heard you saw Donald Trump at your convention.'
Monica	 Yeah, I saw him waiting for an elevator.'
Monica	 Hey, Rach, can I borrow your eyelash curler, I think I lost mine.'
Rachel	 Yeah, it's in there. (Points to the bathroom.)"
Joey	 (shocked) Oh! Ohh! Oh!!'
Chandler	 Joey, can I talk to you for a second? (He grabs him and starts to drag\nJoey into Monica's room.)"
Joey	 Oohh!! Ohh! Oh-oh-oh! Oh-oh!!'
Joey	 Ohhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!'
Chandler	 Yes. Yes. (Lets him up.)'
Joey	 (To Chandler) You?! (To Monica) And-and you?!'
Monica	 Yes, but you cannot tell anyone! No one knows!'
Joey	 How?! When?!'
Chandler	 It happened in London.'
Joey	 IN LONDON!!!'
Chandler	 The reason we didn't tell anyone was because we didn't want to make a\nbig deal out of it."
Joey	 But it is a big deal!! I have to tell someone! '
Chandler	 No-no-no-no-no! You can't!"
Monica	 Please? Please?! We just don't want to deal with telling everyone, okay?\nJust promise you won't tell."
Joey	 All right! Man, this is unbelievable! I mean, it's great, but\xc2\x85"
Monica	 I know, it's great!"
Joey	 Aww, I don't want to see that!"
Phoebe	 We're so stupid! Do you know what's going on in there? They're trying to\ntake Joey!"

Phoebe	 The most popular Phoebe in tennis is called the overhand Phoebe. And if\nyou win, you must slap your opponent on the Phoebe and say, "Hi, Phoebe!"'
Monica	 Oh that's cute! We really all enjoyed it. But y'know, it doesn't count."
Phoebe	 Count for what?'
Monica	 Count in our heads as-as good Madlibs.'
Joey	 I guess I'm done."
Chandler	 Fun's over!"
Monica	 Wait-wait, guys! If-if we follow the rules, it's still fun and it means\nsomething!"
Rachel	 Uh-huh!'
Joey	 I think I'm gonna take-off."
Monica	 Guys, rules are good! Rules help control the fun! (They all leave and\nclose the door on Monica.) Ohhh! (Throws her notepad down in disgust.)'
