Rachel	 Okay, Chandler!'
Chandler	 Okay.'
Rachel	 And your horoscope says, "On the fifth a special someone is going\nto give you a gift."'
Chandler	 (To Monica) Oh, well thank you in advance. (Kisses her.)'
Rachel	 Op, but the twelfth brings a lover\xc2\x92s spat.'
Monica	 (To Chandler) You are going to make a joke about my special\npresent! Why would you do that?!'
Rachel	 Oh, wait and on the nineteenth a secret crush announces itself.'
Joey	 (entering) Hey guys!'
Chandler	 Hey!!'
Rachel	 (ecstatic) Oh my God! It\xc2\x92s Joey Tribbiani of Mac and\nC.H.E.E.S.E.!!!!!!!'
Chandler	 Oh that\xc2\x92s right. It\xc2\x92s your first day! So are you psyched to\nfight fake crime with your robot sidekick?'
Joey	 Am I psyched? The lead in my own TV series? I\xc2\x92ve dreamed about this\nfor years! Why have I not been preparing?!'
Phoebe	 No! Joey, you\xc2\x92re going to be great!'
Joey	 But I got to act with a robot Pheebs, and-and I don\xc2\x92t know anything\nabout technology! I can\xc2\x92t even use Chandler\xc2\x92s computer except to find porn!\nAnd-and that\xc2\x92s only \xc2\x91cause it\xc2\x92s right there when you turn it on!'
Monica	 I think our lover\xc2\x92s spat will start a little early this month.'
Phoebe	 (in a sexy voice to Chandler) I\xc2\x92ll be waiting.'

Chandler	 Are you judging them by their covers? Because you\xc2\x92re really not\nsupposed to do that.'
Phoebe	 No, I\xc2\x92m just deciding which one to use\xc2\x97I\xc2\x92m gonna start\nwriting another book!'
Rachel	 Be-because the last one was such a big seller?'
Phoebe	 Well, if you must know I have written 14 books. And as I am the only one\nwho has read them, I can tell you that they all have been very well received. '
Ross	 (entering) Hey!'
Chandler	 Hey!'
Rachel	 Hey!'
Ross	 What are you guys doing later?'
Phoebe	 Oh, Rachel and I have appointments to get our hair cut.'
Rachel	 (To Phoebe) We do?'
Phoebe	 I want to see what he wants first.'
Rachel	 Okay.'
Ross	 (continuing) I just found out that Elizabeth\xc2\x92s dad wants to meet me.'
Chandler	 Wait a minute, hold the phone! You\xc2\x92re not Elizabeth\xc2\x92s dad?!'
Ross	 Come on guys, I-I really want this guy to like me. It-it would really help\nme out if you guys were here to make me look good.'
All	 Of course we\xc2\x92ll help! Yeah! We\xc2\x92ll be here!'
Ross	 Thanks!'
Monica	 We know how tough those parent/teacher conferences can be.'
The Producer	 (walking into Mac\xc2\x92s office) So uh, here\xc2\x92s your office\nset!'
Joey	 Wow! Huh? (Picks up the phone) Mac Macaveli, Private Investigator!'
The Producer	 (checking his watch) Let\xc2\x92s get you into wardrobe for a\nfitting.'
Joey	 Okay. Hey uh, when do I get to meet the robot?'
The Producer	 I\xc2\x92m sorry, why don\xc2\x92t we do that right now? He\xc2\x92s\nright here. (Points to a guy.)'
Joey	 Okay.'
The Producer	 Joey Tribbiani, this is\xc2\x85'
Joey	 Oh wow! He\xc2\x92s so lifelike! (Starts touching the guy\xc2\x92s cheeks)\nUnbelievable! (He starts tugging on the guy\xc2\x92s ears.'
The Producer	 This is Wayne, the man who created and operates C.H.E.E.S.E.'
Joey	 (slaps Wayne on his cheek) How do you do there, Wayne? (Backs away.)'
The Producer	 I\xc2\x92ll let you two guys get acquainted, huh? (Walks away.)'
Joey	 Okay. Sorry about that\xc2\x85(Mimics that cheek thing he just did.) Uh, so\nwhere\xc2\x92s C.H.E.E.S.E.?'
Wayne	 C.H.E.E.S.E. is right here. (He puts on his headset, picks up the\ncontroller, and wheels C.H.E.E.S.E. in. C.H.E.E.S.E. is just a plain old robot on tracks;\nhe kinda looks like No. 5 in the movie Short Circuit.)'
C.H.E.E.S.E.	 (Wayne with a computerized voice) Nice to meet you Mac!'
Joey	 (laughs) This is like the temporary robot, right?'
Wayne	 No. Why?'
Joey	 Well, I-I just, I just it was going to be like a really cool robot,\ny\xc2\x92know? Like the terminator or uh, when I first saw you.'
Wayne	 I spent two years developing this machine, it\xc2\x92s absolutely state of\nthe art.'
Joey	 I\xc2\x92m sorry, it just\xc2\x97I don\xc2\x92t know it doesn\xc2\x92t really look\nlike it can do anything.'
Wayne	 It can do this. (He moves C.H.E.E.S.E.\xc2\x92s arm close to Joey\xc2\x92s\nspecial area and he jumps back.)'
Elizabeth	 This is my father, Paul Stevens. Dad, this is Ross Geller.'
Ross	 It-it\xc2\x92s great to meet you Paul.'
Paul	 I usually prefer Elizabeth\xc2\x92s boyfriends to address me as Mr. Stevens.'
Ross	 Of course, of course, Mr. Stevens.'
Paul	 So Ross, what your problem?'
Ross	 Eh-wh\xc2\x97Excuse me?'
Paul	 Why can\xc2\x92t you get a girlfriend your own age?'
Ross	 That\xc2\x92s funny. Umm\xc2\x85. (Pause, then serious) It\xc2\x92s not funny.'
Paul	 I don\xc2\x92t like you going out with my daughter Ross.'
Ross	 Okay. I can, I can see that. Umm, but I think if you give me umm, one\nchance I can, I can change your mind.'
Paul	 Okay.'
Ross	 What?'
Paul	 Okay. I\xc2\x92ll give you one chance to change my mind. (Ross laughs in\nrelief) You got one minute. (Ross suddenly gets worried.)'
Elizabeth	 Daddy!'
Paul	 Fine! Two minutes. Go.'
Ross	 This is\xc2\x97you\xc2\x97(Ross starts laughing.)'
Paul	 (laughs then checking his watch) 1 minute 50 seconds.'
Ross	 Okay, umm I want you to know that I have never done anything like this\nbefore. I mean, I mean I\xc2\x92ve been in um, relationships in general, uh but I have never\ndone it with a student\xc2\x97I mean I not\xc2\x97not it! I mean, I mean I\ndon\xc2\x92t\xc2\x97We haven\xc2\x92t done it. Uh, I mean, I mean,\nwe\xc2\x92ve-we\xc2\x92ve-we\xc2\x92ve done stuff. (Paul is not amused.) Okay, okay, a joke, a\njoke\xc2\x97lighten the mood. Umm, two guys go into a bar. One of them is Irish.'
Paul	 I\xc2\x92m Irish.'
Ross	 And the Irish guy wins the joke!'
Monica	 Ross!!'
Chandler	 Ross!'
Monica	 How crazy that we\xc2\x92d run into you!'
Ross	 Oh God, thank you! (Runs and gives all of them a group hug.) Umm, uh, Mr.\nStevens I\xc2\x92d like you to meet my friends uh, this is Phoebe, Monica, and Chandler.'
Phoebe	 You\xc2\x92re Elizabeth\xc2\x92s father, huh? I can see now where she gets\nher rugged handsomeness.'
Monica	 (obviously attracted to him) Is-is-is there a-a Mrs. Stevens?'
Chandler	 There\xc2\x92s a Mr. Bing!'
Paul	 No, unfortunately Lizzie\xc2\x92s mom passed away shortly after she was\nborn. I raised her by myself.'
Phoebe and Monica	 (sympathetic) Ohh!'
Paul	 I get that a lot.'
Ross	 Okay umm, why don\xc2\x92t we all take a seat, y\xc2\x92know? And uh, and\nI\xc2\x92ll get us all some uh some coffees\xc2\x97(He goes to pull out Elizabeth\xc2\x92s\nchair, but Paul steps in)\xc2\x97Yeah, why don\xc2\x92t you. (Paul pulls out her chair) Uh and\nyou guys can talk about whatever, whatever you want. Y\xc2\x92know? Whatever pops into your\nhead. (He turns his back to Paul and Elizabeth and points to himself for Chandler, Monica,\nand Phoebe. Then he goes to order the coffee.)'
Monica	 Y\xc2\x92know, it is so strange seeing Ross here this time of day,\n\xc2\x91cause usually he\xc2\x92s got the children\xc2\x92s hospital.'
Phoebe	 Yeah. Not looking for dates. (Monica turns in horror.)'
Elizabeth	 So uh, Monica is Ross\xc2\x92s sister.'
Monica	 And he\xc2\x92s a great brother!'
Paul	 I had a sister.'
Monica	 Ohh!'
Paul	 She passed away.'
Monica and Phoebe	 (sympathetic) Ohh!'
Paul	 Oh, you don\xc2\x92t have to do that every time.'
Chandler	 But uh Ross, Ross is a great guy! I was roommates with him in college.\nUh, funny story\xc2\x85 (He starts laughing then notices that Paul isn\xc2\x92t happy.)\nYou\xc2\x92re roommate in college died didn\xc2\x92t he?'
Paul	 A part of him did yes.'
Ross	 (returning with the coffee) Okay here we are Paul, Elizabeth. (He sets\ndown their cups.) So I hope you guys were finding something to talk about.'
Chandler	 Yes, we were just\xc2\x85'
Rachel	 Hi, I\xc2\x92m sorry I\xc2\x92m late but I am ready, ready to talk you up!\nWhen does Liz\xc2\x92s father get here?'
Paul	 I\xc2\x92m already here.'
Rachel	 Oh! Ross is sooo great!'
Chandler	 Hey honey, you got the kind with the little girl, you said we were\ngonna to get the kind with the baby.'
Monica	 No, you said the baby creeps you out.'
Chandler	 No, the little girl creeps me out.'
Monica	 You said the baby.'
Chandler	 Why would the baby creep me out?'
Monica	 Why would the little girl creep you out?'
Phoebe	 (writing frantically) You guys, I\xc2\x92m sorry, could you please talk a\nlittle slower? '
Chandler	 This is going in your book?'
Phoebe	 Yeah, it\xc2\x92s about relationships. Y\xc2\x92know? The traps, the\npitfalls, what not to do, keep going. This stuff is great!'
Monica	 What?! Excuse me!'
Phoebe	 And how none of it matters when the people really love each other.\n(Chandler and Monica kiss.) And how people will believe anything you tell them as long as\nit\xc2\x92s a compliment.'
Rachel	 (seeing him) Oh hi!'
Paul	 Hi! Hi. (He\xc2\x92s looking around.) I think I left my keys here somewhere.'
Rachel	 Oh! Well let\xc2\x92s look for them. (Finds some under one of the couch\ncushions. It has a pink, fuzzy ball on the key chain.) Oh-oh-hey! Are these them?'
Paul	 No.'
Rachel	 All right! (Throws them back under the cushion.)'
Paul	 Oh, here they are right here. (Picks them up from underneath the corner of\nthe couch.)'
Rachel	 Oh good.'
Paul	 Thanks for your help. (Starts to leave.)'
Rachel	 (chasing after him) Oh, wait! Sorry, Mr. Paul? Mr. Paul?'
Paul	 Just call me Paul.'
Rachel	 Paul. Umm, I just wanted you to know that Ross really is a great guy.'
Paul	 Well maybe you can date him then that would save me the trouble of killing\nhim. (Rachel laughs then starts looking at him.) Are you okay?'
Rachel	 You just don\xc2\x92t look old enough to have a twenty-year-old daughter.'
Paul	 Well, we were very young when we had her.'
Rachel	 Oh. We?'
Paul	 Well yeah, it usually, it takes two people to\xc2\x85 (He taps his index\nfingers together.)'
Rachel	 Oh no! Yes! Of course, I know that! I just\xc2\x97I meant y\xc2\x92know are\nyou still a \xc2\x91We\xc2\x92 or are you just \xc2\x91You?\xc2\x92'
Paul	 I\xc2\x92m just me, my wife died shortly after Lizzie was born.'
Rachel	 (sympathetic) Ohh. So you raised her all on your own?'
Paul	 Yes I did.'
Rachel	 Ohh. (She touches his arm for support and likes what she feels) Ooh!'
Joey	 Hey!'
Chandler	 Hey!'
Phoebe	 Hey!'
Monica	 How was your first day?'
Joey	 Pretty great! Except I did get a little attitude from the robot.'
Chandler	 Damn those robots, they\xc2\x92re supposed to be our faithful\nservants!'
Joey	 Anyway, it wasn\xc2\x92t the robot, it was the guy who controls him. Yeah,\nhe doesn\xc2\x92t like me. He had C.H.E.E.S.E. knock over the sandwich right when I was\nreaching for one! Ohh!'
Phoebe	 Well, why don\xc2\x92t you just get him fired?'
Joey	 I may have to, I hate to do it, but I\xc2\x92m the star! Y\xc2\x92know?\nThere\xc2\x92s a limit to how many sandwiches I can eat off the floor. (His cell phone\nrings) Excuse me. (Answers it, on phone) Joey Tribbiani. '
Estelle	 (on the other end) Joe! I\xc2\x92m glad I found ya, I got an audition for\nya!'
Joey	 Wow!'
Estelle	 The thing is it\xc2\x92s kinda on the Q.T. The actor who has the part\ndoesn\xc2\x92t know he might be fired. It\xc2\x92s the lead in a series, Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.'
Joey	 I\xc2\x92m the lead in Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.!!'
Estelle	 Uh-oh!'
Ross	 Joey?!'
Paul	 Hi Ross.'
Rachel	 I was just getting him to like you.'

Ross	 Joey?! Joey!! (He runs into his bedroom.)'
Rachel	 Ross, Joey is not here.'
Ross	 Okay, I\xc2\x92ll just wait for him in here!'
Rachel	 Ross, it\xc2\x92s okay. You can come out.'
Paul	 Yeah Ross it\xc2\x92s okay, it\xc2\x92s me, Mr. Stevens.'
Ross	 (coming out of the bedroom) Oh! Oh my God! I didn\xc2\x92t even see you!'
Paul	 Sure you did! You came in, you got all awkward, and you ran into the\nbedroom. You were shouting, "Joey! Joey!" Bye Rach. (Kisses her.)'
Rachel	 Bye!'
Paul	 I\xc2\x92ll call you later. Bye Ross. (Leaves)'
Ross	 What-what-what the\xc2\x97how da-how did-what the-how did-what?!'
Rachel	 Well, y\xc2\x92know he lost his keys so he was looking for them\xc2\x85'
Ross	 (incredulous) In your mouth?!'
Rachel	 No! Downstairs! And we got to talking y\xc2\x92know, for like two hours,\nand I really liked him so I invited him up here for a cup of coffee.'
Ross	 You were at the coffeehouse!'
Rachel	 Ross, what\xc2\x92s the big deal? So I kissed the guy!'
Ross	 He is my girlfriend\xc2\x92s father, okay? It\xc2\x92s-it\xc2\x92s, it\xc2\x92s\nweird!'
Rachel	 Wh\xc2\x97You dated my sister!'
Ross	 That was different!'
Rachel	 What? Why?!'
Ross	 This is weird for me!'
Rachel	 Ross look, look this is good for you. Okay? Let\xc2\x92s face it, so far\nthe guy\xc2\x92s not lovin\xc2\x92 ya! But I can turn that around! I got the inside track! We\ncan all go out to dinner, y\xc2\x92know? And I can talk you up! Ross, the guy is a very, very\nsuccessful lawyer!'
Ross	 How is that important?'
Rachel	 Oh it\xc2\x92s important!'
Joey	 Apparently, there\xc2\x92s like a million guys out there that can play Mac,\nand there\xc2\x92s only this one robot and this one guy who controls it! I didn\xc2\x92t know\nhe could get me fired! What am I going to do?'
Monica	 Well y\xc2\x92know Joey, you\xc2\x92re a pretty charming guy.'
Joey	 Thanks, but I kinda have a problem to deal with here.'
Monica	 No sweetie, you\xc2\x92ve got to win over the guy that controls\nC.H.E.E.S.E.! You\xc2\x92ve got to kiss some serious robot ass!'
Joey	 That\xc2\x92s not a bad idea. Yeah. Okay, but if I got to turn on the charm\ntomorrow I\xc2\x92m not wasting anymore of it over here with you guys. (Starts to leave, but\nstops and turns to Phoebe.) Well, actually I got a little bit saved for you Pheebs.\n(Exits.)'
Chandler	 So do you think uh, Joey\xc2\x92s more charming than me?'
Monica	 Yeah! That\xc2\x92s why I\xc2\x92m sleeping with him on the side.'
Chandler	 Yeah, you wish. (Stops to think about it and gets depressed.)'
Phoebe	 (writing in her book) "You wish."'
Monica	 Phoebe, stop writing about us!'
Phoebe	 I\xc2\x92m not writing about you! I\xc2\x92m writing about other people.'
Chandler	 Who?'
Phoebe	 Marcia and Chester.'
Monica	 Okay fine! Fine! Then you know what, I\xc2\x92ll just write about Phyllis!\nHmm!'
Chandler	 Hmm.'
Monica	 (writing on a piece of paper) Phyllis is sitting in a chair.'
Chandler	 Oh.'
Phoebe	 I see what you\xc2\x92re doing!'
Monica	 (still writing) Phyllis sees what I\xc2\x92m doing.'
Chandler	 Oh-oh.'
Phoebe	 Ooh, I have tasted my own medicine and it is bitter!'
Joey	 Morning! Hey, how\xc2\x92s my favorite genius and my little robot buddy?!\n(Pats C.H.E.E.S.E. on the head.)'
Wayne	 Don\xc2\x92t touch him!'
Joey	 Okay! (He yanks his hand away.) All right. Umm, all right Wayne, level\nwith me. Okay? I-I keep hearing all these rumors that I might get fired. Okay, they even\nhave actors coming in to read for my part! Come on man, you-you got to give me a second\nchance! I mean, I love-I love this little guy! (He grabs C.H.E.E.S.E.\xc2\x92s arm and pulls\nit off at the elbow.) Ah-ah!! (Wayne is shocked.) Okay, that\xc2\x92s why you didn\xc2\x92t\nwant me to touch him right? Here you go! Okay? (Hands Wayne the arm and he goes to fix it.\nMeanwhile Joey starts to berate himself.) Stupid! I can\xc2\x92t believe it! God! (A very\nbeautiful woman walks by.) (To her) Hey, how you doin\xc2\x92? (He and her go over to talk\nand Wayne looks on with envy.)'
Rachel	 So it seemed that my prom date had stood me up, so Ross selflessly,\noffered to take me.'
Elizabeth	 What a nice story!'
Paul	 So Ross was in college and decided to jump at the chance to take a young\ngirl to her high school prom.'
Rachel	 Wow! I definitely did not see that one backfiring! I\xc2\x92m gonna\ngo to the bathroom.'
Ross	 Yeah, take your time. '
Ross	 (to Paul) Just-just so you know I was a freshman and she was a senior. So\nit wasn\xc2\x92t as bad as-as\xc2\x85'
Paul	 Ross, look, I know I\xc2\x92ve been giving you a lot of jabs and it\xc2\x92s\npartly because I\xc2\x92m very protective of Lizzie, and partly because well, they just keep\ncoming to me. But I have to admit that after all the wonderful things that Lizzie has told\nme and the many, many, (pause) many stories that Rachel has told me that, well (pause)\nyou\xc2\x92re not (pause) all bad.'
Ross	 Not all bad.'
Paul	 And anyhow, I\xc2\x92m sorry I was so harsh before, but you have to\nunderstand that I (pause) still look at Lizzie like she\xc2\x92s a twelve-year-old girl.'
Ross	 Yeah. You know what? I know what you mean; I do that too.'
Paul	 I beg your pardon?'
Ross	 No! No! Not\xc2\x97I don\xc2\x92t mean I-I see her as a twelve-year-old girl!\nI mean I-I have a son, who\xc2\x92s umm six and I still think of him as a baby.'
Paul	 You have a son?'
Ross	 Yeah, well my-my ex-wife and I share custody of Ben and umm, uh, and just\nso you know, Carol and I are on excellent terms as I\xc2\x92m sure you are with your\nwife! (Realizes) Oh, I\xc2\x92m sorry! (To Elizabeth) It\xc2\x92s unbelievable!'
Paul	 Don\xc2\x92t worry about it, I just didn\xc2\x92t realize you were married.\n(Rachel returns and hears that.) '
Rachel	 Oh we were, but that was just a (pause as the audience reacts), I mean\nthat was just a big drunken mistake.'
Ross	 You\xc2\x92re back.'
Paul	 You two were married?!'
Rachel	 Oh! Whoops! I\xc2\x92m sorry, you were talking about Emily!'
Monica	 Chandler, we said we would meet at the coffeehouse at six.'
Chandler	 We said seven!'
Monica	 We said six!'
Chandler	 The only way that I said six would be if the seven\xc2\x92s, let meet at\nseven, not at six.'
Monica	 Yeah and if I had seven, maybe I would\xc2\x92ve said something like this,\n"Wow! My boyfriend\xc2\x92s such a wise ass\xc2\x97seven!"'
Phoebe	 (Turning around in the chair) Hi!'
Chandler	 Oh my good God.'
Monica	 Ugh!'
Phoebe	 I know what time you said.'
Chandler	 What?!'
Phoebe	 Well actually, I know what time Chester and Marcia said.'
Monica	 What time?'
Phoebe	 Quite an interesting turn of events, suddenly it\xc2\x92s my book to the\nrescue, huh? (Reading her book) Ooh, very interesting. Yeah, well this certainly clears\nthings up.'
Chandler	 (disgusted) What does it say?!'
Phoebe	 I will tell you as soon as you thank me for writing my book.'
Chandler	 Thank you for writing your book. Its-its uh, great book and you are\nthe queen of everything.'
Phoebe	 Thanks! So are you.'
Chandler	 (To Monica) I told you I should not wear this color. (He\xc2\x92s\nwearing a reddish-orange sweater.)'
Phoebe	 (reading from her book) Mon\xc2\x85 (Pause as she restarts) Marcia and\nChester are planning on seeing a movie on Sunday night. Marcia thinks they\xc2\x92re\nsupposed to meet at six, Chester thinks it\xc2\x92s at seven.'
Chandler	 So you knew we were gonna miss the movie!'
Phoebe	 That\xc2\x92s right.'
Monica	 Inside of telling us you decided to write in your stupid book!'
Phoebe	 (writing in her book) Marcia and Chester are mad at Phyllis.'
Joey	 I can\xc2\x92t believe I\xc2\x92m going to lose this job!'
Chandler	 Oh I\xc2\x92m so sorry man! Is there anything I can do?'
Joey	 Yeah! Help me get this mini-fridge past the security guard.'
Wayne	 Hey Joey, I want to talk to you.'
Joey	 Yeah? Well, I don\xc2\x92t want to talk to you Wayne! I hate you! You ruined\nmy life! Oh, Chandler, Wayne. Wayne, Chandler. (They shake hands.)'
Chandler	 Hi, how are ya?'
Wayne	 Joey, Joey, I-I-I\xc2\x92ll g-get you your job back if you help me out.'
Joey	 (incredulous) Why should I help you?!'
Chandler	 (whispering in Joey\xc2\x92s ear) The reason he just said.'
Joey	 (happily) What do you need?'
Wayne	 I-I-I saw you on stage talking to that beautiful woman, y\xc2\x92know\nSarah? '
Joey	 Yeah?'
Wayne	 I wish I could talk to her.'
Joey	 What are you in love with her or something?'
Wayne	 Yeah. Her. All of them. Anyone.'
Chandler	 Yeah, I\xc2\x92ve been there my friend.'
Wayne	 Listen, I-I guarantee you keep your job if you can teach me how to talk\nto women like you do.'
Joey	 Oh wow Wayne, it\xc2\x92s not really something you can teach y\xc2\x92know?\nIt\xc2\x92s pretty much something you\xc2\x92re born with if you\xc2\x97(Off Chandler\xc2\x92s\nlook)\xc2\x97You-you can teach it! I\xc2\x92ll show you right how to do it.'
Rachel	 I mean if you think about it, I mean Ross did learn something from each\nmarriage.'
Paul	 How to make the next one even shorter?'
Rachel	 Now wait a minute that\xc2\x92s not fair. He was married to me a hell of a\nlot longer than he was married to Emily, he just didn\xc2\x92t tell me. (Everyone looks at\nher, Ross not happily.) Maybe I have to pee again. (Gets up to try to use the bathroom.)'
Paul	 Well, this is fun. So Ross, did you kill any of these wives?'
Ross	 Y\xc2\x92know what? I-I-I\xc2\x85 I-I have had enough of this! Y\xc2\x92know,\nI-I-I care a great deal about your daughter and I have treated her with nothing but\nrespect! So if-if you\xc2\x92ve got a problem with me, frankly\xc2\x85'
Paul	 Are you yelling at me?!'
Ross	 God no!'
Elizabeth	 Y\xc2\x92know what daddy? If you don\xc2\x92t like Ross, that\xc2\x92s\nfine. It doesn\xc2\x92t matter to me, I\xc2\x92m gonna go out with him anyway.'
Paul	 Really?! (She nods in the affirmative.)'
Ross	 Well if it doesn\xc2\x92t matter to her, it doesn\xc2\x92t matter to me! (to\nPaul) Still not yelling!'
Paul	 Wow. What can I say? (Pause, pointing at Ross) This doesn\xc2\x92t make me\nlike you any better!'
Ross	 That\xc2\x92s okay, I\xc2\x92m not so crazy about myself right now either.'
Paul	 Then we agree?'
Ross	 Uh yeah, I guess\xc2\x97Yeah! I guess so.'
Paul	 Neither of us like Ross!'
Elizabeth	 I like Ross.'
Ross	 Ohhh! Kids!'
Rachel	 (returning) Wait-wait-wait, I just thought of another story about how\nnice Ross is!'
Ross	 That\xc2\x92s okay Rach, we\xc2\x92re not liking Ross right now.'
Rachel	 Oh! I\xc2\x92ve got a lot of those too!'

Joey	 Well, it turns out you were right C.H.E.E.S.E.'
C.H.E.E.S.E.	 The shipment never made it through Omaha?'
Joey	 You got it! And the rabbi\xc2\x92s beard, 100% horsehair. Nice catch\nC.H.E.E.S.E.! (Pauses as he waits for C.H.E.E.S.E.\xc2\x92s next line.) It\xc2\x92s your line\nC.H.E.E.S.E.! (Suddenly C.H.E.E.S.E. goes crazy and starts flinging it\xc2\x92s arms and\nadvancing on Joey behind the desk.) Wayne! Wayne!!'
