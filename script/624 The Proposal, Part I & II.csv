Monica	 What are you doing?'
Chandler	 (trying to cover up why his hand is over his heart) One nation, under\nGod. Indivisible with liberty and justice for all. (Laughs.) I remembered it. (It\xc2\x92s a\nbutchered version of the Pledge of Allegiance of the United States for our foreign\nfriends.) The champagne is here. (The waiter is delivering it and pouring two glasses.) '
Monica	 Are you okay?'
Chandler	 Yes! Yes! I\xc2\x92m good! Are you good? Are you good? Is\neverything\xc2\x97are you\xc2\x97are you perrr-perfect?!'
Monica	 Yeah. I\xc2\x92m okay. I\xc2\x92m actually\xc2\x97I\xc2\x92m a little cold, can\nI have your jacket?'
Chandler	 Oh, yeah. (Starts to take it off and then realizes) Uh, no you\ncan\xc2\x92t have my jacket! Because then I would be cold! If you thought that you were\ngoing to be cold, you should\xc2\x92ve brought your own jacket. But uh, other than that, are\nyou okay? Are you okay?'
Monica	 (laughs) Are you sure you\xc2\x92re okay?'
Chandler	 Yes! I\xc2\x92m fine. In fact I\xc2\x92ve been fine for a long time now\nand I think, the reason is you.'
Monica	 Ohh that\xc2\x92s sweet!'
Chandler	 Okay umm, before I meant you I had really little life and I\ncouldn\xc2\x92t imagine growing old with\xc2\x85'
Monica	 (interrupting him) Oh my God!'
Chandler	 (not knowing the true meaning of her exclamation) I know, but just let\nme say it.'
Monica	 Oh my God, Richard. (Yep, Richard\xc2\x92s back.)'
Chandler	 What?! I\xc2\x92m Chandler! (She nods towards the doorway, Chandler\nturns and looks) Oh, that\xc2\x92s Richard!'
Monica	 Oh God, maybe he won\xc2\x92t see us. Richard!'
Richard	 (approaching them with a woman in tow) Monica! Chandler!'
Chandler	 Hey-hey, hey! (Gets up and hugs him.) I don\xc2\x92t know why I did\nthat!'
Monica	 Hey, it\xc2\x92s good to see you!'
Richard	 You too, you let uh, your hair grow long.'
Monica	 Yeah\xc2\x97Oh that\xc2\x92s right. You, you always wanted me too. Hey, I\nsee you got your mustache back.'
Richard	 Well, my nose got lonely.'
Chandler	 (to Richard\xc2\x92s date) And uh, you don\xc2\x92t have a mustache which\nis good. (She just smiles.) I\xc2\x92m Chandler; I make jokes when I\xc2\x92m uncomfortable.'
Chandler	 Hi.'
Richard	 Oh, I\xc2\x92m sorry. (Introduces them.) Lisa, (nodding at each) Monica,\nChandler. We used to date.'
Chandler	 Richard! No one supposed to know about us! (Richard just smiles at\nhim.) See I, did it again.'
Monica	 Chandler, wh-why don\xc2\x92t we sit down?'
Chandler	 Yeah, I\xc2\x92ll sit down. (He slides back into his chair.)'
Monica	 (to Richard) It\xc2\x92s good to see you'
Matire'd	 (to Richard) You\xc2\x92re table\xc2\x92s ready sir."
Richard	 Oh. Good to see you guys.'
Chandler	 Yes. (Thinking he\xc2\x92s gone.)'
Matire'd	 (motioning to the empty table next to Monica and Chandler\xc2\x92s) Or\nif you prefer, this table is available."
Richard	 That might be fun. (Richard and Lisa sit down.)'

Rachel	 What were you thinking?!'
Joey	 I didn\xc2\x92t know it was an auction!'
Rachel	 Wh?!'
Joey	 I figured, take a guess, help a charity, free boat!'
Rachel	 Why would a charity give away a free boat?!'
Joey	 I don\xc2\x92t know! Charity?'
Rachel	 Ugh!'
Phoebe	 Well, just buy the damn boat! (She\xc2\x92s still working her way through\nher tray of booze.)'
Rachel	 Phoebe, don\xc2\x92t you think you\xc2\x92ve had enough to drink?'
Phoebe	 I\xc2\x92m just helping the kids!'
Rachel	 How is you drinking helping the kids?'
Phoebe	 Because the more I drink, the less there is for the kids to drink.'
Mr. Thompson	 (approaching) Mr. Tribbiani.'
Joey	 Oh hi!'
Mr. Thompson	 Your generous contribution brings us a big step closer to building\nthe youth center.'
Joey	 Just out of curiosity, how-how much is that boat worth?'
Mr. Thompson	 I think it was valued at 19,000'
Joey	 (To Rachel) Hey, I was pretty close. (She just glares at him.) Uhh, so bad\nnews. Umm, I can\xc2\x92t buy the boat, I don\xc2\x92t have any money.'
Rachel	 Joey! Joey, good one! (Mr. Thompson starts to laugh.)'
Mr. Thompson	 That\xc2\x92s good. Very good! (Walks away.)'
Joey	 So uh listen, I think I\xc2\x92m gonna take off now. (Starts to get up.)'
Rachel	 (stopping him) Hey! You\xc2\x85can\xc2\x92t\xc2\x85leave Joey! You agreed to\nbuy that boat, all right?! That is a contract! And plus if you leave, my boss is gonna\nkill me!'
Joey	 Well, what am I gonna do Rach?! I don\xc2\x92t have that kind of money!'
Rachel	 I know. Okay. (Whispering and thinking.) Okay. Okay. All right. All\nright, this is what we\xc2\x92re gonna do, we are gonna go to the next highest bidder, and\nwe are just gonna let them buy it, and then you\xc2\x92re just gonna pay the difference.'
Joey	 Okay.'
Rachel	 Okay.'
Joey	 Look, I don\xc2\x92t know why the kids need a youth center anyway!\nY\xc2\x92know? They should just watch TV after school like I did and I turned out fine!'
Rachel	 Not great.'
Monica	 And so, we\xc2\x92re hiding in the bathroom.'
Richard	 And-and then I sneak out and before Monica can her parents come in.'
Monica	 So I hide in the shower and the next thing you know they\xc2\x92re going\nat it right on the bathroom floor.'
Lisa	 (laughing) Oh my God!'
Chandler	 I got a good one, I got a good one! I once walked in on both my\nparents making love to the same guy.'
Richard	 It\xc2\x92s so great seeing you guys again. I\xc2\x92d like to make a\ntoast. (Everyone raises their glasses) Uh, as a poet once said, "In the sweetness of\nfriendship, let there be laughter and sharing of pleasures for in the due of little things\nthe heart finds it\xc2\x92s morning and is refreshed."'
Monica	 Ohh.'
Chandler	 What?!'
Ross	 Oh my God, you guys!! (He\xc2\x92s excited about what he thought happened.)'
Chandler	 (stopping him from going any further) Before you say anything, have we\ngot a story for you! Guess who we bumped into at dinner!'
Ross	 Who?'
Chandler	 Richard!'
Ross	 What? (Excited) A-ohh! (Realizes) Ohh. Oh that\xc2\x92s right that\xc2\x92s\nright. That\xc2\x92s Richard\xc2\x92s favorite place too.'
Chandler	 Oh you knew that. Good!'
Monica	 I thought you were going out with Elizabeth.'
Ross	 Yeah, I was but uh, she was a little busy with a water balloon fight.'
Monica	 Oh Ross, sometimes grown-ups have commitments they just can\xc2\x92t get\nout of!'
Ross	 Y\xc2\x92know, maybe she is too young for me. Y\xc2\x92know, when I was over\nthere and she was running around with her friends, I felt like I was a baby-sitter. I\nfinally started to see what you guys were talking about. I don\xc2\x92t know what to do.'
Monica	 Why don\xc2\x92t you just weigh out the good stuff about the relationship\nagainst the bad stuff. I mean that\xc2\x92s what I did when I first (looks at Chandler and\npauses) weighing stuff.'
Ross	 Okay umm, bad stuff. Well, I\xc2\x92m-I\xc2\x92m 12 years older than she is.'
Monica	 If the school finds out you\xc2\x92re fired.'
Ross	 Hmm.'
Monica	 She\xc2\x92s leaving for three months.'
Chandler	 For camp!'
Ross	 Okay, good stuff. Umm, well she\xc2\x92s-she\xc2\x92s sweet and pretty\nand\xc2\x85'
Monica	 Look Ross, the only question you need to ask is, "Do you see a\nfuture?" I mean like do you see yourself marrying her? (Ross pauses in\nconsideration.) Oh my God! You did it already! You married her, didn\xc2\x92t you?!'
Ross	 No! No! I\xc2\x85didn\xc2\x92t do that. It\xc2\x92s just\xc2\x85 Okay, honestly\nno. I don\xc2\x92t, I don\xc2\x92t see a big future with her.'
Monica	 Okay well I think\xc2\x85that\xc2\x92s your answer.'
Ross	 I\xc2\x92ve got to talk to her. Ugh, I hate this part.'
Chandler	 Hey, you have to forget about Elizabeth. I mean if you\xc2\x92re not\ncareful you may not get married at all this year!'
Joey	 Rach! Rachel! Okay, the next highest bidder is at table one.'
Rachel	 Oh great!'
Joey	 (To Phoebe) Oh and uh the guy who got the Paris trip is at table four.'
Phoebe	 Oh, okay.'
Rachel	 (To Phoebe) Why do you care about the guy who won the Paris trip?'
Phoebe	 It\xc2\x92s a trip for two! (She gets up and takes off her blouse-type\nthingy she\xc2\x92s wearing over her dress.) Excuse me. (She walks over to table four.)\nExcuse me, is the person who won the Paris trip at this table?'
Emil Alexander	 That was me.'
Phoebe	 Oh, en chante. (She holds out her hand for him to kiss it, but he only\nshakes it.) '
Joey	 Uhh, excuse me is there a Mr. Bowmont at this table?'
Mr. Bowmont	 That\xc2\x92s me.'
Joey	 Ahh, yes. (Pushes Rachel in front of himself so that she could do the\ntalking.)'
Rachel	 Oh well, hello. This is your lucky day Mr. Bowmont, the uh gentleman day\nsailer as just become available again and I believe that you made a bid of $18,000.'
Joey	 You-you have to pay that! It\xc2\x92s not just a guess.'
Rachel	 (To Joey) Okay. Okay. (Shushes him.)'
Mr. Bowmont	 I was actually relieved uh I didn\xc2\x92t win the boat. My wife\nwould\xc2\x92ve killed me.'
Rachel	 Ohh\xc2\x85'
Joey	 Are you kidding me?! She\xc2\x92s gonna this boat!'
Rachel	 Y-Yeah! What-what is your wife\xc2\x92s name?'
Mr. Bowmont	 It\xc2\x92s Pam.'
Rachel	 Pam! Oh God okay, just imagine this, "The Pam."'
Joey	 Aw-awww!'
Mr. Bowmont	 I don\xc2\x92t think she\xc2\x92d like that.'
Rachel	 Okay, uh-uh imagine this, "The Mr. Bowmont."'
Joey	 Oooooh\xc2\x85'
Mr. Bowmont	 I don\xc2\x92t think so dear.'
Rachel	 Okay look, let me paint you a little picture. (She sits down next to\nhim.) All right, you are settin\xc2\x92 sail up the Hudson! You\xc2\x92ve got the wind in your\nh\xc2\x97(sees that he\xc2\x92s bald)\xc2\x97arms! You-you get all that peace and quiet that\nyou\xc2\x92ve always wanted! You get back to nature! You can go fishin\xc2\x92! You\ncan\xc2\x97ooh, you can get one of those little hats and have people call you captain, and\nthen when you\xc2\x92re old, Cappy.'
Mr. Bowmont	 What the hell, it\xc2\x92s for a good cause! All right!'
Joey	 No way! It\xc2\x92s mine!!'
Rachel	 (To Joey) What?! What?!'
Joey	 All that stuff you just said? I want that!'
Rachel	 But Joey you don\xc2\x92t have $20,000!'
Joey	 Who cares?! I-I\xc2\x92ll make payments, whatever it takes, I want the Mr.\nBowmont!!'
Joey	 Oh my God, you\xc2\x92re back!'
Phoebe	 Ohh, let me see it! Let me see your hand! (Chandler is frantically\ntrying to wave them off.)'
Monica	 Why do you want to see my hand?'
Phoebe	 I wanna see what\xc2\x92s in your hand. I wanna see the trash. '
Joey	 Yeah.'
Phoebe	 Eww! Oh, it\xc2\x92s all dirty. You should throw this out.'
Monica	 (suspiciously) Okay. (Exits to carry out Phoebe\xc2\x92s wishes.)'
Chandler	 (after the door closes) What did you guys just do?!'
Phoebe	 What happened?'
Chandler	 Richard was there so I couldn\xc2\x92t do it!'
Joey	 What?! Noooo\xc2\x85 (Phoebe gasps.)'
Chandler	 I\xc2\x92m gonna do it tomorrow y\xc2\x92know, and-and surprise her, but\nnow you\xc2\x92ve ruined it!'
Joey	 We didn\xc2\x92t ruin it!'
Chandler	 Who walks into a room and asks to see a person\xc2\x92s hands?!'
Phoebe	 Well, a palm reader, a manicurist, a hand doctor\xc2\x85'
Joey	 Glove salesman!'
Phoebe	 Good one! Yeah.'
Chandler	 This is terrible. What am I going to do?'
Phoebe	 Look, she only suspects something okay? She doesn\xc2\x92t know for sure,\nso just throw her off the track.'
Chandler	 That\xc2\x92s right, I can throw her off. I can make her think marriage\nis the last thing on my mind.'
Phoebe	 Yeah! Yeah! Convince her that-that you\xc2\x92re scared of commitment!\nConvince her that you\xc2\x92re a little coward!'
Chandler	 I can do that, I\xc2\x92ve had 30 years of practice.'
Joey	 Hey, being you is finally gonna pay off! (They give each other fives.)'
Monica	 (entering) I had to go all the way to the basement because some idiot\nkeeps stuffing the trash chute with pizza boxes!'
Joey	 That guy\xc2\x92s still doing that?!'
Rachel	 (entering) Hey! (Sees Monica, gasps, and runs over to her.) Oh my God\nyou\xc2\x92re here, let me see your hand!!'
Phoebe	 No, you\xc2\x92re too late!!! She already took out the trash!!!'
Ross	 (in his head) Wow! I have never had such a healthy break-up! She was\nsuch a grown-up about it! She didn\xc2\x92t seem too immature for me! Did I just make a huge\nmistake?'
Elizabeth	 (sticking her head out her window) Ross! Wait!'
Ross	 Elizabeth, thank God! I was just thinking about\xc2\x85'
Elizabeth	 You suck!! '
Ross	 What?!'
Ross	 Okay, break-up\xc2\x92s still on!'
Chandler	 Okay, okay, here she comes! (Sits on the couch next to him.) How do I\nlook? Do I look like a guy who doesn\xc2\x92t want to get married?'
Joey	 Yeah! And also, a little like a French guy. (They both squint at each\nother.) I never noticed that before.'
Monica	 (entering) Hi guys!'
Joey	 Hey!'
Chandler	 Hey!'
Monica	 What are you up too?'
Chandler	 Oh, just hanging out, talkin\xc2\x92 about uh, websites. (Joey laughs.)\nYeah, we saw this really interesting website about marriage and how totally unnecessary it\nis and how its just a way for the government to keep tabs on you.'
Joey	 (laughs) Yeah, Big Brother.'
Monica	 Well that\xc2\x92s a little crazy. Although I am y\xc2\x92know glad to hear\nthat you\xc2\x92re branching out on what you look at on the Internet.'
Chandler	 Yeah, well\xc2\x85 Y\xc2\x92know, it just got me thinking though, why\nwould anybody ever want to get married huh?'
Monica	 Why?! To celebrate your relationship! To solidify your commitment! To\ndeclare your love for one another to the world!'
Chandler	 Eh\xc2\x85'
Monica	 Okay well that\xc2\x92s good to know.'
Joey	 (all excited) The Mr. Bowmont\xc2\x92s here!!! (Jumps over the back off the\ncouch and runs out into the street.)'
Waitress	 Hey Monica, there\xc2\x92s a customer who wants to complement the chef,\nshould I let him in?'
Monica	 Sure, I love this part! (Starts to look busy.)'
Waitress	 (to the customer) Come on in.'
Richard	 Hi!'
Monica	 Richard!'
Richard	 Actually, I\xc2\x92m not here to complement the chef.'
Monica	 Ohh\xc2\x85 Oh, that\xc2\x92s okay I hate when people come back to\ncomplement the chef. Like I have nothing better to do! So what\xc2\x92s up?'
Richard	 Well, it was great seeing you the other night.'
Monica	 Oh, good to see you too. Did you come down here to tell me that?'
Richard	 No! I came here to tell you something else. (Pause) I came here (Pause)\nto tell you I still love you.'

Monica	 What uh\xc2\x97What did you\xc2\x97What?!'
Richard	 I still love you. And I know I probably shouldn\xc2\x92t even be here\ntelling you this, I mean you\xc2\x92re with Chandler a guy I really like, and if you say\nhe\xc2\x92s straight I\xc2\x92ll believe you! After seeing ya the other night I knew if I\ndidn\xc2\x92t tell ya I\xc2\x92d regret it for the rest of my life. Letting you go was the\nstupidest thing I ever did.'
Monica	 Y\xc2\x92know you\xc2\x92re really not supposed to be back here!'
Richard	 Well yeah, I\xc2\x92m sorry. I know this is the wrong time and the wrong\nplace but I had to tell ya! I wanna spend my life with you. I wanna marry you. I wanna\nhave kids with you.'
Monica	 Oh God\xc2\x85 (Starts looking around.) Why don\xc2\x92t they put chairs\nback here?!'
Richard	 I know this is crazy but am I too late?'
Monica	 What the\xc2\x85 Yes you\xc2\x92re too late! Where was all this three years\nago?!'
Richard	 Well I know I was an idiot! And I tried to forget you, I really did!\nY\xc2\x92know after we had lunch last year I spent six months in Africa trying to get\nyou out of my head!'
Monica	 What were you doing in Africa?'
Richard	 Working with blind kids.'
Monica	 Ohhh! What are you doing to me?! Oh look, I-I\xc2\x85 I\xc2\x92m sorry but\numm, this-this-this-this is not going to happen.'
Richard	 Okay that\xc2\x92s fine, I\xc2\x92ll walk away. And I\xc2\x92ll never bother\nyou again, but only if you tell me Chandler\xc2\x92s willing to give you everything I\nam.'
Monica	 Well he is! Yeah, I mean marriage is all he talks about! My goodness, in\nfact, I\xc2\x92m the one that\xc2\x92s making him wait!'
Richard	 You are?'
Monica	 Yeah!'
Richard	 Why?'
Monica	 Why? Because of the government.'
Rachel	 Isn\xc2\x92t it incredible?! Monica and Chandler, gettin\xc2\x92 married.'
Phoebe	 I know, they\xc2\x92re gonna be so happy together.'
Rachel	 Ohh\xc2\x85 I mean two best friends falling in love, how often does that\nhappen?'
Phoebe	 Not that often!'
Rachel	 No! I\xc2\x92m so happy for them!'
Phoebe	 Me too! So happy for them!'
Rachel	 I\xc2\x92m so happy and not at all jealous.'
Phoebe	 Oh no! No God, definitely not jealous!'
Rachel	 I mean I\xc2\x92m probably 98% happy, maybe 2% jealous. And I mean\nwhat\xc2\x92s 2%? That\xc2\x92s nothing.'
Phoebe	 Totally. I\xc2\x92m like 90/10.'
Rachel	 Yeah me too.'
Joey	 Hey uh, have you guys scene Chandler?'
Rachel	 (staring at him) Wh\xc2\x97no, but y\xc2\x92know who did stop in here\nlooking for ya, Tennille.'
Monica	 So that marriage stuff that you were saying yesterday, you don\xc2\x92t\nreally believe that do you?'
Chandler	 Sure I do. In fact, I think the whole concept of marriage is\nunnatural. I mean look at pigs. Let\xc2\x92s take a second here and look at pigs. Okay pigs\ndon\xc2\x92t mate for life. I mean a pig can have like a hundred sexual partners in a\nlifetime, and that\xc2\x92s just an ordinary pig not even a pig that\xc2\x92s good at sports!'
Monica	 Yeah, but that\xc2\x92s pigs not people!'
Chandler	 If marriage worked, I\xc2\x92d be all for it. But do you know what the\ndivorce rate in this country is? 97%.'
Monica	 Wait a minute. Are you honestly telling me that-that you may never\nwant to get married?'
Chandler	 Well, never say never but y\xc2\x92know probably uh yeah, never.'
Monica	 Oh my God! Then-then-then what are we even doing?! What is this?!'
Chandler	 Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What is all this pressure?! Is this some new kind of\nstrategy? Why don\xc2\x92t you put down your copy of \xc2\x91The Rules\xc2\x92 huh mantrap?!'
Monica	 Y\xc2\x92know what?! I gotta go! Ugh! '
Chandler	 (to them) It\xc2\x92s okay, I got a plan.'
Rachel	 We\xc2\x92re gonna find love!'
Phoebe	 Definitely!'
Rachel	 Yeah, I\xc2\x92m pretty confident about that. That\xc2\x92s what makes it so\neasy for me to be 80% happy for Monica and Chandler! It would be nice to have a little\nguarantee though.'
Phoebe	 What do you mean?'
Rachel	 Well y\xc2\x92know, some people make deals with a friend, like if neither\nof them are married by the time they\xc2\x92re 40, they marry each other.'
Phoebe	 You mean a backup?'
Rachel	 Exactly!'
Phoebe	 Yeah, yeah I got that.'
Rachel	 You do?'
Phoebe	 Hm-mmm.'
Rachel	 Who?'
Phoebe	 Joey.'
Rachel	 Joey?!'
Phoebe	 Yeah!'
Rachel	 Are you serious?!'
Phoebe	 Yeah, I locked him years ago!'
Rachel	 Wh\xc2\x85 So\xc2\x85 If neither of you are married by the time you\xc2\x92re\n40, you\xc2\x92re gonna marry Joey.'
Phoebe	 Yep, we shook on it. Yeah but believe me that is not how he wanted to\nseal the deal.'
Rachel	 Oh, seriously?'
Phoebe	 Ohh, yeah. I think his exact words were\xc2\x85 (She makes two clicking\nsounds with her tongue and purrs.)'
Rachel	 Charming.'
Phoebe	 Well hey, it\xc2\x92s just a backup.'
Rachel	 Yeah.'
Joey	 Hey Monica!'
Monica	 Have you seen Rachel? Or a mirror?'
Joey	 This is for my boat, pretty cool huh?'
Monica	 Yeah, it\xc2\x92s great.'
Joey	 Whoa-whoa, what\xc2\x92s the matter?! Talk to the captain!'
Monica	 I\xc2\x92m just having one of those days where you realize you\xc2\x92re in\na dead-end relationship!'
Joey	 Chandler giving you a hard time huh?'
Monica	 It\xc2\x92s not like I want to get married tomorrow! It\xc2\x92s just that\nI-I\xc2\x92d like to believe that I\xc2\x92m in a relationship that\xc2\x92s actually going\nsomewhere, that I\xc2\x92m not just wasting my time!'
Joey	 Well, you know Chandler.'
Monica	 No I don\xc2\x92t know Chandler! Not anymore! It\xc2\x92s like it\xc2\x92s\nlike something\xc2\x92s changed.'
Joey	 Maybe you changed?'
Monica	 I didn\xc2\x92t change!'
Joey	 Maybe that\xc2\x92s the problem.'
Monica	 What?!'
Joey	 Chandler is a complex fellow, one who is unlikely to take a wife.'
Monica	 Is that some kind of boat talk?'
Joey	 I don\xc2\x92t know! (All excited) I haven\xc2\x92t totally decided how to\ntalk on my boat yet.'
Monica	 What does he think? Does he think I\xc2\x92m just gonna wait around for\nnothing?'
Joey	 Monica face it, Chandler is against marriage. And-and always will be!'
Monica	 (starts for the door) Well there\xc2\x92s some people who do want to marry\nme.'
Joey	 There are?'
Monica	 Yeah! Richard!'
Joey	 R-R-Richard said he wants to marry you?! (Monica nods yes.) And-and\nChandler\xc2\x92s tellin\xc2\x92 ya how much he hates marriage?!'
Monica	 That\xc2\x92s right.'
Joey	 Chandler loves marriage!!'
Monica	 You just told me that he hates marriage! That-that he\xc2\x92s a-a complex\nfellow who\xc2\x92s unlikely to take a wife! That-that he\xc2\x92s against marriage and always\nwill be!'
Joey	 You got that from what I said?!'
Ross	 What happened you guys?'
Ross	 Rach!'
Rachel	 Hey you!'
Ross	 Hey, come on in.'
Rachel	 Oh thank you. Hey y\xc2\x92know, I\xc2\x92m so sorry to hear about you and\nElizabeth.'
Ross	 Oh, thanks. Yeah, I really thought we\xc2\x92d be able to make it work, but\nuh, I guess it just wasn\xc2\x92t meant to be.'
Rachel	 Yeah, love. It\xc2\x92s a tricky business isn\xc2\x92t it?'
Ross	 I guess so.'
Rachel	 So what do you say we make a pact? If you and I are both single by the\ntime we\xc2\x92re 40, we get married. I mean, we know each other, we like each other, and\nwe\xc2\x92ve-we\xc2\x92ve already slept together so y\xc2\x92know there\xc2\x92ll be no surprises\nthere! You know what I mean? No like, "What\xc2\x92s that?!"'
Ross	 Right. Ohh! You-you want me to be your backup.'
Rachel	 Exactly.'
Ross	 Ohh, yeah I already have one.'
Rachel	 What? Who?'
Ross	 Phoebe.'
Rachel	 Phoebe?! Wait a\xc2\x97but-but she just, she said that Joey was her\nbackup.'
Ross	 Ohh, I don\xc2\x92t think so.'
Rachel	 Ross! I just had a conversation with her, and she said that she and Joey\nmade a deal!'
Ross	 That\xc2\x92s impossible! I mean we have had a deal for years!\nWe-we-we shook on it, although believe me she wanted to do a lot more than that.'
Joey	 Where the hell have you been?!'
Chandler	 I was making a coconut phone with the professor.'
Joey	 Richard told Monica he wants to marry her!'
Chandler	 What?!'
Joey	 Yeah! Yeah, I\xc2\x92ve been trying to find ya to tell to stop messing with\nher and maybe I would have if these (lifts a leg) damn boat shoes wouldn\xc2\x92t keep\nflying off!'
Chandler	 My\xc2\x97Oh my God!'
Joey	 I know! They suck!!'
Chandler	 He\xc2\x92s not supposed to ask my girlfriend to marry him! I\xc2\x92m\nsupposed to do that!'
Joey	 I know!'
Chandler	 Well what\xc2\x85 Y\xc2\x92know what I\xc2\x92m gonna do? I\xc2\x92m gonna go\nover there; I\xc2\x92m gonna kick his ass! (Pause) Will you help me?!'
Joey	 Look, Chandler I don\xc2\x92t think us getting our asses kicked is a\nsolution. Okay? Just go and find Monica!'
Chandler	 You\xc2\x92re right.'
Joey	 Yeah!'
Chandler	 Okay. (Starts running for the bedroom) I\xc2\x92m gonna get the ring!\nI\xc2\x92m gonna get the ring! (Does so) I\xc2\x92m gonna go find her and (starts running for\nthe door) I\xc2\x92m just going to propose!'
Joey	 Okay.'
Chandler	 Okay great.'
Joey	 Dude-dude-dude!'
Chandler	 What?!'
Joey	 Let me know about that coconut phone, it might great for the boat.'

Monica	 Hi.'
Richard	 Hi.'
Monica	 I don\xc2\x92t know why I\xc2\x92m here.'
Richard	 I didn\xc2\x92t ask. You wanna come in?'
Monica	 I don\xc2\x92t know.'
Richard	 Oh, okay. Well, I\xc2\x92ll just leave the door open and go sit on the\ncouch. (Does so.)'
Monica	 (entering) Chandler is such an idiot!'
Richard	 (standing up quickly) Drink?'
Monica	 Yeah, I\xc2\x92ll have a scotch\xc2\x85'
Richard	 \xc2\x85on the rocks with a twist? I remember. (Goes to make her drink.)'
Monica	 (moving over to the couch) Still smoking cigars?'
Richard	 Uh, no! No! That\xc2\x92s\xc2\x85art! If it bothers you I can put my art\nout.'
Monica	 No that\xc2\x92s, that\xc2\x92s okay.'
Richard	 So Monica let me ask you a question. Y\xc2\x92know, since we broke up do\nyou ever, think about me?'
Monica	 Uh yeah, I-I actually I thought about you a couple months ago.'
Richard	 Oh really?'
Monica	 Yeah but it was because I-I had an eye exam and I don\xc2\x92t like my new\neye doctor.'
Richard	 Who is it?'
Monica	 Edward Nevski?'
Richard	 Yeah he\xc2\x92s no good. Do you ever (pause) think about me in a (pause)\nnon-eye doctor way?'
Monica	 No.'
Richard	 Ahh.'
Monica	 But getting over was the hardest thing that I\xc2\x92ve ever had to do.\nAnd I never let myself think about you.'
Rachel	 Phoebe! You picked Joey and Ross?! You can not have two backups!'
Phoebe	 Of course I can! It\xc2\x92s just good sense to backup your backup! Look,\nI\xc2\x92ve already lost Chandler!'
Rachel	 What?!'
Joey	 (entering) Hey!'
Ross	 (entering) Hey!'
Joey	 Phoebe! We\xc2\x92re both (points at Ross and himself) your backup?!'
Ross	 Phoebe, how could you do this to me?!'
Phoebe	 I don\xc2\x92t\xc2\x97Look I don\xc2\x92t know what you\xc2\x92re complaining\nabout now? You were both aware of the situation!'
Joey	 No we weren\xc2\x92t!'
Ross	 I was not!'
Phoebe	 Okay, this kind of back talk is not gonna fly when we\xc2\x92re married!'
Rachel	 Phoebe you can\xc2\x92t have both of them! You have to pick one!'
Joey	 Pick me!!'
Ross	 No! Pick me! I don\xc2\x92t want to end up an old maid!'
Phoebe	 All right well let\xc2\x92s see, Ross is a good father, but Joey has a\nboat\xc2\x97This is hard!'
Joey	 This is crazy! Hey look, I wanna switch to Rachel!'
Ross	 Ooh, I wanna switch to Rachel too!'
Phoebe	 No wait! Just\xc2\x97Okay\xc2\x97Just wait! You guys! Wait you guys!\nDon\xc2\x92t make any rash decisions, okay? Just remember my promise, when we get married,\nthree times a week.'
Rachel	 Oh God, Phoebe!'
Phoebe	 (To Rachel) I\xc2\x92m talking about massages.'
Rachel	 Oh. '
Rachel	 Okay, y\xc2\x92know what?! I know-I know how to settle this! All right\nhere, this is what we\xc2\x92re gonna do! I\xc2\x92m gonna write Joey on one napkin (does so)\nand I\xc2\x92m gonna right Ross on the other napkin (does so) and we are going to pick one!\nAnd that person is going to be our backup! Okay?'
Joey	 Okay that\xc2\x92s fair.'
Ross	 All right.'
Phoebe	 Good!'
Rachel	 Pick one.'
Phoebe	 Left! (Rachel hands her the napkin in her left hand and they both unfold\nand read them.) Thank you.'
Rachel	 You\xc2\x92re welcome.'
Phoebe	 (reading) Ross!'
Rachel	 (reading) Joey! (Pause) We should just switch.'
Phoebe	 Yeah absolutely! (They both switch.)'
Joey	 Yeah.'
Monica	 (to the mask) I missed you-you ugly, flat faced old freak!'
Richard	 Excuse me?'
Monica	 Oh! (Laughs and points at the mask.) Him.'
Richard	 Oh. (Laughs.) Whew!'
Monica	 I missed this apartment! Now, this is a grown-up\xc2\x92s apartment!\nY\xc2\x92know, I-I should be with a grown-up, do you know what I mean?!'
Richard	 Yeah! You\xc2\x92re saying, you need to be with someone more mature.\nMaybe someone with, a license to practice medicine. Or a mustache.'
Monica	 Y\xc2\x92know, let\xc2\x92s face it, I\xc2\x92m not a kid anymore! I-I need to\nbe with someone who-who wants the same things that I do! I mean coming to my place of work\nand telling me that you love me, I want that! Talking about pig sex over lunch, I don\xc2\x92t\nwant that!'
Richard	 I think that\xc2\x92s fair.'
Monica	 Fair? Please don\xc2\x92t even talk to me about fair! Fair would\xc2\x92ve\nbeen you wanting to marry me back then! Or fair would\xc2\x92ve been Chandler wanting to\nmarry me now! Believe me, nothing about this is fair! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing!\nNothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing!'
Richard	 It\xc2\x92s okay! Shh! Hey. Hey. (Hugs her) Shhhh. '
Monica	 Nothing. (She backs away a little bit but is still in his arms and looks\nup at his eyes.) I don\xc2\x92t kn\xc2\x97Umm. I don\xc2\x92t know. Umm\xc2\x85'
Richard	 I know. (Backs away.)'
Monica	 Y\xc2\x92know, I-I\xc2\x85 I have to figure\xc2\x85some st\xc2\x97Y\xc2\x92know,\nsome stuff before I can\xc2\x85'
Richard	 Yeah, I understand. Take as much time as you want. (Pause) Ten, even\ntwenty minutes if you need it. I\xc2\x92ll be here. Not smoking. (Monica leaves.)'
Richard	 Chandler.'
Chandler	 Where is she? I\xc2\x92m not scared of you! (Averts his eyes and walks\nin.)'
Richard	 She\xc2\x92s not here and please come in.'
Chandler	 (examining the coffee table) Scotch on the rocks, with a twist, on a\ncoaster? Ha-ha, Monica! Monica!'
Richard	 Okay, she was here, but she left.'
Chandler	 Well where did she go?'
Richard	 Well she said she had to think things over.'
Chandler	 Oh my God, I can\xc2\x92t believe this! Y\xc2\x92know, I thought\xc2\x85I\nthought you were a good guy.'
Richard	 Oh, hey look nothing happened.'
Chandler	 Nothing happened? Nothing? So you didn\xc2\x92t tell my girlfriend that\nyou love her?'
Richard	 Well all right, one thing happened?'
Chandler	 Y\xc2\x92know what? I can\xc2\x92t believe this! Do you know what you did?\nMy girlfriend is out there thinking things over! You made my girlfriend think!!'
Richard	 Well I\xc2\x92m sorry.'
Chandler	 And what does she have to think about? I love her!'
Richard	 Well, apparently I\xc2\x92m willing to offer her things that you are not.'
Chandler	 But I am willing to offer her all those things. This was just a\nplan, y\xc2\x92know? A way to throw her off course so that when I offered her all these\nthings, she\xc2\x92d be surprised!'
Richard	 Well if it helps, it worked very well.'
Chandler	 It was working until you showed up, you big tree! I mean, this\nisn\xc2\x92t fair. You had your chance with her! You had your chance and you blew it! And\nthis is my chance and I am not going to blow it because we are meant for each\nother! And this is all just been one stupid mistake! (Sits down heavily.) I was gonna\npropose tonight.'
Richard	 You were gonna propose? (Sits on the arm of the couch.)'
Chandler	 Yeah I even (pause) got a ring. (Puts in on the center cushion.) Did\nyou get a ring?'
Richard	 No I don\xc2\x92t have a ring! (Pause) You go get her Chandler. (Pause)\nAnd can I give you a piece of advice? If you do get her, don\xc2\x92t let her go. Trust me.'
Chandler	 Y\xc2\x92know Richard\xc2\x85you are a good guy.'
Richard	 I know. (Pause) I hate that!'
Joey	 Dude!'
Chandler	 I can\xc2\x92t talk to you now, I gotta find Monica!'
Joey	 She\xc2\x92s gone.'
Chandler	 What?'
Joey	 She\xc2\x92s gone. She had a bag and she left.'
Chandler	 What are you talking about?'
Joey	 She was all crying. She-she said you guys want different things, and that\nand that she needed time to think.'
Chandler	 Well why didn\xc2\x92t you stop her?! Why didn\xc2\x92t you just tell her\nit was a plan?!'
Joey	 I-I did! I told her everything, Chandler! But she wouldn\xc2\x92t believe\nme.'
Chandler	 Well where\xc2\x85 Where did she go?'
Joey	 To her parent\xc2\x92s I think and she said you shouldn\xc2\x92t call her. But\nif I were you I would.'
Chandler	 I can\xc2\x92t believe I ruined this.'
Joey	 I am so sorry man.'
Monica	 You wanted it to be a surprise.'
Chandler	 Oh my God.'
Monica	 Chandler\xc2\x85 In all my life\xc2\x85 I never thought I would be so lucky.\n(Starting to cry.) As to\xc2\x85fall in love with my best\xc2\x85my best\xc2\x85 There\xc2\x92s a\nreason why girls don\xc2\x92t do this!'
Chandler	 Okay! (He joins her on one knee) Okay! Okay! Oh God, I thought\xc2\x85\n(Starting to cry, pauses) Wait a minute, I-I can do this. (Pause) I thought that it\nmattered what I said or where I said it. Then I realized the only thing that matters is\nthat you, (Pause) you make me happier than I ever thought I could be. (Starting to cry\nagain.) And if you\xc2\x92ll let me, I will spend the rest of my life trying to make you\nfeel the same way. (Pause as he gets out the ring.) Monica, will you marry me?'
Monica	 Yes.'
Monica	 I knew you were likely to take a wife!'
Joey	 (yelling through the door) Can we come it yet?! We\xc2\x92re dying out here!'
Monica	 Come in! Come in! (Joey, Rachel, and Phoebe burst through the door.)\nWe\xc2\x92re engaged!!!'
Rachel	 Ohhh, this is the least jealous I\xc2\x92ve ever been!'
Phoebe	 Oh no wait no, this is wrong! Ross isn\xc2\x92t here!'
Monica	 Oh\xc2\x85'
Rachel	 Oh hell, he\xc2\x92s done this three times! He knows what its about!'
Joey	 Yeah!'
