Chandler	 Let me ask you, why is everybody using these tiny lights nowadays? I\nremember when people used to use big lights.'
Rachel	 That\xc2\x92s a good story, Grandpa.'
Ross	 Hey'
All	 Hey'
Ross	 Wow, Monica\xc2\x92s letting other people help decorate her tree! Did\nsomeone get her drunk again or?'
Monica	 Having a perfectly decorated tree is not what Christmas is about.\nIt\xc2\x92s about being with the people that you love.'
Phoebe	 That is nice and we\xc2\x92re done. TADA!'
Chandler	 I dunno what it is, it just doesn\xc2\x92t quite feel like Christmas to\nme.'
Monica	 Oh, here.'
Chandler	 See now it feels like Christmas!'

Ross	 \xc2\x85 and that\xc2\x92s the story of the dreidle. Now, some people\ntrace the Christmas tree back to the Egyptians, who used to bring green palm branches into\ntheir huts on the shortest day of the year, symbolising life\xc2\x92s triumph over death.\nAnd that was like 4000 years ago.'
Rachel	 So, pretty much around the same time that you started telling this\nstory.'
Joey	 Hey you guys.'
Chandler	 Hey Joe what\xc2\x92s up?'
Joey	 I had to get out of the apartment. Janine is like stretching all over the\nplace. Y\xc2\x92know, everywhere I look she\xc2\x92s like\xc2\x85 (He imitates her stretching)'
Chandler	 I can see why that\xc2\x92s hard to resist.'
Joey	 I like her so much!'
Monica	 Aw, I\xc2\x92m sorry sweetie that she doesn\xc2\x92t feel the same way.'
Joey	 I know. And she\xc2\x92s so sweet. I just wanna feed her grapes and brush\nher hair.'
Chandler	 You are aware that she\xc2\x92s not a monkey, right?'
Ross	 I am so over Janine. I mean, yeah, at first I thought she was hot,\nbut now she\xc2\x92s like OLD NEWS!'
Janine	 Hey guys!'
Ross	 Hi Janine!'
Janine	 I just got a call to be a dancer on a television special for New\nYear\xc2\x92s Eve. It\xc2\x92s called some sort of Dick\xc2\x92n Rock\xc2\x92n Dickie Eve.'
Monica	 Hold it! Are you talking about Dick Clark\xc2\x92s New Year\xc2\x92s\nRocking Eve?'
Janine	 Yeah, that\xc2\x92s what I said.'
Monica	 Oh my God! We love that show! I mean Ross and I have been watching it\nsince I can remember!'
Chandler	 Ah, you\xc2\x92re still just a little fat girl inside aren\xc2\x92t you?\n(He kisses her on the cheek)'
Janine	 Well I\xc2\x92m gonna be on it this year. I\xc2\x92m gonna be one of the\nparty people.'
Ross	 You\xc2\x92re gonna be a party person! Those guys rock the most!'
Janine	 Well they said I should bring someone. (To Joey) Do you wanna be my\ndance partner?'
Joey	 Totally! I would love to spend New Year\xc2\x92s with you.'
Janine	 Well actually they\xc2\x92re taping tomorrow. I don\xc2\x92t really\nunderstand why.'
Ross	 Oh, well you see how it works is, the part with Dick Clark in Times\nSquare is actually live, but they tape some of the party stuff ahead of time. Yeah, not a\nlot of people know that.'
Janine	 Yeah well, do you guys wanna come too?'
Ross	 Are you serious?'
Monica	 We are there!'
Chandler	 What, what are you laughing at?'
Rachel	 Well, I used to date him, but you\xc2\x92re still going out with her!'
Janine	 Thanks. (To Monica and Ross) Great so we can all go together! I gotta\nrun. Catch you later!'
All	 Bye!'
Ross	 Bye Janine!'
Joey	 Did she just ask me out on a date?'
Chandler	 I don\xc2\x92t think so.'
Monica	 What are you talking about? She just invited him to the biggest party of\nthe millennium!'
Rachel	 Yeah, but she also invited you and Ross. Yeah, honey, I\xc2\x92m sorry,\nbut I don\xc2\x92t think that was a romantic thing.'
Joey	 Oh. Maybe. But hey I know how I can find out. We\xc2\x92re going to a New\nYear\xc2\x92s Eve party, right? So at midnight, I can kiss her. And if she kisses me back,\ngreat! Y\xc2\x92know? But if she says \xc2\x91Dude, what the hell are you doing?\xc2\x92 I can\nsay \xc2\x91It wasn\xc2\x92t me, it was New Years!\xc2\x92'
Rachel	 Well, that\xc2\x92s a lot better than Ross trying to kiss me in High\nSchool, and saying that he did it because he needed chapstick.'
Ross	 It was a dry day.'
Monica	 We are going to Dick Clark\xc2\x92s New Year\xc2\x92s Rocking Eve!'
Ross	 Oh my God!'
Monica	 Oh my God!'
Chandler	 (To Rachel) Oh my God!'
Joey	 OK, listen I\xc2\x92ve been on sets before, so let me give you a little\nadvice, alright? It\xc2\x92s a show, but we\xc2\x92re just dancing, OK? It\xc2\x92s no big deal.\nThe important thing to remember \xc2\x96 stay cool.'
Ross	 Got it!'
Ross	 Oh my God it\xc2\x92s just like I dreamed it!'
Director	 OK, everyone gather up.'
Monica and Ross	 \xc2\x91Scuse us'
Director	 Here\xc2\x92s what\xc2\x92s gonna happen. The music\xc2\x92s gonna start,\nyou\xc2\x92re gonna dance, we\xc2\x92re gonna tape, you don\xc2\x92t look at the camera. Any\nquestions?'
Ross	 Yeah, I have a question. When is this gonna air?'
Director	 Uh, yeah. Now you guys dance over there, you guys over there, and I\nwant you two right around here, and everyone else spread out.'
Joey	 Ross! So when is it gonna air?'
Rachel	 Okay, you look in the kitchen, I will look in the back closet.'
Chandler	 I can save you time ladies, I\xc2\x92m right here.'
Phoebe	 Yeah, Chandler why don\xc2\x92t you take a walk? This doesn\xc2\x92t concern\nyou.'
Rachel	 We are looking for our Christmas presents from Monica.'
Chandler	 What? That\xc2\x92s terrible!'
Phoebe	 No-no, we do it every year!'
Chandler	 Oh well, that makes it not terrible.'
Phoebe	 No, yeah, we never find them! She\xc2\x92s always best at us that wily\nminx.'
Rachel	 Don\xc2\x92t worry, we\xc2\x92re just gonna search here for an hour, them\nwe\xc2\x92re gonna go over to Joey\xc2\x92s and search, OK?'
Chandler	 No not okay, you can\xc2\x92t look for Monica\xc2\x92s presents!'
Phoebe	 But we have to!'
Chandler	 No, you don\xc2\x92t have to, and you can\xc2\x92t because I live here\ntoo.'
Phoebe	 Well then, you should look with us.'
Chandler	 Why?'
Rachel	 Chandler, aren\xc2\x92t you worried about what to get Monica for\nChristmas?'
Chandler	 No, I have a great idea for a present for her.'
Phoebe	 Oh, that\xc2\x92s it? (Mimics Chandler) A great idea!'
Rachel	 Chandler, that\xc2\x92s not enough. I mean what if she gets you a great\npresent, two medium presents, and a bunch of little presents? And you\xc2\x92ve just gotten\nher one great present? I mean that\xc2\x92s just gonna make her feel bad. Why would you do\nthat to her Chandler? Why? Why?'
Chandler	 If I help, we can find \xc2\x91em faster!'
Rachel	 That\xc2\x92s right!'
Phoebe	 Ooh ooh, we have a live one!'
Rachel	 Oh, it\xc2\x92s a Macy\xc2\x92s bag!'
Phoebe	 Ooh, who\xc2\x92s it for?'
Rachel	 (Reading) Dear losers, do you really think I\xc2\x92d hide\npresents under the couch? P.S. Chandler, I knew they\xc2\x92d break you.'
Phoebe	 Uh-oh. She may be onto us.'
Rachel	 We are so gonna find them this year.'
Chandler	 Y\xc2\x92know when you guys said you were gonna go across the hall and\nlook, you don\xc2\x92t, you don\xc2\x92t do that every year do you?'
Rachel	 Yeah.'
Chandler	 You don\xc2\x92t, like go into the back of my closet, and look under my\ngym bag or anything?'
Phoebe and Rachel	 No, we never do that'
Chandler	 Because that\xc2\x92s where Joey gave me some stuff to store that\nI\xc2\x92ve never seen before in my life! Okay, that did not just happen! (He does a weird\nclicky motion with his fingers, that kinda hard to describe.)'
Monica	 Okay, here comes another camera.'
Ross	 Right. No biggie. Stay loose.'
Ross	 Why do they keep doing that?'
Monica	 If we wanna get on camera, I think we have to get up on one of those\nplatforms. They\xc2\x92ve been taping those people up there all day.'
Ross	 Right.'
Ross	 Hey, what\xc2\x92d you guys do to get up on there?'
Girl	 We learned how to dance.'
Monica	 Oh yeah? Well when you learned how to dance did you forget how to put on\nunderpants?'
Ross	 Yeah!'
Janine	 Hey! You\xc2\x92re a good dancer!'
Joey	 Really?'
Janine	 Yeah, well you\xc2\x92d be better if you just loosened your hips a little.'
Joey	 What do you mean?'
Janine	 Like this.'
Janine	 That\xc2\x92s it, feel the rhythm. That\xc2\x92s better.'
Joey	 Uh-huh.'
Director	 (To Joey) Okay, you\xc2\x92re dancing with that girl over there.'
Joey	 No-no-no-no-no we came together!'
Director	 I don\xc2\x92t see it. (To Janine) You are dancing with the tall guy\nover there. Tall guy, raise your hand! (He does. Janine goes over to him.)'
Joey	 No-no hey buddy, please let me dance with that girl, I really like her and\nI think I have a shot.'
Director	 Really, y\xc2\x92think so? I don\xc2\x92t..'

Chandler	 I couldn't find anything at Joey--Hey-hey, oh hey!"
Rachel	 Yeah, we found them. There were in the guest room closet behind some\ncoats.'
Phoebe	 Yeah, and you have nothing to worry about 'cos they're all crap!"
Chandler	 Those are my gifts, I got them for you.'
Phoebe	 Ohhh. Thanks Chandler they're great!"
Rachel	 Well Chandler, what is this very weird, metal A Z thing?'
Chandler	 Those are book ends! That's a great gift!"
Phoebe	 Oh, okay, I'm sorry, thank you for my azzz. "
Rachel	 Ha!'
Chandler	 Make sure you put all that stuff back in the closet, okay?'
Rachel	 Yes, okay, oh, by the way, I just gotta say, I think it's really nice of\nyou that even after you've moved, you still keep storing that stuff for Joey!"
Joey	 Hey-hey dancer girl! Can I go to the bathroom? I just.. (The girl starts\ndancing really close to him, so he picks her up, twirls her round, and puts her against a\nplatform) Here we go. (He walks away to find Monica and Ross doing a really out of place\ndance) Looking good Gellers!'
Ross	 We know!'
Monica	 Hey, see that snippy guy over there? He\xc2\x92s the one who decides who\ngets up on the platform. We should go dance by him.'
Ross	 Okay.'
Director	 Okay, everybody hold!'
Director	 Next on the platforms are\xc2\x85 (He points to the right of Ross and\nMonica, so they dance over to where he\xc2\x92s pointing to. He points away from them)\n\xc2\x85you two! And\xc2\x85 (He points the other way, and Ross and Monica follow his arm.\nAgain he points away.) \xc2\x85You two!'
Monica	 Excuse me, sir, would it help if I weren\xc2\x92t wearing underpants?'
Ross	 Monica! (Pause) Would it?'
Joey	 Hey! Tall guy! Hey, listen, I wanted to talk to you about that girl that\nyou\xc2\x92re dancing with.'
Tall Guy	 She\xc2\x92s nice, huh? To think I almost brought my wife to\nthis!'
Joey	 Yeah, yeah, okay. Uh, look buddy, I came with that girl, and I had this\nplan to kiss her at the new years countdown \xc2\x96 I\xc2\x92m trying to win her over, so I\nwas wondering if..'
Tall Guy	 No I don\xc2\x92t think so.'
Joey	 Oh come on man, you can dance with my partner, she\xc2\x92s real, uh,\nmellow!'
Tall Guy	 Look, are you dating this girl you came with?'
Joey	 Well, I was hoping after tonight that maybe I could you know\xc2\x85'
Tall Guy	 No, no. She\xc2\x92s fair game if you ask me, sorry buddy!'
Joey	 Alright, alright, hey y\xc2\x92know fair is fair, (he pretends to wash his\nhands) if you\xc2\x92re right, you\xc2\x92re right, what can I say, but hey oh no! (He throws\nwater on the guy\xc2\x92s pants)'
Tall Guy	 God! What are you, in second grade?'
Joey	 Hey, now you\xc2\x92re the one who wet his pants. (He throws another handful\non him and runs out)'
Monica	 Man, this sucks! Y\xc2\x92know if Mom and Dad don\xc2\x92t see us on TV\nafter we made them so jealous, I mean, who\xc2\x92s gonna be the losers then?'
Ross	 Hey, I know what\xc2\x92ll get us up on a platform!'
Monica	 What?'
Ross	 The routine!'
Monica	 Ross, we haven\xc2\x92t done the routine since middle school.'
Ross	 Hey, when the snippy guy sees the routine, he\xc2\x92ll wanna build\nus our own platform!'
Monica	 Was it really that good?'
Ross	 We got honourable mention in the brother/sister dance category!\nLook, it\xc2\x92s almost fake midnight, do we really have any other choice?'
Monica	 Okay, let\xc2\x92s do it. Mom and Dad are gonna be so faced!'
Monica	 5 6 7 8!'
Ross	 So, do we really have to ask who\xc2\x92s going up on the platform\nnext?'
Director	 Oh no! You get up there and do that again exactly like that!'
Monica	 Yes! (They run over to a platform)'
Director	 (To Cameraman) Make sure you get this, they\xc2\x92re gonna want it for\nthe bloopers show. (To everyone) Alright cut! Listen up everyone, when we start again\nit\xc2\x92s gonna be the countdown to new years, so I wanna see everybody\xc2\x92s excitement.'
Tall Guy	 Hey, pal, you have about three seconds to get away from my\npartner.'
Director	 What\xc2\x92s going on over here?'
Joey	 Uh, take a look at the guy\xc2\x92s pants! I mean, I know you told us to\nshow excitement, but don\xc2\x92t you think he went a little overboard?'
Director	 What\xc2\x92s the matter with you? Get out of here!'
Joey	 Yeah, take a hike wetpants!'
Ross	 Can you believe this? We\xc2\x92re gonna be on the platform for the\nMillennium moment!'
Monica	 I know! Hey, you haven\xc2\x92t been practising the routine, have you?'
Ross	 No!'
Monica	 Me too!'
Ross	 Hey, when the music starts up again, I was thinking of maybe goind\ninto the robot, y\xc2\x92know? (He mimics a robot)'
Monica	 Ross, I think we should stick to the routine, we don\xc2\x92t wanna look\nstupid!'
Director	 Alright we\xc2\x92re back! Ten seconds left here we go! Ten! Nine!\nEight! Seven! (He continues to count as we hear Joey think)'
Joey\xc2\x92s Head	 Okay, it all comes down to this. Whatever happens,\nhappens. Destiny.'
All	 Three, Two, One!'
Director	 Cut!'
Joey	 No! Year! Happy No Year!'
Director	 Okay, here\xc2\x92s where we go to the live shot of Times Square, nice\nwork everyone that\xc2\x92s a wrap!'
Phoebe	 Hey! Look who I found!'
Chandler	 Oh, hey guys!'
Phoebe	 Y\xc2\x92know, birds have a very good sense of direction, and I thought\nmaybe they could help us find where the presents are hidden.'
Chandler	 Yes, if the presents are hidden south for the winter.'
Phoebe	 Or we could just follow your clever jokes \xc2\x96 any ideas? No!\nDidn\xc2\x92t think so! Okay, c\xc2\x92mon guys, show us where the presents are!'
Chandler	 Oh, the duck seems to think that Monica got me garbage! Hmm, I wonder\nwhat I could get Monica that\xc2\x92s as good as garbage?'
Phoebe	 Hmm, how about my azzz?'
Rachel	 Hey, this is hollow.'
Phoebe	 What?'
Rachel	 This bench, it\xc2\x92s hollow! I can\xc2\x92t believe I never knew that!\n(She pushes all the pillows off it and opens it up) Oh, the presents!!!'
Phoebe	 No, don\xc2\x92t look directly at them!'
Chandler	 What?'
Phoebe	 Alright, no, we could look at them!'
Rachel	 Oh, this one\xc2\x92s for me!'
Phoebe	 Oh, this one\xc2\x92s for Chandler. Here.'
Chandler	 Oh great!'
Phoebe	 And the big one\xc2\x92s for me!'
Rachel	 Ooh, let\xc2\x92s open them!'
Chandler	 Okay! Okay! Okay!'
Phoebe	 Hee hee!'
Chandler	 Wait, we can\xc2\x92t do this.'
Phoebe and Rachel	 Why?'
Chandler	 I don\xc2\x92t wanna know what Monica got me. Y\xc2\x92know? I mean, look,\nI\xc2\x92m sure she worked really hard at getting you a present, and wanting to surprise me,\nand you guys are gonna ruin that, and I, look we have to put these back, this is not what\nChristmas is about.'
Rachel	 Whatever Linus, I\xc2\x92m opening mine.'
Chandler	 Nobody is opening anything ok? Look, I don\xc2\x92t know about you guys,\nbut I wanna see the look on Monica\xc2\x92s face when I give her my present, and I\xc2\x92m\nsure she wants to see the look on my face when I get mine. So please, please, can we just,\ncan we put them back?'
Phoebe	 Will you get us better gifts?'
Chandler	 Fine!'
Monica	 Hey guys! You found the presents? Chandler, you let them find the\npresents? Great! Do you know how long it took me to find you that water purifier?'
Chandler	 That\xc2\x92s what you got me?'
Phoebe	 Oh yes, I see what you mean. That look is priceless.'
Joey	 Home sweet home, huh? Nice to, uh, get back to reality. Plus we know how\nthe New Year\xc2\x92s gonna go off. I guess there\xc2\x92s no reason for all that Y2K panic,\ny\xc2\x92know? Anyway, g\xc2\x92night!'
Janine	 Joey.'
Joey	 Yeah?'
Janine	 (She takes his hands) 3, 2, 1. (She kisses him) Happy New Year.'
Joey	 Oh, yoii. What was that for?'
Janine	 Well, I don\xc2\x92t know tonight when they yelled cut and we didn\xc2\x92t\nget to kiss, I was really, really, disappointed, and I just, really wanted to kiss you'
Joey	 Really? In the moment, I really wanted to kiss you too. In the moment.'
Janine	 In the moment, yeah.'
Joey	 But only in the moment. So do ya wanna kiss again?'
Janine	 Sure, New Year\xc2\x92s Eve is only two weeks away. Can you wait?'
Joey	 No.'
Janine	 Me neither.'
Joey	 3, 2, '
Janine	 Joey, you don\xc2\x92t have to count down every time we kiss.'
Joey	 Uh, yeah, okay. Except I sorta felt like I needed a couple of seconds to\nget ready.'

Monica	 We were on the platform, ready to dance the world into the new\nMillennium, and the guy yelled \xc2\x91CUT!\xc2\x92'
Rachel	 Uh, wait, so you guys are telling me you actually did the routine from\neighth grade?'
Monica	 Yeah. But of course we had to update it a little bit. (To Ross) Hey, by\nthe way, great thinking about catching me!'
Rachel	 \xc2\x91Cos I was gonna say there\xc2\x92s no way you could\xc2\x92ve done the\nend the way you guys did it back then!'
Monica	 What? We could do it!'
Ross	 I don\xc2\x92t know, I mean you were a lot bigger, I mean, stronger\nback then.'
Monica	 I can do it, okay? Come on, let\xc2\x92s go. (She and Ross get up)'
Monica and Ross	 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 (Ross runs to be caught by\nMonica, but she moves out of the way)'
Monica	 I can\xc2\x92t do it! (Ross falls into Monica\xc2\x92s room)'
Chandler	 Now you do that, you\xc2\x92re on TV.'
