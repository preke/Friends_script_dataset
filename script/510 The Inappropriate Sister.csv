Joey	 What are you doing?'
Ross	 I...reorganized the fridge. See, bottom shelf
Joey	 Why are you doing this?'
Ross	 Because I am bored...Out of my mind. I\xc2\x92ve already been to the\nbank, post office, and the dry cleaners.'
Joey	 Dude, you just described seven days worth of stuff. You\xc2\x92ve got to\nspread it out a little, you know. Haven\xc2\x92t you ever been unemployed?'
Ross	 Hey, I am not unemployed. I\xc2\x92m on sabbatical!'
Joey	 Hey, don\xc2\x92t get religious on me, ok. (Ross looks a little\nconfused.) A guy in your position needs to be a little better at relaxing. You know. Why\ndo you think we have the comfortable chairs? Huh...come here\xc2\x85sit down. (Ross sits\ndown.) Ready? (Joey flips the foot rest up.) Ahh!! (He reclines the chair fully.) Ohh,\nyeah!! Huh?!'
Ross	 So what, we just sit?'
Joey	 Ohh, no, no. We\xc2\x92re not going to just sit. (Joey sits down and\nhits the speed dial button on the phone.) Shhh. (It begins to ring.)'
Chandler	 (Answering the phone at work) Hello, Chandler Bing.'
Joey	 (In a high pitched female voice) Hello Mr. Bing...I love you.'
Chandler	 (Angrily) Alright, whoever this is, stop calling me! (Ross and\nJoey laugh silently.) It\xc2\x92s been six months! It\xc2\x92s not funny!'
Joey	 But, I love you.'
Chandler	 Leave me alone! For the love of God, leave me alone!!!\n(Joey hangs up.)'
Joey	 And that\xc2\x92s Wednesday. (He reclines in his chair.) Ohh.'
Phoebe	 Hey you guys, guess what?'
Chandler	 The British are coming?'
Phoebe	 Ohh, you and your ways. (She shakes the bell at him and sits down.)\nSince it\xc2\x92s Christmastime. I\xc2\x92m going to be one of those people collection\ndonations.'
Phoebe	 (Excitedly) Yeah, I already have my bell and later on...I get my\nbucket.'
Chandler	 Ohh.'
Phoebe	 Yeah, yeah, I\xc2\x92m going to be out there spreading joy to the\npeople. I mean, last year, I spread a little joy but not really enough. So this year,\nI\xc2\x92m going to do the whole city.'
Monica	 You know, I knew a girl in high school who did that. She was very\npopular. (Chandler laughs.)'
Joey	 So Pheebs, where are you doing all, your bell ringing?'
Phoebe	 Ohh, they gave me a great spot. Right by Macys. Yeah, they\nhardly ever give such a good spot to a rookie, but I\xc2\x92m the only one who can sing\n"Merry Christmas" in 25 languages. (She smirks.) I lied.'
Rachel	 Oh my god. Ok you guys, there\xc2\x92s Danny. Watch. Just watch this.\n(He walks past the couch to the counter.) See?! Still pretending he\xc2\x92s not interested.\nOhh, he\xc2\x92s coming over. Just pretend like we don\xc2\x92t know him. We\xc2\x92ve forgotten\nwho he is.'
Danny	 Hey guys.'
Monica	 Danny? You know Rachel? She\xc2\x92s nice. She\xc2\x92s not bad to look\nat, right?'
Rachel	 Thanks, Mon.'
Danny	 Well, of course.'
Monica	 Do you want to go out on a date with her?'
Rachel	 Monica!!!'
Danny	 (Looking at Monica) Absolutely! Is Friday okay?'
Monica	 Friday\xc2\x92s perfect...She can\xc2\x92t wait.'
Danny	 (To Monica) On the date, I will be able to talk to her directly? (To\nRachel) See ya Friday. (He walks out.)'
Rachel	 (Somewhat angrily) Okay. What the hell was that? You know what?\nDon\xc2\x92t answer me. (Giggling) I have a date with Danny.'
Joey	 How could I not get the part? The play was about a 29-year-old Italian\nactor from Queens.'
Joey	 She\xc2\x92s a woman!'
Joey	 (Very discouraged) Okay, is there anything else?'
Phoebe	 Happy Holidays. Feliz Navidad. Allo, and Merry Christmas. (A man put\nsome change in her bucket.) Ohh thank you sir. Here's some joy. (She waves her hand up and\ndown as if she is spreading joy.)"
Monica	 (Walking in from off screen.) Phoebe!'
Phoebe	 Hey!'
Monica	 I just wanted to see how it's going."
Phoebe	 Well, it's going okay."
Monica	 (Taking out her wallet.) Well good, here let me help you out. '
Phoebe	 Oh, thanks!'
Monica	 Yeah!'
Phoebe	 Wow!'
Phoebe	 Is that a new Swede jacket? It looks really expensive.'
Monica	 Yeah. I guess. (She puts more money in the bucket.)'
Phoebe	 Just get your nails done?'
Monica	 Yes Phoebe, but this is all I have. Okay? (She pours out the rest of her\nchange purse into the bucket.)'
Phoebe	 Okay! Thanks! Happy Holidays, here's your joy. (She waves her arm and\nspreads her joy.)"
Phoebe	 Thank you! And Happy Holidays.'
Phoebe	 Wait, you can't take the money out."
The Man	 I'm making change. I need change for the bus."
Phoebe	 But, can't you leave the dollar? This money is for the poor."
The Man	 I'm poor! I gotta take the bus!"
Phoebe	 Okay, Seasons Greetings and everything, but still\xc2\x85'
The Man	 Bite me, blondie! (The man storms off.)'
Phoebe	 Oh, I'm going to give him something else besides joy, just\xc2\x85 (She\nscowls at him.)"
Joey	 That part was perfect for me! I can't believe I didn't get it!"
Ross	 I'm sorry, man. Hey, y'know what you should do? You should make something\nhappen for yourself. Y'know, like-like write a play. Write a movie! Huh? I mean, what\nabout those Good Will Hunting guys?"
Joey	 Come on Ross be realistic, y'know? If I did write something, what are the\nchances I could get those guys to star in it?"
Joey	 Wait a second, I could star in it!'
Ross	 Or that.'
Joey	 I can't write! Y'know I mean I-I-I'm an actor, I don't have the discipline\nthat takes, y'know? I can't do it."
Ross	 I'll help you. Yeah, I'll make up a schedule and make sure you stick to\nit. And plus, it'll give me something to do."
Joey	 Really? You'd-you'd do that for me?!"
Ross	 Yeah!'
Joey	 Thanks!'
Ross	 (grabbing a notepad and sitting down) All right, we'll start off slow. The\nonly thing you have to do tonight is come up with the name of your main character."
Joey	 Done!'
Ross	 And it can't be Joey."
Joey	 It's not."
Ross	 Or Joseph.'
Joey	 (disappointed) Oh.'
Monica	 Hey, what's up?"
Rachel	 I just saw Danny getting on the subway with a girl and he had his arm\naround her.'
Monica	 Oh, honey, I'm sorry."
Rachel	 Well, you should be, this is all your fault! You meddled in our\nrelationship!!'
Monica	 You had no relationship!!'
Rachel	 No, but I was doing my thing and everything was going according to the\nplan!'
Monica	 Oh God, stop with the plan! So what, so what you saw him with a girl?\nWho cares?! That doesn't mean anything! Now look, you're going to go out on a date with\nDanny and you're going to be so charming he's gonna forget all about that stupid subway\ngirl."
Rachel	 She was kinda stupid. You're right. All right, I'm just gonna go on the\ndate. I'm gonna go on the date. That is the new plan."
Monica	 Come on, hurry!'
Joey	 Hey, how do you spell suspicious? '
Chandler	 Why?'
Joey	 Because I think this character is going to be suspicious about stuff.'
Chandler	 Yes! Chandler Bing, 7! Chandler Bing, 0.'
Joey	 You're driving me crazy with that!"
Chandler	 Okay, I'll stop."
Joey	 Don\xc2\x92t stop! Move the bowl further away! Ross could make that shot!'
Joey	 Well, you suck! But at least you suck at a man's game now."
Chandler	 You wanna play?'
Joey	 Chandler, I can't be playing games, Ross is gonna be home soon. And I have\nto write five whole pages if I'm gonna stick to his schedule."
Chandler	 Well, so, play for the next 30 minutes and then write until he gets\nhome.'
Joey	 (jumping up) All right! But uh, listen, what do you say we crank it up a\nnotch?'
Chandler	 I'm intrigued. "
Joey	 All right, all we need is a little lighter fluid. '
Chandler	 Okay, but be careful okay, because I wanna get our security deposit\nback.'
Joey	 Yeah, I think we said good-bye to that when we invented hammer darts.'
Chandler	 Do you even remember which part of the wall is not spackle?'
Joey	 Uh yeah, right here. (He punches his fist through the wall next to the\ndoor.)'
Phoebe	 Thank you, Happy Holidays.'
Phoebe	 Now, that's trash. Young lady, you can't\xc2\x85 (The lady ignores her and\nwalks off.) Hey! Stop that young lady, she donated trash!"
Phoebe	 Hey!! (The bucket starts smoking.) The charity's on fire! Help! (Yet\nanother guy walks by carrying a cup, which Phoebe grabs.) Oh good! Thank you, I need that.\n(She throws onto the smoldering fire. Suddenly the bucket erupts in flames.) Whoa! What is\nthat?! (She sniffs the cup.) (To the guy.) It's nine o'clock in the morning!"
Ross	 All right. (Reading.) A room. A man enters, he looks suspicious. (Stops\nreading a flips the page to find the next one is blank.) That's it? (Joey shrugs.) Joey,\nyou're supposed to have five pages done by now! Including an exciting incident!\n(Flipping through the rest of the pad.) And what is, and what is all this?! (Reading.) The\nofficial rulebook of Fireball."
Joey	 Yeah, that's the uh, game we were playing."
Chandler	 (entering from his room carrying a fire extinguisher and wearing oven\nmitts) Oh yeah, it's great! See you take a tennis ball, a bowl, and some lighter\nfluid\xc2\x97Op! Op! (He puts out a small fire which has re-ignited in his room.)"
Ross	 This is helping your career?! Huh? I thought you wanted to be an actor not\nthe creator of crazy lawsuit game!'
Joey	 You're right, you're right, I'll get back to work."
Ross	 (To Chandler) And shame on you! You should know better, Joey needs to\nwork. (To Joey) Now come on! '
Joey	 Hey!'
Ross	 No! Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah! You can have this back when the five pages are done!\n(After Joey walks past, Ross throws the ball down in pain.) Ahh! (Chandler shows him the\nburn spots on his oven mitts.)'
Danny	 I had a really nice time tonight.'
Rachel	 So did I. I'm really glad Monica asked us out."
Danny	 I'd love to ask you in, but uh, my sister's visiting and I think she's\nasleep on the couch."
Rachel	 You\'re sister? You\'re sister\'s asleep on the couch? (Danny nods,\n"Yes.") Ohhh! I saw her with you on the subway and now she\'s asleep on\nthe couch!'
Danny	 Oh hey, great, you're up. Rachel, this is my sister Krista. Krista, this\nis Rachel."
Rachel	 Hi!'
Krista	 Nice to meet you. I wish you'd told me we were having company, I'd fix\nmyself up!"
Danny	 Like it would help.'
Krista	 You are so bad! (Hits him softly.)'
Danny	 You are! (Hits her back.)'
Krista	 You are! (Hits him softly.)'
Danny	 You are! (Hits her back.)'
Krista	 You are! (Hits him softly.)'
Danny	 You are! (Hits her back.)'
Krista	 You are! (Hits him harder this time.)'
Danny	 You are so dead! I'm gonna get you. "
Rachel	 (not sure what to do) Uh, it was very nice meeting you. (They continue\nto ignore her.)'

Phoebe	 Nobody! Nobody respects the bucket! You wouldn't believe what people put\nin here! Look! (Hands it to Monica.) Okay, does this look like a garbage can to you?"
Monica	 No.'
Phoebe	 Does it look like an ashtray?'
Monica	 No.'
Phoebe	 Does it look like a urinal?'
Monica	 Eww!! (Throws the bucket down.)'
Ross	 So Pheebs, are you gonna go back out there or what?'
Phoebe	 Well, yeah! But I'm not gonna take anymore crap. Okay? No more Mrs. Nice\nBucket!"
Monica	 Yeah, good for you. Y'know you're tough, you lived on the streets."
Phoebe	 Yeah, I'm gonna go back to being Street Phoebe. Yeah! Oh but, y'know\nwhat? I can't go totally back because Street Phoebe really wouldn't be friends with you\nguys. Sorry. (Leaves.)"
Rachel	 (entering from her room) Hey!'
Monica	 Hey!'
Rachel	 Hey, umm, can I ask you guys something?'
Monica and Ross	 Sure.'
Rachel	 Uh, I don't have any brothers so I don't know, but uh, did you guys\nwrestle?"
Ross	 Oh-oh, yeah.'
Monica	 All the time. In fact, I was undefeated.'
Ross	 Uh, you weighted 200 pounds.'
Monica	 Still, I was quick as a cat.'
Rachel	 Well, I met Danny's sister yesterday, and uh that was actually the girl\non the subway."
Monica	 Oh, you're kidding."
Rachel	 Yeah, they were very y'know\xc2\x85wrestley. But, I guess that's normal?"
Monica	 (laughing with Ross) We don't, we don't wrestle now."
Ross	 Yeah, not since I got too strong for you.'
Monica	 Too strong for me?'
Ross	 Yeah.'
Monica	 You wanna go right now? 'Cause I'll take you right now, buddy! You wanna\ngo?"
Ross	 Oh fine.'
Monica	 Ready? (They grab a hold of each other's necks.) Wrestle! (They start\nwrestling.)"
Rachel	 Okay, y'know what uh, actually, that's great. That helps a lot. Thanks.\n(She leaves them to wrestle.)"
Chandler	 (entering from his bedroom) Guys, come on! Let's go! The puck drops in\n20 minutes! Come on, Joe!"
Ross	 Joey's not going."
Joey	 (To Chandler) I didn't finish my five pages."
Chandler	 Well, why can't you do them tomorrow?"
Ross	 Because tomorrow he's redoing yesterday's pages."
Joey	 Yesterday's pages did not reflect my best work."
Chandler	 (To Ross) Why don't you cut him a little slack? Okay? Maybe if he\nrelaxes a little bit, he'll get some work done."
Ross	 I think he's been relaxing enough, thanks to you and Fireball."
Joey	 Dude, if you think Fireball's relaxing, you've obviously have never\nplayed."
Chandler	 The only reason you're doing this to Joey is because you're bored.\nOkay, it's not his fault that you're unemployed."
Ross	 I am not unemployed. I'm on sabbatical!"
Joey	 Come on look guys, don't fight."
Ross	 And the reason I'm doing this is because I am Joey's friend. And if\nyou were a good friend, you'd be doing the same thing."
Chandler	 Oh, so being a good friend means acting like a total jerk?'
Ross	 If it does? Then you're an amazing friend of mine."
Joey	 Hey-hey guys, hey! How about we settle this over a friendly game of\nFireball? Huh? I'll go unhook the smoke detectors!"
Ross	 How about we settle this right now! (He rips up the tickets.) There! Now,\nno one's going to the game. Ha-ha-ha!"
Chandler	 I paid for those tickets!'
Ross	 No you didn't. You said you would, but you never did!"
Chandler	 Oh yeah! (Makes an unintelligible taunting sound.)'
Danny	 \xc2\x85so we finally get to the top of the mountain and airhead here (His\nsister) forgets the camera!'
Joey	 Oh, y'know the same thing happened to me one time."
Chandler	 When did that happen to you?!'
Joey	 Don't you remember when we were jogging in the park and we saw that really\npretty bird and wanted to take a picture\xc2\x97I didn't have my camera!"
Chandler	 Oh yeah. First off all, chasing the Churo guy isn't jogging."
Krista	 Oh, this is so good (A piece of cake.) you have got to try it. (She\ntakes some on her finger and feeds it to Danny. Then takes a little more and does it\nagain. Meanwhile, the rest of the gang stares on in shock. Then they pick up a part of it\nand some filling falls into his lap.)'
Danny	 Oh, damn! I got it on my pants.'
Krista	 Here, I'll get it. (She grabs a napkin and tries to wipe it up. The\nthing that gets the rest of the gang going is that she's whipping awfully close to his\ncrotch. In fact, she is whipping his crotch. Chandler's about to come out of his chair.)"
Krista	 We'd better take these pants off upstairs or that stain's gonna set."
Danny	 Yep. (To Rachel) I'm gonna wear these on our date tonight."
Rachel	 Oh, great!'
Chandler	 Okay, bye! (To the gang.) Oh my God!!'
Monica	 That was unbelievable! '
Rachel	 Okay, see? I told you!'
Joey	 Yeah, wow, sorry Rach.'
Chandler	 I don't believe they're brother and sister."
Joey	 They're brother and sister!!!"
Phoebe	 Oh whoa-whoa-whoa! Wait a minute, open up your hand; let me take a look.\n(The lady opens up her hand.) Quarter. Dime. Lint? Not interested in that. (She throws the\nlint away.) What's this? A Canadian coin? Get outta here! (The lady walks away.)"
Phoebe	 Whoa-whoa-whoa! No drinks near the bucket! Set it down over there and\nthen you can make a contribution! (The guy starts to walk away with a hurt look on his\nface.) And you can leave the hurt bunny look over there too! (Her boss and a co-worker\nwalk up.) Hi Bob! (The same old lady from before walks bye.) (To the old lady.) I thought\nI told you to get outta here!'
Bob	 Uh, Phoebe we've been getting complaints and uh, we're gonna move you to a\nless high-profile spot."
Phoebe	 What?!'
Bob	 Umm, Ginger's gonna take over this corner."
Phoebe	 That chick can't handle my corner."
Bob	 Look, either you leave, or we remove you.'
Phoebe	 Fine. (She hands her bell to Ginger and starts to take down her signs.)\n(The same old lady walks by again.) All right, I'll give you one pointer. Look out for\nthat bitch. (The old lady.)"
Danny	 Oh, hey Rach! I thought we said seven?'
Rachel	 Yeah uh, y'know what uh, let's skip it."
Danny	 What?! Why?!'
Rachel	 Umm, you-you and your sister seem to have umm, a very special bond,\nand\xc2\x85'
Danny	 Oh great! That special bond again! Why do women have such a\nproblem with the fact that I'm close with my sister?"
Rachel	 Well, okay, look. I don't know, listen, I don't know what's going on\nhere but let's\xc2\x85"
Danny	 Do-do you, do you have brothers?'
Rachel	 No, I have two sisters. But one of them has a very masculine energy.'
Danny	 Are you close with them?'
Rachel	 No-no, they're not very nice people."
Danny	 Okay, listen, I really like you. Okay? I think this can go somewhere. So\nwhat if I'm close to my family, are you gonna let that stand in the way of us?"
Rachel	 Well, uh, I-I don't know. See when-when you put it that way y'know it\ndoes sort of\xc2\x85"
Krista	 (calling from the bathroom) Danny! Hurry up! The bath is getting cold!'
Danny	 (seeing Rachel's shocked look) What?"
Rachel	 Yeah, okay, I'll see you later. (Gets up and runs from the apartment.)"
Chandler	 Oh hey! There's some kids playing in the street, you wanna go down\nthere and give them a project, ruin their day?"
Ross	 Hey, if they have a ball maybe you can stick razor blades in it and teach\nthem a new game, Gonna Need Stitches Ball.'
Joey	 (entering) Hey guys! I was at the library all morning and I already\nfinished my five pages for today!'
Ross	 Yay!'
Chandler	 Great! Now, we can go to the Ranger game! (Pause) Last night!'
Joey	 No dude, Ross tore up the tickets!'
Ross	 I guess when you don't have so many distractions, it's easier for you to\nfocus. Huh?"
Chandler	 Yeah or also when you don't have somebody breathing down your neck ALL\nTHE LIVE LONG DAY!!"
Joey	 Yeah, well, that's fine, but the important thing is that I finished it.\nAnd uh, I think it's really good, but y'know it'd really help me is if I could hear it. So\nwould you guys read it for me?"
Chandler	 All right. (Takes a copy.)'
Ross	 All right. (Takes another copy.)'
Joey	 Okay. (Reading.) "It\'s a typical New York City apartment. Two guys\nare hanging out." Ross (Points to him.)'
Ross	 Hey man.'
Chandler	 What is up?'
Ross	 About yesterday, I was really wrong. I am sorry.'
Chandler	 No, it was me. I'm sorry. I over reacted."
Ross	 Maybe it was both of us, but we had our best friend's interest\xc2\x85\n(Pauses and looks at Joey.) But we had our best friend's interest at heart."
Chandler	 Could I be more sorry. (Looks at Joey.)'
Ross	 I don't know, I'm one sorry polentologist. (Stops reading.) All right\nJoey, we get it. (To Chandler) I'm sorry."
Chandler	 (To Ross) I'm sorry too."
Joey	 Oh no! No-no, keep reading! The good part's coming up. Keep going."
Ross	 (reading from the script.) I am sorry, Chandler.'
Chandler	 I am sorry, Ross.'
Joey	 A handsome man enters. (Playing the part of the handsome man.) Hey! How's\nit going guys? I don't know what you two were talking about, but I'd like to say thanks to\nboth of you. You, (Ross) you wouldn't let me give up on myself, and you (Chandler) well\nyou co-created Fireball. The end."
Chandler	 This took you all day?!'
Joey	 No-no, this only took five minutes. I spent the rest of the day coming up\nwith new, Ultimate Fireball. (Takes out a bowling ball and a propane torch.) Ha-ha!'

Joey	 (Reading the scene set up.) Okay, it's a typical New York City apartment.\nTwo girls are just hanging out."
Monica	 Hi, how are you doing Kelly?'
Rachel	 I'm doing just fine! God, Tiffany, you smell so great!"
Monica	 It's my new perfume. Why don't you come closer where you can really\nappreciate it?"
Rachel	 Oh, y'know Joey, you are sick!"
Monica	 This is disgusting!'
Rachel	 I'm not reading this!"
Joey	 What?! Wait-wait-wait! The handsome man was about to enter!!'
