Monica	 Oh, the way you crushed Mike at ping pong was such\n  a turn-on.You wanna...? (plays with her finger on Chandlers chest)'
Chandler	 You know, I'd love to, but I'm a little tired."
Monica	 I'll put a pillowcase over my head."
Chandler	 You're on!"
Phoebe	 Hey!'
Monica	 What's up?"
Phoebe	 Well, okay, Mike's taking a shower, which by the\n  way there's  no law against. And then we're gonna grab some food, so if you\n  want..."
Ross	 ... finally...'
Phoebe	 Is that Ross?'
Monica	 Yeah, you can hear everything through these stupid\n  walls.'
Phoebe	 Sounds like he's with someone."
Chandler	 He could be alone. This morning I heard him do\n  push-ups, and then talk to his triceps.'
Monica	 Wait a minute, I think Phoebe's right. You know I\n  hear someone else in there with him."
Charlie	 Ooh... Dr. Geller!'
Ross	 God, you're amazing... I didn't even have to ask you\n  to call me that."
Monica	 Oh my God, that's Charlie!"
Chandler	 She's cheating on Joey with Ross!"
Phoebe	 Oh that tart... floozy... giant...'
Monica	 I'm not sure about this."
Phoebe	 Yeah, you're right. This is none of our business."
Monica	 No I'm not sure that it's  the best way to hear\n  everything. Someone get me a glass!"
Phoebe	 Oh, I'm not gonna do this, okay? I'm not gonna eavesdrop\n  on my friend."
Rachel	 (through wall) Ooh... I love Barbados!  '
Joey	 Ooh... I can't believe I'm kissing you. I'm\n    kissing Rachel!"
Rachel	 I know, I'm her!"
Phoebe	 (whispering) Rachel and Joey! It's Rachel and Joey!!!"
Monica	 What?'
Phoebe	 Get over here!'
Rachel	 ooh...'
Chandler	 Wow!'
Monica	 (in her Monica-excited-way... TOO LOUD!) Oh my God,\n  I love how thin these walls are!'
Monica	 (muffled) Thank you.'

Rachel	 Hey, you know, before you said\n    that nothing could happen between us? What changed?'
Joey	 Well, I only said that because of Ross, you know. Then\n  I saw him kissing Charlie...'
Rachel	 What? Ross and Charlie? (Joey nods) Wow! She's really\n  making her way through the group, huh? Ah, who am I to talk?"
Monica	 I can't believe this. Rachel and Joey?"
Chandler	 How about the dinosaur twins in the other room?\n  No-one is manning that wall!'
Monica	 I'm on it!"
Chandler	 Anything?'
Monica	 I think I hear curtains closing... '
Phoebe	 We've got shoes being kicked off over here."
Monica	 Bedsprings, unmistakable!'
Chandler	 You do realise  that's your brother?"
Monica	 Not until you said it. Somebody switch! (Chandler\n  makes a clicking sound with his fingers and Phoebe runs to the other wall.\n  Monica returns to Chandlers wall.) Wait a minute... Ross and Charlie, Joey\n  and Rachel, Phoebe and Mike! We're the only people  leaving with the\n  same person we came with."
Chandler	 That's not true. I came with Monica and I'm leaving\n  with Weird Al."
Monica	 Okay, I've had it with the hair jokes. Tomorrow morning,\n  before we leave, I'm going to the salon."
Chandler	 Okay Buckwheat!'
Phoebe	 You gotta hear this, it's great... It's like free\n  porn! (Chandler eagerly rushes over)"
Ross	 Weh...*sigh*'
Charlie	 uhm... Is everything okay?'
Ross	 Yeah, It's just... I don't think I can do this..."
Charlie	 Ooh... Is it because of what might be on the bedspread,\n  because I saw that news report too, with the infra red and the ... I could\n  just...'
Ross	 No, NO! (they're moving to the side of the bed, where\n  they sit down) Look, I need to talk to Joey. I mean, you guys just broke up.\n  Before anything more happens between us, I need to know he's okay with it."
Charlie	 I uhm... I completely understand.'
Ross	 Alright, I'm gonna go find them... (twitches a bit,\n  looks down) I just need a... need a before I can... you know. (gestures standing\n  up... they sit and wait for a while) Grandma... grandma... grandma... (he tries\n  to concentrate...) Okay, I see you later."
Charlie	 Okay...'
Phoebe	 That's the door. He's gone..."
Chandler	 And she's... turning on the TV... and watching...\n  Miss Congeniality!"
Monica	 Honey, if you know it through a wall, you know it\n  too well!'
Ross	 Hey, what are you guys doing?'
Phoebe	 Oh, we're just... we're sad to go so we're just saying\n  goodbye to the hotel. (hugs the wall) I love you... Paradise Hotel, Golf resort\n  and Spa... (she walks away from the wall)"
Monica	 (also hugs the wall) Yeah, we had a great time, thank\n  you! (walks to Phoebe)'
Chandler	 (caresses the wall with his finger) Bye!'
Ross	 Okay, uhm... Hey, you guys seen Joey anywhere?'
Chandler	 He's probably in his room with his current girlfriend\n  Charlie. That's the situation as we know it... (walks to Phoebe and Monica)"
Ross	 Well, if you see him could you please tell\n  him I'm looking for him?"
Chandler	 You got it!'
Ross	 Thanks! (walks out of the room and starts hugging the\n  wall) Thank you! (closes the door)'
Monica	 Other wall, people! Other wall!'
Ross	 (knocks on door) Rach,  you there? (Joey and Rachel\n  both get up from the bed)'
Joey	 Oh my God, it's Ross. What are we gonna do?"
Rachel	 Oh, ju-ju-just stay calm. Just be calm. For all he\n  knows we're just hanging out together. Right? Just be nonchalant. (Joey like\n  stands at attention with his chest forward and his hands on his sides, looking\n  up at the ceiling with his lips pouted.) That's not nonchalant!"
Joey	 No idea what it means.'
Rachel	 Oh... okay, just hide!'
Ross	 (knocks) Rach?'
Rachel	 Coming! Try under the bed, try under the bed!'
Rachel	 There's no room under the bed. (looks around because\n  she can't find Joey anymore)"
Ross	 Is everything okay?'
Rachel	 Yeah... (still looking to see where Joey went, and\n  opens the door)'
Ross	 Hey.'
Rachel	 Hi...'
Ross	 You know where Joey is?'
Rachel	 ...I really don't... (looks around again)"
Ross	 Can I talk to you for a minute?'
Rachel	 Yeah, sure... (looks outside into the corridor if\n  Joey is there)'
Joey	 I don't believe this... Have you guys been..."
Phoebe	 Shhh... This is the listening side of the\n  wall.'
Ross	 And then she told me that she and Joey had broken up,\n  and that part of the reason was that she had feelings for me.'
Rachel	 (clearly not listening and still trying to find out\n  where Joey went) Uh-huh... right... yeah...'
Ross	 And you know I wanted to ask Charlie out since the\n  day I met her.'
Rachel	 (still searching) Oh, I know... I know it's been\n  really hard for you."
Ross	 Anyway, one thing lead to another, and... oh... before\n  you know it, we were kissing. I mean, how angry do you think Joey is gonna\n  be?'
Rachel	 (now looking up at the ceiling) That is hard to say,\n  Ross. That is hard to say.'
Ross	 You know, I gotta go find him. He's gotta be here someplace."
Rachel	 You would think!'
Rachel	 Joey!'
Joey	 Is he gone?'
Rachel	 (still can't find him) How are you doing this?"
Joey	 Pssst...'
Rachel	 How... wha... Hey! What are you... What is this?\n  Have you guys been listening this entire time?'
Monica, Chandler and Phoebe	 YE-AH!'
Phoebe	 Now, what is this?'
Rachel	 Ah, what is this? Well, lets see, we kissed for ten\n  minutes and now we're talking to our friends about it, so I guess this is sixth\n  grade!"
Phoebe	 Oh no... Have you thought about it how complicated\n  this could get? What about Ross?'
Joey	 Well, he's with Charlie now."
Monica	 Yeah, but he wants to talk to you before anything\n  really happens with her. And as his friend, I mean, don't you think\n  he deserves the same from you?"
Joey	 (long pause and he twitches a bit) You're a pain in\n  my ass, Geller!"
Rachel	 All right, look you guys... Look, we appreciate all\n  the advice, but this is between Joey and me and I think we can handle it...'
Chandler	 Okay, well we'll go back in there, but will you\n  do one thing for us? The people that  care about you?"
Rachel	 Sure...'
Chandler	 Enunciate!'
Rachel	 Get out!'
Rachel	 Are they right?'
Joey	 Probably, yeah... I mean, maybe we should... hold off\n  until we talk to Ross.'
Rachel	 Yeah... Yeah, we can wait, we don't have\n  to do anything tonight."
Joey	 Yeah, I think that'd be best... So, so I'm gonna...\n  I'm gonna take off..."
Rachel	 (Joey walks to the door) Although... '
Joey	 (turns around very fast) I like although!'
Rachel	 I mean, you know... Ross and I haven't dated in like...\n  six years..."
Joey	 Six years? Wow... It's almost as long as highschool..."
Rachel	 Plus, you know, he is with Charlie now.'
Joey	 Absolutely! He's not thinking about you."
Rachel	 No...'
Joey	 I'm thinking about you..."
Rachel	 Yeah...'
Joey	 Let's forget about Ross..."
Rachel	 Forgotten.'
Joey	 What's wrong?"
Rachel	 Nothing...'
Joey's voice, but she sees Ross	 Seriously... What is it?"
Rachel	 Nothing... It's really... It's nothing... Come here,\n  come here..."
Joey's voice/Ross	 What's wrong?"
Rachel	 Sorry, I just uhm... I can't seem to get Ross out\n  of my head..."
Joey	 Well, maybe I can help. (he grabs her head passionately,\n  closes his eyes and kisses... Ross in Rachel's dress! He realises it too late,\n  and when he does, pushes Ross's/Rachel's head away)"
Rachel/Ross	 Ooh, your lips are so soft... Do\n  that again... (and she/he moves in for another kiss. Joey, pushes her head\n  away again...)'
Joey	 Yeah... we really need to talk to Ross...'
Both	 Yeah'

Ross	 Hey!'
Chandler	 Hey!'
Ross	 You guys ready to go?'
Chandler	 Not quite. Monica's still at the salon, and I'm\n  just finishing packing."
Ross	 Dude! You're not taking your Bible?"
Chandler	 You're not supposed to take that. Besides, it's\n  a New Testament, what are you gonna do with it?"
Ross	 Learn about Jesus...'
Ross	 Hey!'
Charlie	 So, did you talk to Joey?'
Ross	 Uh, no... no. I couldn't find him. I'm just gonna talk\n  to him on the plane."
Charlie	 Yeah, sounds like a good idea... Dr. Geller!'
Ross	 Stop it!'
Charlie	 PHD'
Ross	 You're filthy!"
Phoebe	 Hey, have you guys seen Monica?'
Ross	 Uh, actually I think she went to the salon.'
Phoebe	 Oh yeah, oh, she went to the salon alright...'
Monica	 Check it out!'
Phoebe	 Who's day just got better? CHANDLER!"
Chandler	 Hey!... aaaaaahhhh!'
Monica	 What do you think?'
Chandler	 I think.... I think I can see your scalp.'
Monica	 Don't you just love it?"
Ross	 Ye... Yeah... Yeah... You got shellfish in your head.'
Charlie	 It's so... something... You go girlfriend!"
Ross	 You've never said that in your life, have you?"
Charlie	 Not once.'
Ross	 I thought so.'
Monica	 And listen to this... (shakes her body so the shells\n  tingle)'
Chandler	 What d'ya know... It's a treat for the eyes and the\n  ears."
Joey	 Whoo, whoo. Wow, it's uhm... kinda weird that I'm sitting\n  next to Charlie after we broke up."
Chandler	 Yeah, it's almost if Air Barbados doesn't care\n  about your social life."
Joey	 Look, does someone mind switching to sit with Charlie?'
Ross	 Oh, I uh, I mean, I... dude, I spent the whole conference\n  with Charlie.'
Joey	 I understand...'
Ross	 No, I'll do it. (he quickly grabs Joey's boarding pass\n  and gives Joey his one.)"
Chandler	 Wish I could switch with someone. I really don't\n  wanna sit with Allen Iverson over there."
Phoebe	 Uhm... You know, once we're in the air and the captain\n  turns off the seatbelt sign... you feel free to roam about my cabin..."
Mike	 You should be careful when checking your overhead bins,\n  'cause items may shift during..."
Phoebe	 Aaah... you're not good at this..."
Mike	 You don't have to go home tonight, do you?"
Phoebe	 No, I think I can come over. It's Saturday, right?"
Mike	 Oh...'
Phoebe	 What?'
Mike	 Uhm... I can't do anything tonight."
Phoebe	 Why not?'
Mike	 I have a date.'
Phoebe	 You have a... You have a date? With who?'
Mike	 Oh, it's... my girlfriend."
Phoebe	 (lets go of his hand) You have...  have a girlfriend?'
Mike	 Yeah... Well, when... you and I broke up I started\n  seeing someone.'
Phoebe	 For how long?'
Mike	 Three months.'
Phoebe	 Three months? Okay... This is probably none of my\n  business, but uhm, how long do you think you're gonna keep seeing her?"
Mike	 I'll tell her that it's over tonight at dinner. I\n  promise."
Phoebe	 Oh, okay... good. You do that. And then when you\n  get home, maybe there'll be a special delivery package waiting for you."
Mike	 Maybe I'll sign for it. Tear it open. Pull out the\n  packing material..."
Phoebe	 You know what, we're gonna have sex. Let's just leave\n  it there."
Ross	 Right, I\'m gonna go talk to Joey. I think this is the\n  right time. He\'s always in a good mood after the flight attendant says "duty\n  free".'
Charlie	 Okay... Good luck.'
Rachel	 Ross is coming over. I think now would be a really\n  good time to talk to him.'
Joey	 I guess so. I'm just... really nervous."
Rachel	 Okay, well keep in mind that by the time you're done,\n  they'll probably be serving dinner."
Joey	 Ooh...'
Rachel	 Still nervous?'
Joey	 I'm gonna get the lasagna."
Ross	 Hey Rach...'
Rachel	 Yeah!'
Ross	 Do you mind if I sit here for a sec.?'
Rachel	 Yeah, yeah sure! Yeah! (mouths "Good luck" to\n  Joey and gets up from her seat)'
Ross	 Hey!'
Joey	 Hey!'
Ross	 So, I uhm... kinda need to talk to you about Charlie.'
Joey	 Yeah?'
Ross	 Okay, last night after you guys broke up... so sorry\n  to hear about that, by the way... Well, Charlie and I were talking, and...,\n  well...'
Joey	 You kissed.'
Ross	 Wha... (gasps) What? What would give you that idea?'
Joey	 I saw you.'
Ross	 Yeah, we kissed, but... nothing else... nothing else\n  happened, okay.'
Joey	 Ross, Ross, Ross... It's okay."
Ross	 What?'
Joey	 It's okay. You know, I totally understand,\n  alright? You guys, make way more sense than her and I ever did, you know. And...\n  I want you to be happy."
Ross	 Are you serious?'
Joey	 Yeah... Now I have something...'
Ross	 I am speachless... I mean the fact that you would put\n  my happiness first like that. I mean, you're an incredible friend, you know\n  that?"
Joey	 Oh... uh...  look... before you...'
Ross	 No, I mean it. You are so loyal man, and selfless,\n  and generous...'
Joey	 I am those things, yeah.'
Ross	 You know what? I know Chandler longer, so I always\n  think of him as my best friend, but now... I may have to rethink some\n  stuff...'
Joey	 Dude!'
Ross	 Hey, if there is ever, anything I can do for you...'
Joey	 I can't think of anything."
Ross	 Thanks!'
Joey	 Yeah.'
Rachel	 So hi!'
Ross	 Hi!'
Rachel	 So you eh, you talked to Joey?'
Ross	 Ah, yeah. We had a really good talk.'
Rachel	 Oh! That's great!"
Ross	 Yeah!'
Rachel	 Oh, so everything's okay?"
Ross	 Oh, no, it's great. It's great. He is... He is an amazing\n  guy."
Rachel	 Ah... Well, obviously I think so too.'
Ross	 Well, I'm so excited about this."
Rachel	 Really? Excited?'
Ross	 Are you kidding? I have had some very dirty dreams\n  about this...'
Rachel	 Excuse me! (and she walks back to Joey, who is still\n  looking very impressed about what Ross said to him. Rachel looks at him and\n  hits him.) You didn't tell him, did you?"
Joey	 I couldn't. He was saying all these really nice things\n  about me. I didn't want him to get mad and take 'em all back. I'm on a edge\n  on Chandler."
Rachel	 Oh God! Alright, fine. You know what Joey, forget\n  it. When we go back to New York, I will tell him.'
Joey	 Thank you. Yeah, I appreciate that.'

Phoebe	 Hi, Mike's place."
Mike	 Hey, it's Mike."
Phoebe	 Ooh, that was fast.'
Mike	 Oh, err... no, she's not here yet. You know, I think\n  I'm just gonna take off and break up with her over the phone..."
Phoebe	 Yeah, you can't do that! Oh, come on Mike, strap\n  on a pair.Why don't you just tell her that we got back together. You know,\n  women appreciate honesty. We also appreciate gentle spanking once in a while.\n  Just F.Y.I."
Mike	 One more thing... There... might be a picture of Precious\n  on my coffee table.'
Phoebe	 Her name is Precious? Is she a purebreed or did you\n  pick her up at the pound?'
Mike	 Anyway, I just wanna give you a heads up. '
Phoebe	 Okay, oh and you know, if she gets upset, just scratch\n  her tummy and give her a liver snout. (laughs and hangs up the phone)'
Precious	 Hi, I'm Precious, who are you?"
Phoebe	 (stunned) I... I'm Phoebe."
Precious	 Phoebe? Mike's ex-girlfriend Phoebe, the love of\n  his life? That Phoebe?"
Phoebe	 Enchant\xc3\xa9 (she holds out her hand, and they shake\n  hands)'
Monica	 Oh, I can't wait for everyone at work to see these...\n  (plays with her hair to make the shells tingle again) Ow!"
Chandler	 You go back to work tomorrow night, right?'
Monica	 Yeah!'
Chandler	 So if you want people to see them, then by definition\n  you're not  having them taken out... say, at the break of dawn?"
Monica	 Well, if I had them taken out, then I wouldn't be\n  able to do this. (she pushes Chandler on the couch and brushes her\n  hair and shells against Chandler's chest) You like that, right? (again, she\n  brushes her hair against his chest and hums...)"
Chandler	 What are you singing?'
Monica	 It\'s "Bolero" from "10".'
Chandler	 It\'s "Ride of the Valkyries" from "Apocalypse\n  Now"...\n  See, here\'s the thing
Monica	 You what? You said you liked them.'
Chandler	 Did I? Let's refresh. I believe what I said was\n  that I could see your scalp."
Monica	 Fine, so you don't like them. Everybody else does."
Chandler	 Again, let's journey back... As I recall what Rachel\n  said, was  she had never notice the shape of your skull before. And Joey...\n  Well, Joey didn't realise that there was anything different."
Monica	 You know what? I don't care. I like it like this,\n  and I'm gonna keep it. You're just jealous because your hair can't do this...\n  (and she shakes her head more violently) OUCH!"
Chandler	 Hit yourself in the tooth?'
Monica	 And the eye!'
Ross	 (gasps) Hi... There she is. Hi Emma. Oh my God, I missed\n  you. (kisses her) Oh Emma, I missed you so much. Hey... Did you have\n  a good time with grandma Green? Huh? Did she give you a bottle of anti-depressants\n  again to use as a rattle? (to Rachel)'
Rachel	 That was one time, Ross, and they were only like\n  5 milligrams.'
Ross	 Ooh hey, Emma, daddy has some presents for you okay?\n  Okay? I want you to wait right here. Come here sweetie.'
Rachel	 Aaah... Ross, actually there's something that I really\n  need to talk to you about."
Ross	 (unpacking his bag) Okay, shoot!'
Rachel	 Okay, uhm... alright, here's the deal."
Ross	 (gasps) OH NO!'
Rachel	 What? What is it?'
Ross	 Oh, major shampoo explosion!'
Rachel	 Uh, look Ross, this really isn't easy."
Ross	 Oh, it's all over everything. Why?\n  Why me? (looks up)"
Rachel	 Because you took three hundred bottles of shampoo?'
Ross	 I'm sorry, I'm sorry. You were saying?"
Rachel	 Well, yeah... Okay, look it's about me and..."
Ross	 Oh, not another one! Oh my G... And this is moisturiser.\n  It's even harder to clean! Why? Why do bad things happen to good people?"
Rachel	 Wow! Well, clearly this is not a good time.'
Ross	 Duh, you think? (enters the kitchen)'
Phoebe	 Okay, bye. Alright, so Mike's on his way over. See,\n  you thought you guys were meeting here, and he thought you were meeting at\n  the restaurant, so you know... Doesn't really matter who's right or wrong.\n  Point is... I'm gonna take off."
Precious	 I'm not letting you leave until you tell me what's\n  going on here. I mean, are you guys getting back together or something?"
Phoebe	 Alright... Susie, can I call you Susie?'
Precious	 My name is Precious.'
Phoebe	 Yeah, I can't say that. uhm... Susie, I'm gonna be\n  straight with you... Mike and I are back together... and uhm... unfortunately\n  that effectively ends your relationship with him. And he's very sorry about\n  that and wishes you the best of luck in all your endeavours."
Precious	 I just can't believe this... Why?"
Phoebe	 Well, I don't..."
Precious	 Oh, why would he do this? I mean, what's wrong\n  with me?"
Phoebe	 Nothing, there's nothing wrong with you."
Precious	 I mean, what the hell am I supposed to do now?'
Phoebe	 Damn it woman, pull yourself together! Have\n    some pride, for the love of God.'
Phoebe	 Okay, not a fan of the tough love.'
Precious	 I just can't believe that Mike didn't give me any\n  warning."
Phoebe	 But he didn't really know, you know. He wasn't planning\n  on coming to Barbados and proposing to me..."
Precious	 He proposed to you? This is the worst birthday  ever.\n  (she starts to cry again)'
Phoebe	 Look, Precious... Mike's not worth this.\n  You're an attractive, intelligent woman and let's face it, Mike's kind of a\n  wang. I mean, he proposed to me while he was still seeing you... He was gonna\n  break-up with you on your birthday? And, I don't like to kiss-and-tell,\n  but he cheated on you a lot this weekend."
Precious	 Oh, my God, maybe you're right. Maybe I don't need\n  him. I deserve to be treated with respect."
Precious	 Screw you, Mike. You're a coward and a bastard,\n  and I hope you rot in hell. "
Phoebe	 You're welcome!"
Chandler	 Honey, you've been in there for a long time...\n  Is everything okay?"
Monica	 Not really. '
Monica	 I have a problem.'
Chandler	 Really? What happened?'
Monica	 Well, I was dancing around, and singing "No Woman,\n  No Cry" and I got stuck.'
Chandler	 You can't move at all?"
Monica	 Oh, well, I can move... (she moves back and forth\n  the shower curtain rail, opening and closing the shower curtain with her hair\n  as she goes)'
Chandler	 If I untangle you, will you please get rid of the\ncorn rose?'
Monica	 (looking disappointed) I guess so...'
Chandler	 (trying to untangle her) Some of these look a little\n  frayed.'
Monica	 Yeah, I tried to gnaw myself free.'
Joey	 Hey!'
Rachel	 Hi!'
Joey	 So, did you err... did you tell Ross?'
Rachel	 Well, I tried, but then he had a shampoo related\n  emergency. So I guess now it's your turn again."
Joey	 No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no... I think it's better\n  if you tell him, you know. It's easier for a woman. That way, you know, if\n  he gets mad, all you have to do is go... I didn't mean it. I'm so so--ooory. (he\n  pushes  his breasts together from the side)"
Rachel	 Yeah, 'cause that's what we do."
Joey	 Alright, alright, okay, uhm... How 'bout this, how\n  about this? Tomorrow... tomorrow we'll both go and we'll tell him together."
Rachel	 Okay, that sounds fair. It just means that once again\n  we can't..."
Joey	 I know, I know..., but that's okay. I mean, we can\n  control ourselves, we're not animals."
Rachel	 No! Of course we can wait. Alright, so I guess that\n  means good night then?'
Joey	 Yeah! Good night! (they give each other a small kiss\n  on the mouth, and stare at each other for a while)'
Rachel	 Goo--ood night!'
Joey	 Good night! (they give each other a kiss again, but\n  this time it lasts longer)'
Rachel	 Seriously, good night!'
Joey	 Stop saying good night.'
Rachel	 Okay.'


Monica	 Look what I found in the drawer... (Chandler looks\n  up from his book.) And you said I'd never wear this..."
Chandler	 Now that I untangled you, how 'bout you doing a\n  little something for me?"
Monica	 Sure, what do you have in mind?'
Chandler	 I think you know.'
Monica	 Really? I don't really feel like it."
Chandler	 This is what I want to do.'
Monica	 Okay, I just don't get why you like it so much."
Chandler	 (Picks up the "Miss Congeniality" DVD) She\'s an\n  FBI agent, posing as a beauty contestant.'
