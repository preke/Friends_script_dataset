Joey	 Probably Monica and Chandler.'
Woman	 (to Gunther) Hi. Could I have a pack of Newport Lights,\nplease?'
Gunther	 Oh umm, uh we don\xc2\x92t sell cigarettes, but they have them at the\nnewsstand across the street. (Points.)'
Woman	 That\xc2\x92d be great, thanks. (Gunther goes and gets them.)'
Rachel	 (to the gang) Oh my God, Melissa Warburton. I don\xc2\x92t think I have\nthe energy for this.'
Melissa	 (Gasps when she notices Rachel) Oh my God! Ray-ray Green?! (Screams)'
Rachel	 (screaming) Melissa!'
Melissa	 You have been M.I.A for the past seven sorority newsletters,\nwhat\xc2\x92s up with you?!'
Rachel	 Wh\xc2\x97(Turns and looks at the gang who\xc2\x92s staring)\xc2\x97Why\ndon\xc2\x92t I tell you over here? (She walks Melissa away from the gang.)'
Melissa	 So last I heard you were gonna get married. (Grabs Rachel\xc2\x92s hand\nand notices that she doesn\xc2\x92t have a ring on it.) (Sadly) Oh poor Ray-ray.'
Rachel	 Oh no-no, no! It\xc2\x92s good! It\xc2\x92s all good! I-I actually work at Ralph\nLauren!'
Melissa	 Shut up!'
Rachel	 I will not! I\xc2\x92m the divisional head of men\xc2\x92s sportswear!'
Melissa	 Oh shut up more! Now, are you friends with Ralph?'
Rachel	 Oh please\xc2\x85'
Melissa	 (excitedly) Are you?!'
Rachel	 No.'
Melissa	 Listen, we-we have to have dinner. What-what are you doing tomorrow\nnight?'
Rachel	 Oh tomorrow, oh I don\xc2\x92t know. Um\xc2\x85'
Melissa	 You do now. You\xc2\x92re having dinner with me.'
Rachel	 Shut up.'
Melissa	 I-I\xc2\x92ve got to go. This has been so great Ray-ray! (Gunther returns\nwith her cigarettes.) Oh, there you are. (Takes them from Gunther.) (To Rachel) Umm, so\nlisten, just call me. Here\xc2\x92s my card. (Hands the card over.)'
Rachel	 Oh, wow thanks! (Reading the card) Oh you\xc2\x92re in real estate!'
Melissa	 Oh no, that\xc2\x92s-that\xc2\x92s an old card. Umm, I wanted to get out of\nthat and-and do something where I can really help people and-and make a difference.'
Rachel	 Wow! What do you do now?'
Melissa	 (quietly) I\xc2\x92m a party planner. I\xc2\x92ll see you tomorrow.\n(Exits.)'
Rachel	 Okay! (Joins the rest of the gang.)'
Joey	 Hey guys! Look who\xc2\x92s back! It\xc2\x92s Ray-ray!'
Rachel	 Shut up that was my friend Melissa from college.'
Ross	 She seems really, really fun!'
Rachel	 She\xc2\x92s actually very sweet and we used to be very close.'
Monica	 Wait a minute, she isn\xc2\x92t\xc2\x85 She\xc2\x92s not the one who you\xc2\x85'
Joey	 (excitedly) Who you what? Who you what?!'
Rachel	 (To Monica) Yes.'
Monica	 Wow!'
Joey	 (excitedly) Wow? Wow what?! Wow what?! Who you\xc2\x97what?!!'
Rachel	 It\xc2\x92s not a big deal!'
Monica	 (To Joey) They were lovers.'
Ross	 What?!'
Joey	 What?!'
Rachel	 No we weren\xc2\x92t! It was nothing! It was one night, senior year we\nwent to a party, had a lot of sangria and y\xc2\x92know, ended up\xc2\x85kissing for a\nbit.'
Ross	 So that\xc2\x92s two of my wives.'

Monica	 (telling Chandler the seating arrangement) Okay so this is where the\nband is. (Points.) And this is where the bar is. (Points) And all these pins have\npeople\xc2\x92s names on them. (She has pins to show the seating at each of the tables.) And\nRach, here you are. (Points to Rachel\xc2\x92s place.)'
Rachel	 Oh wow. Why don\xc2\x92t we just take me (Grabs her pin) and put me with a\nManhattan in my hand, talking to the cute bartender. (Puts her pin at the bar and laughs.\nMonica just glares at her.) These pins aren\xc2\x92t for playing are they?'
Monica	 (To Chandler) Okay, the red ones are my guests and the blue ones are\nyours.'
Chandler	 This is so sad. I mean, I only have like ten pins.'
Monica	 Chandler, relax it\xc2\x92s not a contest. (To Rachel) Certainly not a\nclose one.'
Joey	 (entering) Hello!'
Rachel	 Hey!'
Joey	 Hey Rach. (Stares at her.) '
Rachel	 Stop picturing it!!'
Monica	 Okay, I think that\xc2\x92s it. The seating chart is done. This is our\nwedding. They all look like they\xc2\x92re having fun don\xc2\x92t they?'
Joey	 Hey, so where are my parents gonna be?'
Monica	 Oh! (Gets up) Let\xc2\x92s see, well\xc2\x85if this is the wedding hall then\numm (Walks away) you\xc2\x92re parents will be at home in Queens.'
Joey	 What they\xc2\x92re not invited?! Oh no, that\xc2\x92s terrible! They\xc2\x92re\ngonna be crushed!'
Monica	 Why would they think they\xc2\x92re invited?'
Joey	 (looking around) You got me. I don\xc2\x92t\xc2\x85'
Monica	 Joey!'
Joey	 Well, I\xc2\x92m sorry. I thought parents were coming! Y\xc2\x92know? Your\nparents are comin\xc2\x92! Chandler\xc2\x92s parents are comin\xc2\x92! Ross\xc2\x92s parents are\ncomin\xc2\x92!'
Monica	 Ross\xc2\x92s parents are my parents!'
Joey	 Well-well\xc2\x97see? Parents are comin\xc2\x92!'
Chandler	 Y\xc2\x92know I think we should invite them.'
Monica	 Oh please, you just want more blue pins.'
Chandler	 Well this is just sad!'
Monica	 All right, all right. Maybe I can fit them in if I just do some\nrearranging. But uh, Rachel may actually have to sit at the bar!'
Rachel	 That is not a problem.'
Joey	 (leaning down to her) Maybe you\xc2\x92ll order a little sangria?'
Rachel	 Oh, get out of here! (Jumps back and walks away.)'
Rachel	 (motioning to a rack) So now, these are all the tuxedos that we make and\nif there\xc2\x92s anything that you like, we can make you a deal. Anything at all. (Grabs a\nfew) But these are the three that Monica pre-approved.'
Chandler	 Well, thanks a lot for hookin\xc2\x92 me up Rach. I want you to know\nthat I want you to attend our wedding as my guest.'
Rachel	 I\xc2\x92m Monica\xc2\x92s maid of honor. Okay? Don\xc2\x92t try to blue pin\nme!'
Chandler	 (sees another rack) Well, what\xc2\x92s the deal with these? These-these\nlook nice.'
Rachel	 Oh they are nice. We-we custom-make tuxedos for celebrities and then\nwhen they\xc2\x92re done with them they just send \xc2\x91em back.'
Chandler	 You mean like for award shows?'
Rachel	 Some of them.'
Chandler	 You mean these tuxes have been down the red carpet with people\nyelling, "You are you wearing?! You look fabulous!"'
Rachel	 Honey, might I suggest watching a little more ESPN and a little\nless E!?'
Chandler	 Okay, who wore those? (Points to the tuxedos.)'
Rachel	 Umm, well let\xc2\x92s see uh, this one is Tom Brokaw.'
Chandler	 Not bad.'
Rachel	 (reading a tag) This one is uh Paul O\xc2\x92Neil.'
Chandler	 Who\xc2\x92s that?'
Rachel	 He plays for the Yankees. Seriously, ESPN! Just once and a while,\nhave it on in the background. (Chandler nods and Rachel grabs another tux) Ooh, this one\nwas Pierce Brosnan!'
Chandler	 Pierce Brosnan?'
Rachel	 Uh-huh.'
Chandler	 Are you serious?'
Rachel	 Yeah.'
Chandler	 007?! This is James Bond\xc2\x92s tux?!'
Rachel	 Yeah.'
Chandler	 Oh, I have to get married in James Bond\xc2\x92s tux!'
Rachel	 It\xc2\x92s a pretty cool tux.'
Chandler	 Oh, it\xc2\x92s not just that, I would be England\xc2\x92s most powerful\nweapon. Jet setting heartbreaker on her majesty\xc2\x92s secret service. A man who fears no\none; with a license to kill. (Worried.) Would Monica let me wear this?'
Joey	 We should really learn how to play the real way. (Moves another piece.)'
Phoebe	 I like our way. Oh! (Grabs a piece and jumps a bunch of Joey\xc2\x92s like\nin Checkers.) Chess!'
Joey	 Nice move.'
Phoebe	 Yeah.'
Rachel	 (entering) Hey!'
Joey	 Hey!'
Phoebe	 Hey!'
Rachel	 So Joey I just hooked Ross and Chandler up with some tuxedos for the\nwedding, do you need one?'
Joey	 No, I\xc2\x92m performing the ceremony. I\xc2\x92m not wearing a tux.'
Rachel	 Well, what are you going to wear?'
Joey	 Multi-colored robes! Ooh, and maybe a hat.'
Rachel	 Huh. Does Monica know about this?'
Joey	 I don\xc2\x92t think so.'
Rachel	 Can I please be there when you tell her? (Joey nods yes.)'
Phoebe	 Hey oh, Rach wait! Do you want to go to a movie tonight?'
Rachel	 Oh, y\xc2\x92know what? I can\xc2\x92t. I have to have dinner with that\nMelissa girl.'
Joey	 (excitedly) Can I come?! I won\xc2\x92t even talk! You\xc2\x92ll just hear the\nnoise from my video camera.'
Phoebe	 What is this? What\xc2\x92s going on?'
Joey	 Oh good! Can I tell her?! Can I tell her?!'
Rachel	 Well, do you want to hear what actually happened or Joey\xc2\x92s lewd\nversion?'
Phoebe	 Joey\xc2\x92s!'
Joey	 Okay\xc2\x85'
Rachel	 Hey, come on! I had this friend from college and I made the stupid\nmistake of telling Joey that one time\xc2\x85she and I y\xc2\x92know\xc2\x85kissed a little bit.'
Phoebe	 (laughs) Yeah, I\xc2\x92m sure that happened.'
Rachel	 It-it did!'
Phoebe	 Sure!'
Joey	 Hey. (Laughs then seriously) It happened!'
Rachel	 Yeah, it was senior year in college. It was after the Sigma Chi luau and\nMelissa and I got very drunk! And we ended up kissing! For several minutes! '
Phoebe	 (To Joey) Which means she had a couple spritzers and a quick peck on the\ncheek.'
Joey	 Why are you taking this away from me?'
Rachel	 Yeah, why is it so hard for you to believe?!'
Phoebe	 Okay! I just\xc2\x97I didn\xc2\x92t know that you are a lesbian. (Joey\nsmiles and nods lewdly.)'
Rachel	 I\xc2\x92m not saying that I\xc2\x92m a lesbian! I\xc2\x92m just saying that\nthis happened!'
Phoebe	 Okay, it just seems pretty wild and you\xc2\x92re so\xc2\x97y\xc2\x92know\nso\xc2\x85vanilla.'
Rachel	 (shocked) Vanilla?!'
Phoebe	 Yeah.'
Rachel	 I\xc2\x92m not vanilla! I\xc2\x92ve done lots of crazy things! I mean I\ngot-I got drunk and married in Vegas!'
Phoebe	 To Ross.'
Rachel	 All right, y\xc2\x92know what? If you don\xc2\x92t want to believe me about\nthis, why don\xc2\x92t you just come with me to dinner tonight and she will tell you.'
Phoebe	 Okay! All right! Yeah! \xc2\x91Cause I just can\xc2\x92t picture it.'
Joey	 Oh-ho, you should get inside my head.'
Ross	 Hey! Guess what I got for your wedding! (Holding up his garment bag.)'
Chandler	 A freakish thin date with a hanger for her head?'
Ross	 No. Rachel hooked me up with a tux! But not just any tux, Batman\xc2\x92s\ntux!'
Chandler	 What?'
Ross	 That\xc2\x92s right! Made expressly for Val Kilmer and worn by him in the\nhit film\xc2\x85that Batman film he was in.'
Chandler	 You can\xc2\x92t wear that! I\xc2\x92m wearing the famous tux! James\nBond\xc2\x92s tux!'
Ross	 So?'
Chandler	 So\xc2\x97If you wear that you\xc2\x92ll make mine less special.'
Ross	 Well, you need something to make this day special? Hello! You-you-you have\nthe most special thing of all! You are marrying the woman you love.'
Chandler	 Please, don\xc2\x92t take away my cool thing. Please?! Pretty please?!'
Ross	 Pretty please? Not very uh, 007.'
Chandler	 Look, it\xc2\x92s my wedding day okay? If you were getting married I\nwould never do anything to upset you.'
Ross	 When I got married you slept with my sister.'
Chandler	 That was pretty 007.'
Joey	 Hey.'
Monica	 Hey. Oh good-good you\xc2\x92re here! All right, I figured it out.\nI\xc2\x92m gonna take two tables of eight, I\xc2\x92m gonna add your parents, and I\xc2\x92m\ngonna turn them into three tables of six. Okay? And I called the caterer; I added two\nextra meals, we are good to go!'
Joey	 Yeah, they\xc2\x92re not coming.'
Monica	 (looking at him) What?!'
Joey	 Somehow they got the idea that you only invited them because of me.\nThey\xc2\x85feel a little unwanted.'
Monica	 Oh that\xc2\x92s too bad. It\xc2\x92s true, but too bad.'
Joey	 Look Mon, if you could just call my mom\xc2\x85'
Monica	 Oh Joey!'
Joey	 Come on! Look just-just tell\xc2\x97let her know that you really want them\nto be there. Let\xc2\x92s not forget, this is a woman that has sent you many lasagnas over\nthe years.'
Monica	 No she hasn\xc2\x92t.'
Joey	 Is it her fault that some of them didn\xc2\x92t make it to you?'
Monica	 Well, what am I going to say?'
Joey	 I don\xc2\x92t know. Just uh, just tell \xc2\x91em it was a mix-up with the\ninvitations, or\xc2\x97No-no-no! Blame it on the post office. They hate the post\noffice. And the Irish! But I don\xc2\x92t think you can blame it on them so\xc2\x85 (He dials\nthe phone and hands it to Monica.)'
Monica	 (on phone) Hello? (Listens) Yeah, hi! Mrs. Tribbiani? (Listens) Hi, this\nis Monica Geller. (Listens) Yeah I\xc2\x92m just calling to say that Chandler and I uh,\nreally hope you can make it to the wedding. Yeah, apparently a bunch of invitations that\nwe sent weren\xc2\x92t delivered. Umm, I guess there was some screw up at the damn post\noffice! (Joey nods his approval.) (Listens) T-Tell me about it! (Listens) Yeah, yeah, the\nUS Post Office? No, more like US lost office! (Listens) What are they Irish?! (Joey gives\nher a thumbs up.)'
Melissa	 \xc2\x85anyway, his name is Allan and we\xc2\x92ve been going out for three\nyears. He was my first client when I became a party planner. He was planning a party for\nhis girlfriend at the time. Oh well. (Rachel and Phoebe politely laugh) And he was Theta\nBeta Pi at Syracuse.'
Rachel	 Oh. Oh, that\xc2\x92s great!'
Melissa	 Hmm Phoebe, were you ever in a sorority?'
Phoebe	 Of course! Yeah, I was uh, umm Thigh Mega Tampon.'
Melissa	 What one?'
Phoebe	 Yeah! Y\xc2\x92know, we were really huge too, but then they had to shut us\ndown when Regina Philange died of alcohol poisoning.'
Melissa	 Oh, isn\xc2\x92t a shame when one girl ruins it for the whole bunch?\n(Phoebe agrees by grunting.)'
Rachel	 (changing the subject) Anyway, speaking of drinking too much. I was uh,\ntellin\xc2\x92 Phoebe about that one crazy night after the Sigma Chi luau where you and I\nuh, we made out.'
Melissa	 (shocked) What?'
Rachel	 Remember?! We\xc2\x97come on both had the sarongs on, and we had the-the\ncoconut bikini tops\xc2\x85'
Melissa	 Yeah?'
Rachel	 \xc2\x85we went back the house and we got really silly and we\xc2\x85we made\nout.'
Melissa	 Oh wow, Ray-ray I have no idea what you\xc2\x92re talking about.'
Phoebe	 Really?!'

Chandler	 Ross is Batman!'
Monica	 Well, he did manage to keep his identity secret for a long time.'
Chandler	 Rachel got Ross the tuxedo that Val Kilmer wore in Batman. Okay Batman\nis so much cooler than James Bond!'
Monica	 What are you talking about?! 007 has all those gadgets!'
Chandler	 Batman has a utility belt!'
Monica	 007 has a fancy car!'
Chandler	 Batman has the Batmobile!'
Monica	 007 gets all the ladies.'
Chandler	 Batman has Robin! (Pause) We get ESPN right?'
Monica	 How about you go put on your 007 tuxedo and I\xc2\x92ll make you a nice\nmartini.'
Chandler	 Actually, I don\xc2\x92t like martinis.'
Monica	 How about a Youhoo with a funny straw?'
Chandler	 Ooh, yum! (Runs into the bedroom.)'
Joey	 (entering) Hey.'
Monica	 Hey.'
Joey	 Listen, I know the invitation says 6
Monica	 The show?!'
Joey	 Right. Right. The wedding, gotcha. But I mean, it\xc2\x92s gonna start a\nlittle late right? I mean, weddings start late. Right?'
Monica	 Have you ever been to one of my weddings?'
Joey	 Ah. Yeah. Well look, the thing is it\xc2\x92s the same day as my\nniece\xc2\x92s christening and I really want my parents to be there in time to see me.\n\xc2\x91Cause my part\xc2\x92s just in the beginning I\xc2\x92m not even in the rest of the\nshow\xc2\x97Wedding!'
Monica	 The wedding starts at six.'
Joey	 Okay. Okay, I totally hear ya. Oo how about this? I vamp a little\n\xc2\x91til they get there?'
Monica	 You\xc2\x92ll vamp?!'
Joey	 Yeah! Yeah y\xc2\x92know, like warm up the crowd. Ask \xc2\x91em where\nthey\xc2\x92re from. \xc2\x91Cause in Joey Tribbiani you get a minister and you get an\nentertainer. I\xc2\x92m a minis-tainer! (Rapping) There is no one better! There is no one\ngreater!'
Rachel	 How can you not remember us kissing?!'
Melissa	 I don\xc2\x92t know. I don\xc2\x92t remember a lot of things that never\nhappened.'
Rachel	 Wh\xc2\x85 Come on! Remember? We were on the sleeping porch! We\ncouldn\xc2\x92t stop giggling? And our coconuts kept knockin\xc2\x92 together?'
Phoebe	 Oh, somewhere Joey\xc2\x92s head is exploding.'
Rachel	 Yeah\xc2\x97but come on\xc2\x97Listen, I\xc2\x92m sorry I don\xc2\x92t want to\nmake you uncomfortable, but I told Phoebe that it happened and she doesn\xc2\x92t believe\nme.'
Melissa	 I\xc2\x92m sorry Ray-ray. I mean if I thought it happened I would say it.\nMaybe I passed out and you did stuff to me while I was sleeping.'
Rachel	 No!!'
Phoebe	 Rachel, it\xc2\x92s okay. You don\xc2\x92t have to do this. I believe you.\nAll right? Okay, if-if you say that you kissed Melissa, then you kissed Melissa.'
Rachel	 Thank you Phoebe.'
Melissa	 She didn\xc2\x92t.'
Phoebe	 I know.'
Ross	 Hey!'
Monica	 You just carry that around?'
Ross	 Yes. I find it to be something of a conversation piece. '
Monica	 Between you and\xc2\x85'
Ross	 Gunther. (To Chandler) Hey-hey! Why don\xc2\x92t we put them on? Y\xc2\x92know\nget a picture of Batman and James Bond together.'
Chandler	 I would but mine doesn\xc2\x92t fit. The pants are a little tight.'
Monica	 A little tight? I could see double-oh and seven in those pants.'
Ross	 Well that stinks. I was looking forward to us wearing our celebrity tuxes\ntogether.'
Chandler	 Well, does that mean that you\xc2\x92re not going to wearing yours?'
Ross	 What are you kidding? It\xc2\x92s Batman\xc2\x92s tux!!'
Chandler	 (standing up) Let me try it on!'
Ross	 Okay, but just the jacket. Double-oh and seven are not gettin\xc2\x92 in\nthere.'
Chandler	 (trying on the jacket) Okay. Holy double-vented comfort Batman! (Finds\nsomething in the pocket) What\xc2\x92s this?'
Ross	 What?'
Chandler	 An invitation for the At First Sight premiere? Oh my God! Val\nKilmer didn\xc2\x92t wear this in Batman! He wore it to the premiere of some tooty-fruity\nlove story where he played a blind guy!'
Ross	 Let me see that! (Grabs the invitation and reads it.) Oh man!'
Chandler	 The only superpower you have is a slightly heightened sense of smell.\n(Hands him the jacket and walks away.)'
Joey	 (entering) Hey! Uh, Monica? Chandler? Can I talk to you guys for a second?'
Monica	 All right that\xc2\x92s it, I give up! Whatever you want you can have it!\nYou wanna sing a song? You wanna do a dance? You want your mom stand at the Alter and\nscream racial slurs? I don\xc2\x92t care!'
Joey	 No! No, I-I just wanna thank you guys for what you did for my parents,\nthat was really sweet. They\xc2\x92re so happy they get to be a part of your special day.'
Monica	 (defeated) Oh.'
Chandler	 Well, you\xc2\x92re welcome. And tell them we\xc2\x92re really glad\nthey\xc2\x92re coming.'
Joey	 Okay. I will. Ohh! Check out what they got me to wear for the ceremony!\n(Runs to his apartment and returns wearing a rather silly hat.) Huh? I wear it like this\nwhen I marry you guys, and then this (He tilts it to the side of his head) is for party\ntime.'
Rachel	 It happened! I am telling you it happened!'
Melissa	 Okay. (To Phoebe) Well, it was great meeting you. And uh Rachel, I-I\ndon\xc2\x92t think I\xc2\x92ll be calling you (hails a cab) because umm, y\xc2\x92know\nyou\xc2\x92ve gotten weird. (The cab pulls up.) Take care you guys.'
Rachel	 What?! Wait a minute! No wait a minute! (She does so.) Okay? Look, that\nnight was the one wild thing I have ever done in my entire life, and I\xc2\x92m not\ngonna let you take that away from me! Okay, so if you don\xc2\x92t remember that, maybe\nyou will remember this! (She grabs Melissa and kisses her on the lips.)'
Melissa	 My God! You love me!'
Rachel	 (shocked) What?'
Melissa	 Of course I remember our kiss. I think about it all the time. I can\nstill hear the coconuts knockin\xc2\x92 together I\xc2\x85 (Phoebe is shocked.) I just\ndidn\xc2\x92t want to tell you \xc2\x91cause I didn\xc2\x92t think that you\xc2\x92d return my\nlove, and now that you have\xc2\x85 (Leans in to kiss Rachel.)'
Rachel	 (moving away) Whoa! Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! Whoa! Whoa!'
Melissa	 Aww, look who\xc2\x92s being suddenly shy. You can\xc2\x92t tell me you\ndon\xc2\x92t feel what I feel. Nobody can kiss that good and not mean it. (Goes in again.)'
Rachel	 (moves away again) I-I-I-I\xc2\x92m just\xc2\x85I\xc2\x92m just a good kisser!'
Melissa	 (suddenly frightened) Shut up!'
Rachel	 I\xc2\x92m sorry!'
Melissa	 (laughs) Oh you don\xc2\x92t have to be (Laughs again) sorry.\nI\xc2\x92m\xc2\x85I\xc2\x92m obviously kidding. I\xc2\x92m not in love with you. (To Phoebe)\nI\xc2\x92m not in love with her. I don\xc2\x92t hear coconuts banging together. Yeah, I\ndon\xc2\x92t\xc2\x85picture your face when I make love to my boyfriend. Anyway, I gotta go.\nEh\xc2\x85kiss good-bye? (Rachel stares at her stunned.) No? Okay. (Hurries into the cab and\ndrives off.)'
Rachel	 Wow! I mean I had no idea that that was gonna\xc2\x85'
Rachel	 What the hell was that?!'
Phoebe	 I just wanted to see what all the fuss was about.'
Rachel	 And?'
Phoebe	 I\xc2\x92ve had better.'

Chandler	 (yelling from the changing room) All right! I found one that fits!'
Rachel	 Well y\xc2\x92know what they say, the 23rd time\xc2\x92s the\ncharm. (Chandler enters.) Aww, look at you all handsome!'
Chandler	 Whose is it?'
Rachel	 Oh does it matter?! All that matters is that you look so handsome.'
Chandler	 Whose is it?'
Rachel	 I don\xc2\x92t want to say.'
Chandler	 Oh, come on! I don\xc2\x92t care! Come on! Whose is it?'
Rachel	 Diane Keeton.'
