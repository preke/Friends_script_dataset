Rachel	 Joey.'
Rachel	 (seeing the ring) Oh my God. (Pause) Okay.'
Rachel	 So uh\xc2\x85I guess we should\xc2\x85make it official huh?'
Joey	 Uh\xc2\x85 Look Rach\xc2\x85(Ross enters.) Hey Ross is here! Hey look!\nIt\xc2\x92s my good friend Ross. Hey Ross.'
Ross	 Hey Joey. (To Rachel) Hey you.'
Rachel	 Hey you.'
Joey	 Hey and look he brought flowers. Thanks Ross, but I\xc2\x92m really more of\na candy guy. (Laughs.)'
Ross	 You\xc2\x92re weird today. (He turns to Rachel and Joey puts the ring back.)\n(To Rachel) Listen I uh, wanted to talk to you about something.'
Rachel	 Uh yeah, actually I kinda need to talk to you too.'
Ross	 Uh Joey, can you give us just a minute?'
Joey	 No.'
Ross	 What?'
Joey	 Oh, I\xc2\x92m sorry. I meant no.'
Monica	 (entering with everyone else including Mr. Geller) Hi! Hey look\nwho\xc2\x92s here!'
Mr. Geller	 Where\xc2\x92s my granddaughter? I\xc2\x92ve been practicing my magic\ntricks.'
Chandler	 He pulled a quarter out of my ear!'
Ross	 Hey, where\xc2\x92s uh, where\xc2\x92s mom?'
Mr. Geller	 She went to pick up Aunt Liddy.'
Monica	 Oh, Aunt Liddy\xc2\x92s coming? That means we get five dollars each!'
Mr. Geller	 So when do I get to meet Emma and show her this? (Pulls a bouquet of\nflowers out of his sleeve.)'
Chandler	 Okay. Wow.'
Ross	 Uh Dad, Emma\xc2\x92s in the nursery. I\xc2\x92ll take you now. If you want,\nbut (To Rachel) I really want to talk to you.'
Rachel	 I know, I still need to talk to you.'
Joey	 Oh hey but, before you guys do that (To Rachel) I need to talk to you, and\nRoss, I need to talk to you.'
Phoebe	 (To Monica) Oh and I need to talk to you.'
Monica	 About what?'
Phoebe	 To see if know what these guys are talking about.'

Monica	 Isn\xc2\x92t she beautiful?'
Mr. Geller	 Look at her, my first grandchild.'
Ross	 What about Ben?'
Mr. Geller	 Well of course Ben, I meant my first granddaughter. (To Monica,\nmouths) Wow.'
Phoebe	 (taking Ross aside) Have umm, have you thought anymore about you and\nRachel?'
Ross	 Oh well yeah, actually I was going to talk to her when you guys all came\nin the room.'
Phoebe	 Yay! It\xc2\x92s so exciting! Wow, you could\xc2\x92ve done that with us\nthere.'
Ross	 Yeah right.'
Phoebe	 Oh sure okay, you can touch yourself in front of us but you can\xc2\x92t\ntalk to Rachel.'
Ross	 What?! When have I ever touched myself in front of you guys?'
Phoebe	 Oh please! Just before when you were asleep in the lounge! That Armenian\nfamily was watching you instead of the TV. Oh, that reminds me. That Mr. Hasmeje still has\nmy Gameboy.'
Joey	 (taking Chandler aside) Hey Chandler, can I talk to you for a second?'
Chandler	 Sure.'
Joey	 Dude I just did something terrible.'
Chandler	 That was you?! I thought it was Jack!'
Joey	 No! No, that was Jack! Rachel thinks I asked her to marry me!'
Chandler	 What?! Why does she think that?'
Joey	 Because it kinda looked like I did.'
Chandler	 Again, what?!'
Joey	 Okay well, I was down on one knee with the ring in my hand\xc2\x85'
Chandler	 As we all are at some point during the day.'
Joey	 It wasn\xc2\x92t my ring! It fell out of Ross\xc2\x92s jacket! And when I\nknelt down to pick it up Rachel thought I was proposing!'
Chandler	 Ross had a ring?! And he was gonna propose?'
Joey	 I guess.'
Chandler	 And you did it first?! This is gonna kill him! You know how much he\nloves to propose!'
Joey	 I know! I know it\xc2\x92s awful.'
Chandler	 Well, what did she say?'
Joey	 (happily) She said yes.'
Chandler	 Does Ross know?'
Joey	 Oh God, what the hell am I going to tell him?'
Chandler	 Well maybe you don\xc2\x92t have to tell him anything.'
Joey	 Oh, I like that. Yeah\xc2\x85'
Chandler	 If you clear things up with Rachel then Ross never needs to find out,\nbut you have to do it now before he hears about it and kicks your ass!'
Joey	 (laughs) Now let\xc2\x92s not get carried away. (He walks away as Monica\ncomes over and hugs Chandler from behind.)'
Monica	 I want a baby.'
Chandler	 Honey, we\xc2\x92ve been over this. I need to be facing the other way.'
Monica	 Come on! Come on, if we have sex again it\xc2\x92ll double our chances of\ngetting pregnant. Do you think that closet\xc2\x92s still available?'
Chandler	 I\xc2\x92m so tired. (She starts kissing him.) Yeah okay, but no\nforeplay.'
Monica	 Deal!'
Ross	 Dad seriously! Y\xc2\x92know you really should see someone about that!'
Mr. Geller	 Noted.'
Ross	 I wanna go talk to Rachel for a minute, are you gonna be okay alone for a\nbit?'
Mr. Geller	 Are you kidding me, I could stay and look at her forever.'
Ross	 (noticing something) Actually umm\xc2\x85 (He turns Mr. Geller\xc2\x92s head\nto look at Emma.)'
Phoebe	 Hey!'
Rachel	 Hi.'
Phoebe	 Are you all right?'
Rachel	 Uhh\xc2\x85 I think I just got engaged.'
Phoebe	 Oh my God! He did it?'
Rachel	 Well\xc2\x85did you know he was gonna ask me?'
Phoebe	 Are you kidding? I\xc2\x92m like the one who talked him into it. I like to\nthink of myself as the puppet master of the group.'
Rachel	 And you really think this is a good idea?'
Phoebe	 I just talked him into it, don\xc2\x92t tell me I have to do you too. The\npuppet master gets tired people.'
Rachel	 I just don\xc2\x92t know! It just doesn\xc2\x92t feel right.'
Phoebe	 Why?! You two are so meant to be together, everybody thinks so.'
Rachel	 Really?! Even Ross?'
Phoebe	 Especially Ross!'
Joey	 (entering) Oh uh, hey Pheebs. Uh y\xc2\x92know what? I\xc2\x92ll-I\xc2\x92ll\ncome back later. (He goes to leave but runs into Ross who\xc2\x92s entering.)'
Ross	 Wow! Kind of uh, kind of a full house here. I\xc2\x92ll guess\njust\xc2\x85I\xc2\x92ll come back. (Ross exits followed by Joey.)'
Phoebe	 There he goes, your fianc\xc3\xa9e. '
Rachel	 I guess so.'
Phoebe	 Although he does play with himself in his sleep.'
Rachel	 I can\xc2\x92t say that I\xc2\x92m surprised.'
Ross	 Dad, what are you doing?'
Mr. Geller	 I think there are people in there having sex.'
Joey	 It can\xc2\x92t be me, I\xc2\x92m standing right here.'
Mr. Geller	 Wanna peek?'
Ross	 No!'
Mr. Geller	 Come on!'
Ross	 Y\xc2\x92know what? I don\xc2\x92t like you without mom. (To Joey) Come on.\n(Walks away.)'
Joey	 (To Ross) We\xc2\x92re not peeking? (Follows him.)'
Mr. Geller	 Well I\xc2\x92m peeking. (He peeks.) Oh my God!'
Chandler	 Hello sir, you know Monica.'
Joey	 Hey uh, is it okay to come in?'
Rachel	 Of course! Oh Joey, this ring I\xc2\x85it\xc2\x92s beautiful I love it!'
Joey	 Yeah uh look Rach, there\xc2\x92s something I gotta tell ya.'
Rachel	 Hey!'
Nurse	 Hey! Are you ready to try nursing again?'
Rachel	 Yeah! Hi Emma. Hey, why do you think she won\xc2\x92t take my breast?'
Nurse	 It\xc2\x92s all right honey, it takes some babies a while to get it, but\ndon\xc2\x92t worry. It\xc2\x92ll happen.'
Joey	 (watching) Yowsa! (Looks away.)'
Rachel	 Okay sweetie, you can do it. Just open up and put it in your mouth.'
Joey	 Dear Lord.'
Rachel	 I\xc2\x92m sorry honey, what were you saying?'
Joey	 Oh uh-uh yeah, I think that\xc2\x85'
Rachel	 Oh look, she\xc2\x92s pulling away again! Do you think my nipples are too\nbig for her mouth? (Joey gets embarrassed.) She looks scared. Doesn\xc2\x92t she look\nscared?'
Joey	 Y\xc2\x92know, I don\xc2\x92t really know her.'
Nurse	 Why don\xc2\x92t we try massaging the breast to stimulate the flow. (Does\nso.)'
Joey	 (To God) Are you kidding me?!'
Rachel	 It\xc2\x92s just so frustrating! Why doesn\xc2\x92t she want my breast?!'
Joey	 I don\xc2\x92t know! Maybe she\xc2\x92s crazy! (Storms out.)'
Phoebe	 Oh hey! Wait up!'
Ross	 Hi!'
Phoebe	 Congratulations! I didn\xc2\x92t want to say anything in front of Joey\n\xc2\x91cause I didn\xc2\x92t know if he knew yet.'
Ross	 What, that we had a baby? Come on let\xc2\x92s give him a little credit,\nalthough, he did eat a piece of plastic fruit earlier.'
Phoebe	 No! No, that you and Rachel are engaged!'
Ross	 What?'
Phoebe	 Oh, it\xc2\x92s a secret. Oh goodie! Yes! We haven\xc2\x92t done the secret\nthing in a long time.'
Ross	 Phoebe, there is no secret. Okay? I didn\xc2\x92t propose.'
Phoebe	 Are you lying? Is this like that time you tried to convince us that you\nwere a doctor?'
Ross	 (pause) I am a doctor! Y\xc2\x92know what? I\xc2\x92m just gonna go and\ntalk to Rachel myself.'
Phoebe	 All right, me too. (They go into her room and see that she\xc2\x92s\nsleeping.) Should we wake her up?'
Ross	 No! No, come on let her sleep! She\xc2\x92s so exhausted.'
Phoebe	 And so engaged. (Points to the ring that Rachel is wearing.)'
Ross	 What? (Motions for Phoebe to go outside with him.) Oh my God! She-she\nthinks we\xc2\x92re engaged! Why? Why? Why would she think we\xc2\x92re engaged?!'
Phoebe	 Perhaps because you gave her an engagement ring? Y\xc2\x92know Ross\ndoctors are supposed to be smart.'
Ross	 I didn\xc2\x92t give her that ring!'
Phoebe	 Really?'
Ross	 No!'
Phoebe	 So whose ring is it?'
Ross	 It\xc2\x92s mine.'
Phoebe	 Is it an engagement ring?'
Ross	 Yes!'
Phoebe	 But you didn\xc2\x92t give it to her?'
Ross	 No!'
Phoebe	 But you were going to propose?'
Ross	 No!!'
Phoebe	 Huh, I might be losing interest in this.'
Ross	 Look. Look, my mom gave me that ring because she wanted me to propose to\nRachel, but all I wanted to do is if she maybe\xc2\x85kinda\xc2\x85wanted\nah\xc2\x85start\xc2\x85things up again.'
Phoebe	 Oh, what beautiful lukewarm sentiment.'
Ross	 Look, I didn\xc2\x92t want to rush into anything. And it seemed like she\ndidn\xc2\x92t want to either. But I don\xc2\x92t, I don\xc2\x92t understand how any of this\nhappened! What? Did she find the ring in my jacket, assume that I was going to propose,\nthrow it on, and-and just start telling people?'
Phoebe	 No! No, she said you actually proposed to her.'
Ross	 Well I didn\xc2\x92t! I didn\xc2\x92t propose! (Pause) Unless uh\xc2\x85 (Pause)\nDid I? I haven\xc2\x92t slept in forty hours and\xc2\x85it does sound like something I would\ndo.'

Chandler	 Look, we can\xc2\x92t stay in here forever.'
Monica	 Oh, I still can\xc2\x92t believe my dad saw us having sex! He didn\xc2\x92t\nmake it to one of piano recitals, but this he sees!'
Chandler	 This is okay. We\xc2\x92re all adults here; there\xc2\x92s nothing to be\nashamed of. Now, let\xc2\x92s put our underwear in our pockets and walk out the door. (They\ndo so and find Mr. Geller leaning against a wall stunned.)'
Monica	 Hi Dad! I can still call you that right?'
Mr. Geller	 Of course. I\xc2\x92ll always be your dad.'
Chandler	 I just want you to know that what you witnessed in there, that\nwasn\xc2\x92t for fun.'
Monica	 It wasn\xc2\x92t fun?!'
Chandler	 (To Monica) Why? Why-why-would you\xc2\x97Wh-why\xc2\x85 (To Mr. Geller)\nLook, I just don\xc2\x92t want you to think that we\xc2\x92re animals who do it whenever we\nwant.'
Mr. Geller	 Oh, I don\xc2\x92t think that. Before today I never thought of you two\nhaving sex at all. It was a simpler time.'
Monica	 The truth is, Dad, we\xc2\x92re-we\xc2\x92re trying.'
Mr. Geller	 What?'
Monica	 Yeah, we\xc2\x92re trying to get pregnant.'
Mr. Geller	 Oh my God! This is so exciting! Well, get back in there! (Points to\nthe closet) I\xc2\x92ll guard the door!'
Monica	 Well, that\xc2\x92s okay dad, we-we can wait until later.'
Mr. Geller	 Whoa-whoa-whoa! I don\xc2\x92t think so! Aren\xc2\x92t you ovulating?'
Monica	 Daddy?!'
Mr. Geller	 Well you gotta get at it princess! When your mother and I were\ntrying to conceive you, whenever she was ovulating, bam, we did it. That\xc2\x92s how I got\nmy bad hip.'
Chandler	 That\xc2\x92s funny, this conversation\xc2\x92s how I got the bullet hole\nin my head.'
Mr. Geller	 This one time I had my knee up on the sink and your mother, she\nwas\xc2\x85'
Monica	 Daddy! I don\xc2\x92t think we need to hear about the specific positions\nyou and mom had sex.'
Mr. Geller	 You\xc2\x92re right, you\xc2\x92re right. This is about your positions.\nNow, what I saw in the closet is not the optimum position for conceiving a child, although\nit might feel good.'
Monica	 I don\xc2\x92t feel good right now.'
Mr. Geller	 But pleasure is important, (To Chandler) and it helps if the woman\nhas an orgasm. You up to the task sailor?'
Chandler	 Seriously sir, my brains? All over the wall.'
Monica	 Hey.'
Rachel	 Hey. I need to tell you something.'
Monica	 Well, now\xc2\x92s a good time. I\xc2\x92m on my way to have my ears cut\noff.'
Rachel	 Joey asked me marry him.'
Monica	 What?'
Rachel	 Joey proposed to me.'
Monica	 Is he crazy?! You just had Ross\xc2\x92s baby!'
Rachel	 Well, I-I said yes.'
Monica	 What?! Are you crazy? You just had Ross\xc2\x92s baby! It\xc2\x92s-it\xc2\x92s\nso inappropriate. No, it\xc2\x92s worse than that. It\xc2\x92s wrong. It\xc2\x92s\xc2\x85 It is\nbigger than mine! (Rachel\xc2\x92s engagement ring.)'
Rachel	 I know. Days of Our Lives, thank you very much.'
Monica	 You can\xc2\x92t marry him!'
Rachel	 Why not? I don\xc2\x92t want to do this alone! And he\xc2\x92s such a sweet\nguy and he loves me so much.'
Monica	 Well do you love him?'
Rachel	 Sure.'
Monica	 Sure?'
Rachel	 Yeah, I mean whatever.'
Monica	 Honey, the question is\xc2\x85do you really want to marry Joey?'
Rachel	 No. No, I don\xc2\x92t. Could you be a dear and go tell him?'
Chandler	 You still haven\xc2\x92t told Rachel you weren\xc2\x92t really proposing?'
Joey	 No! She had the ring on, she seemed so excited, and then she took her\nbreast out.'
Chandler	 Joey, you have to tell her what\xc2\x92s going on! And what did it look\nlike?!'
Joey	 I didn\xc2\x92t look at it. Stupid baby\xc2\x92s head was blocking most of it.'
Chandler	 Go and tell Rachel right now before Ross finds out.'
Joey	 Look, it\xc2\x92s not that easy. She said she wanted to marry me. I\ndon\xc2\x92t want to hurt her.'
Chandler	 Okay, look, just do it gently.'
Joey	 You\xc2\x92re right. You\xc2\x92re right. I-I\xc2\x92ll go tell her now before\nRoss finds out and I\xc2\x92ll be gentle. I can do that. I am a gentle person. Oh, by the\nway. Two people screwing in there (Points to the closet Chandler and Monica were in) if\nyou want to check that out.'
Ross	 Hey.'
Rachel	 Hey.'
Ross	 Listen, I um\xc2\x85 I heard about the engagement.'
Rachel	 Surprised?'
Ross	 And confused. Rach, sweetie, I-I um\xc2\x85I didn\xc2\x92t propose to you.'
Rachel	 I know.'
Ross	 I don\xc2\x92t think you do.'
Rachel	 You didn\xc2\x92t propose to me. Joey did.'
Ross	 Poor baby, you\xc2\x92re so tired. Rach, I didn\xc2\x92t propose to you, Joey\ndidn\xc2\x92t propose to you, and Chandler didn\xc2\x92t propose to you.'
Rachel	 Uh\xc2\x85 You didn\xc2\x92t propose to me, Chandler didn\xc2\x92t propose to\nme, but Joey did.'
Ross	 Joey proposed to you?'
Joey	 I can come back.'
Ross	 Hey, wait! Wait-wait-wait! Joey, did you propose to her?'
Joey	 No.'
Rachel	 Yes you did!'
Joey	 Actually, technically, I didn\xc2\x92t.'
Rachel	 Well then why did you give me a ring?'
Ross	 Wait! Whoa-whoa, you\xc2\x85you gave her the ring?'
Joey	 No! No, and I did not ask her to marry me!'
Rachel	 Yes, you did!'
Joey	 No, I didn\xc2\x92t!'
Rachel	 Yes, you did!'
Joey	 No, I didn\xc2\x92t!'
Rachel	 Yes, you did! And don\xc2\x92t you say, "No, I didn\xc2\x92t!"'
Joey	 Ahhh!'
Rachel	 He was right there. He got down on one knee and proposed.'
Ross	 Whoa! You were down on one knee?'
Joey	 Yeah. Yeah, that looks bad. But I didn\xc2\x92t\xc2\x85I didn\xc2\x92t propose!'
Ross	 Then what did happen?'
Rachel	 Yeah, what did happen?'
Joey	 Okay, the ring fell on the floor and I went down to pick it up and you\nthought I was proposing.'
Rachel	 Yeah, but you said, "Will you marry me?"'
Joey	 No, I didn\xc2\x92t!'
Rachel	 Yes, you did!'
Joey	 No, I didn\xc2\x92t!'
Rachel	 Yes, you did\xc2\x97Oh my God you didn\xc2\x92t! (Screams) Well then why\ndidn\xc2\x92t you tell me that before?!'
Joey	 Well I tried, but people kept coming in and then you took your breast out!'
Ross	 Whoa! Hey! Whoa-whoa-whoa, you saw her breast?!'
Joey	 (To Ross) I\xc2\x92ll tell you about it later. Be cool.'
Rachel	 Well then Joey, what the hell were you doing with an engagement ring?!'
Joey	 It wasn\xc2\x92t my ring! It\xc2\x92s Ross\xc2\x92s ring! That\xc2\x92s why I felt\nso bad Rach, because he was going to propose.'
Ross	 What?!'
Rachel	 You were gonna propose to me?'
Ross	 Uhh\xc2\x85 No.'
Joey	 Well, this is awkward. {See? I told you so.}'
Ross	 But I-I was going to see if y\xc2\x92know, maybe you uh, start dating again\nbut that\xc2\x97I mean that-that was all, Rach.'
Joey	 Dude, step up! I proposed.'
Ross	 No, you didn\xc2\x92t!'
Joey	 Oh that\xc2\x92s right. There\xc2\x92s a lot going on here and I think I ate\nsome bad fruit earlier.'
Nurse	 Hey, she just woke up! She\xc2\x92s hungry. Why don\xc2\x92t we give this\nanother try?'
Rachel	 Okay.'
Ross	 (To Joey) I can\xc2\x92t believe you told her I was going to propose!'
Joey	 I can\xc2\x92t believe you\xc2\x92re not going to propose!'
Ross	 Hey, I\xc2\x92m not going to rush into anything!'
Joey	 Oh yeah, dude, I totally understand. Usually after I have a baby with a\nwoman I like to slow things down!'
Rachel	 Oh my God!'
Ross	 What?'
Rachel	 She\xc2\x92s doing it Look, she\xc2\x92s breast-feeding look!'
Joey	 (looking at the ceiling) Ah, it\xc2\x92s beautiful.'
Nurse	 I\xc2\x92ll come back for her later.'
Rachel	 Okay.'
Ross	 Thank you. (The nurse exits.)'
Rachel	 Oh wow, this feels weird.'
Ross	 Good weird?'
Rachel	 Wonderful weird.'
Joey	 Y\xc2\x92know what you guys? I\xc2\x92m uh, I\xc2\x92m gonna go too. And uh,\nI\xc2\x92m sorry about everything.'
Rachel	 Honey don\xc2\x92t worry, it was my mistake.'
Joey	 No, Rach, I should\xc2\x92ve told you sooner. It\xc2\x92s just that\xc2\x85Man!\nThat kid is going to town! (Joey makes his awkward exit.)'
Rachel	 She\xc2\x92s perfect.'
Ross	 We\xc2\x92re so lucky.'
Rachel	 We really are.'
Ross	 Look, I-I know it\xc2\x92s not a proposal and I don\xc2\x92t know where you\nare, but with everything that\xc2\x92s been going on and with Emma and\xc2\x85I\xc2\x92ve been\nfeeling\xc2\x85'
Rachel	 I know. I know. I\xc2\x92ve feeling\xc2\x85'
Ross	 Yeah?'
Rachel	 Yeah. (Laughs nervously)'
Ross	 Okay, well, that\xc2\x85 Wow, okay, well, umm\xc2\x85then maybe, at least we\ncan, we can talk about us again.'
Rachel	 Yeah, maybe.'
Ross	 Well good, okay. I-I, kind of think y\xc2\x92know if we\xc2\x85if\xc2\x85\nYou\xc2\x92re wearing the ring.'
Rachel	 Wh-what\xc2\x92s that?'
Ross	 And you told Phoebe you were engaged.'
Rachel	 I\xc2\x92m sorry, what?'
Ross	 When you thought Joey proposed did\xc2\x85did you say yes?'

Mr. Geller	 Kids, I spoke to a doctor and picked up this pamphlets on how to get\npregnant. (He slides them under the door.)'
Monica	 (walking by with Chandler.) Hey dad!'
Chandler	 Hey.'
Mr. Geller	 (pause) Sorry to bother you again, but could you pass my pamphlets\nback? (They do so.) Thank you.'
