Gary	 (To Phoebe) Would you like some more coffee, baby-doll?'
Phoebe	 I'm fine, thanks."
Chandler	 (To Monica) Yeah, see, I can't pull of baby-doll can I?"
Monica	 No. I think we learned that from the sugarlips incident. I'm gonna get\nsome tea."
Chandler	 Okay.'
Chandler	 Hiya doin' pumpkin?"
Phoebe	 Nope. (Chandler nods in agreement.)'
Monica	 So it looks like it's going really well for you two, huh?"
Gary	 I know, really well. In fact, I'm gonna ask Phoebe to move in with me."
Monica	 (shocked) Oh my God!'
Gary	 What do you, what do you think?'
Monica	 I think that is so great! When are you gonna ask her?'
Gary	 Tonight, but don't say anything. Okay?"
Monica	 I swear, I promise. I promise. Oh my God, I'm so excited! {And I just\ncan't hide it! I'm about to lose control and I think I like it! Sorry, just\ncouldn't resist it.} All right, listen let me tell you, do not get her flowers.\nOkay? Because y'know, she cries when they die, and there's the whole funeral\xc2\x85"
Gary	 (To Phoebe) I'll see you after work sweetie. (Kisses her.)"
Phoebe	 Okay. Bye! '
Phoebe	 So, what movie should we see?'
Monica	 (sitting down) Gary's gonna ask you to move in with him!!"
Phoebe	 What?! Really?!'
Monica	 He just told me at the counter. He made me promise not to tell, but I\ncouldn't hold it in any longer!"
Phoebe	 I can't believe this!"
Chandler	 (terrified) Right, because it's fast. Because, it's so fast. It's\nfast!"
Monica	 Relax! It's Phoebe! Not you!"
Chandler	 Oh! Good for you Pheebs, way to go! (Breathes a sigh of relief)'
Phoebe	 No, but it is fast. Isn't it?"
Monica	 Ohhhh!'
Phoebe	 No, I like him a lot but I don't think I'm ready for this!"
Chandler	 So, what are you gonna do?'
Phoebe	 I don't know. I'll just handle it\xc2\x97I'll ask you to talk to him!"
Chandler	 Me?! Why me?'
Phoebe	 Because you are so afraid of commitment! You talk to him, make him\nscared like you! Make him a\xc2\x85man!'
Chandler	 I'll try, but I'm not sure what good it would do, y'know? Because I'm\na lot less afraid of commitment than I used to be."
Monica	 That is so sweet! (She kisses him and turns to add some sugar to her\ntea.)'
Chandler	 (To Phoebe, behind Monica's back) Still terrified, I'll take care of\nit. No problem. (When Monica turns back he smiles and kisses her, when she turns away he\nnods that he'll do it to Phoebe.)"

Joey	 Hey Ross, is uh, is Staten Island really an island?'
Ross	 Uh-huh, that's why they call it Staten Island."
Joey	 Ohhh. I thought it was like Long Island.'
Ross	 (he catches the ball and pauses, staring at Joey in disbelief) Also an\nisland.'
Joey	 Hey, what time is it?'
Ross	 (looks at his watch) 2
Joey	 Wow! You realize that we've been throwing this ball, without dropping it,\nfor like an hour?"
Ross	 Are you serious?!'
Joey	 Yeah. I realized it about a half-hour ago but I didn't want to say\nanything 'cause I didn't want to jinx it."
Ross	 Wow! We are pretty good at this! Hey! We totally forgot about lunch!'
Joey	 Oh, I-I, I think that's the first time I ever missed a meal! (Checks his\npants.) Yeah, my pants are a little loose!"
Rachel	 (entering) Hey, you guys\xc2\x85'
Joey	 Hey!'
Rachel	 Is Monica here?'
Joey and Ross	 No.'
Rachel	 All right listen umm, I just bought something I'm not sure she's gonna\nlike it, and it's gonna seem a little crazy, but this is something that I wanted since I\nwas a little girl."
Ross	 You bought Shawn Cassidy!'
Rachel	 Noo! I wish! Okay, you ready? '
Joey and Ross	 Yeah!'
Rachel	 Okay! (She goes and gets her surprise and when she returns with it, Ross\nstares in shock.) Check it out!'
Ross	 What-what is it?!'
Joey	 What the hell is that?!!'
Rachel	 It's a, it's a cat!"
Joey	 That, is not a cat! {I have to agree with Joey on this one.}'
Rachel	 Yes it is!'
Ross	 Why is it inside out?!'
Rachel	 Excuse me! But this is a purebred, show-quality Sphinx cat!'
Ross	 How much did you pay for that?'
Rachel	 Well, it was a little extravagant, but I a pretty good deal.'
Ross	 Yeah? How much?'
Rachel	 A thousand bucks.'
Ross	 ON A CAT??!!!!'
Joey	 It's not a cat!"
Rachel	 All right listen ball boys! My grandmother had one of these when I was a\nlittle girl and it was the sweetest thing! I mean it was so cute, it would sit in my lap\nand purr all day long, and I would drag a shoestring on the ground and he would chase it!'
Ross	 Free cats do that too, y'know. {Which reminds me, if I might get a little\npolitical here, support your local animal shelter. Pet shops are not the place to\nbuy dogs and cats from, you get a much better deal from the shelter, plus they probably\nwon't die on you in a week and a half. If you want a leash, go to the pet shop. If you\nwant the dog for that leash, go to the shelter and save it's life. Now back to regularly\nscheduled programming.}"
Joey	 It's not a cat!"
Rachel	 Ugh! Look you guys, I'm really excited about this! Okay? I don't care\nwhat you think! I'm gonna go set up a little litter box for Mrs. Whiskerson. (They both\nglare at her.) Well, what am I gonna call her? Fluffy?!"
Ross	 (To Joey) Hey, you wanna get something to eat or uh, do you wanna see how\nlong we can throw this ball back and forth? Huh?'
Joey	 Uhh, the ball thing.'
Ross	 Yeah?'
Joey	 Hey Ross, wouldn't it be great if we could go two straight hours without\ndropping it?!"
Ross	 Uhh, yeah it would! Let's do it!"
Joey	 Okay!'
Joey	 (catches the ball) Uh-oh.'
Ross	 What?'
Joey	 I have to pee. And Rachel's in the bathroom!"
Joey	 Man, I didn't think we were gonna make it!"
Ross	 I know! (Looks at the ball in his hands.) Don't switch hands, okay?"
Chandler	 Hey ladies! What are you in here for? (Laughs at his joke.)'
Gary	 Hey Chandler, what are you doing here?'
Chandler	 Gary, I'm here to report a crime."
Gary	 Yeah?'
Chandler	 It is a crime that you and I don't spend more time together."
Gary	 (laughs, then suddenly serious) What's up?"
Chandler	 Well, I heard that you thinking about asking Phoebe to move in with\nyou and I thought maybe, we should have a talk. Man to uh, me.'
Gary	 Sure. Okay.'
Chandler	 Uh, are you crazy? Are you insane? If you live with Phoebe, you two\nare gonna be y'know, live-living together!"
Gary	 Yeah, I-I considered that. I just know it would make me happy.'
Chandler	 You mean scared.'
Gary	 No, I mean happy.'
Chandler	 Scared? Happy?'
Gary	 Chandler, what-what are you doing?'
Chandler	 I am trying to open your eyes, my man! Don't you see, if you lived\nwith Phoebe she's always gonna be there. You're gonna get home, she's there. You go to\nbed, she's there. You wake up and oh yes, she's there!"
Gary	 I know! I can't wait!"
Chandler	 Were you're parents happy, or something?"
Gary	 Listen Chandler, the way I see it is that I was lucky enough to find\nsomeone that I really love. I just\xc2\x97I wanna be around her as much as I can.'
Chandler	 Wow, y'know when you say it, it doesn't sound so scary."
Gary	 So you know what I'm talking about, right?"
Chandler	 Yeah, I think I do! Y'know what? You move in with her! You move in\nwith her right now! Maybe I should in with Monica!"
Gary	 No, it's too soon for you guys."
Chandler	 (pause) Yeah, you're right about that."
Ross	 \xc2\x85now when they found the remains of the Mesozoic Mastodon they\ndiscovered what appeared to be the remains of a Paleozoic Amphibian in its jaws!\nHow did it get there?!'
Joey	 Maybe this should be more of a quiet game.'

Monica	 (entering) Hey guys!'
Joey	 Hi!'
Monica	 Joey, I left my watch on the counter last night. (Goes to the counter)\nIt was right here, where is it?'
Joey	 I don't know."
Monica	 All right, come on, I'm-I'm late for work!"
Ross	 How do you know? You don't have a watch."
Monica	 Guys, could you please just stop throwing the ball for one minute and\njust help me find it!'
Joey	 Oh, I don't know\xc2\x85. Yeah, can't do it."
Monica	 What?!'
Ross	 Monica, whatever you do, do not drop that ball!'
Joey	 Yeah, we haven't dropped it in\xc2\x85 (Looks to Ross.)"
Ross	 2 hours, 27 minutes.'
Monica	 Really?!'
Monica	 (on phone, faking she's sick) I-I'm not gonna be able to make it into\nwork today, I don't feel very good. (Joey makes a high throw and Monica has to catch it\nway over her head.) (Not sounding sick) Yes!! (Realizes what she just did.) (Sounding sick\nagain) Wow! Uh, for a second there I thought I was really better, but I'm not. (Hangs up\nand keeps throwing the ball.)"
Ross	 Hey Rach!'
Rachel	 Hey.'
Ross	 Check it out! Almost 3 hours without droppin' it!"
Rachel	 Oh, wow! Congratulations, that's quite a waste of time."
Monica	 Rach?'
Rachel	 Yeah?'
Monica	 You have scratches all over you, what happened? (Rachel's arms are\ncovered with scratches.)"
Rachel	 Well, it's my cat."
Monica	 (shocked) What?!'
Rachel	 Oh yeah, I got a cat.'
Monica	 I don't want a cat!"
Joey	 Oh, don't worry, it's not a cat."
Ross	 Yeah.'
Rachel	 You guys this cat is nothing like my grandmother\'s cat. I mean,\nit\'s not sweet, it\'s not cute, I even dragged that little string on the ground, and it\njust flipped out and scratched the hell out of me. And I swear, I know this sounds crazy,\nbut every time this cat hisses at me I know it\'s saying, "Rachel!"'
Ross	 Doesn't sound as crazy as paying a thousand dollars for a cat."
Monica	 (To Rachel) What?! You paid a thousand dollars for a cat when you owe me\n300!!'
Rachel	 Well, I was gonna let you play with it.'
Chandler	 Hi!'
Phoebe	 Hmm, did you talk to Gary about the moving in thing?'
Chandler	 Yes I did, and I think you should do it.'
Phoebe	 What?!'
Chandler	 He's a great guy, y'know? And he loves you a lot, you are a very lucky\nlady."
Phoebe	 You are useless! Freaking out about commitment is the one thing\nyou can do! The one thing! And you can't even do that right! God!"
Chandler	 I\xc2\x92m sorry. (Pause) If you ask me, I'd move in with him."
Phoebe	 Ohh!! God! (Gary enters and she sees him) Ooh! (To Chandler) Get out of\nhere, good for nothing.'
Gary	 Hey Chandler.'
Chandler	 Hey Gar!'
Gary	 (To Phoebe) Hi sweetie. (Kisses her.) Hi, can I talk to you for a second?'
Phoebe	 Yeah! Okay. (They move to the couch.)'
Gary	 You look very pretty today.'
Phoebe	 Thanks! Okay. (They sit down.)'
Gary	 Here's the thing."
Phoebe	 Yeah?'
Gary	 Y'know I really want to move this relationship forward."
Phoebe	 Uh-hmm.'
Gary	 Because if you're not moving forward, y'know you're just moving backwards."
Phoebe	 No that's not true. If you're not moving forward, you're just staying\nstill. And staying still is good. Watch this. (She stays still for a brief second.) "
Gary	 Phoebe?'
Phoebe	 Yeah?'
Gary	 I want you to move in with me.'
Phoebe	 That is so sweet. But don't you think it's a little too soon? I mean\nthere's so much we don't know about each other."
Gary	 (disappointed) Oh. Oh-oh-okay, I get it.'
Phoebe	 I just\xc2\x97I don't want us to jump into something we're not ready for."
Gary	 (disappointed more) Uh-huh.'
Phoebe	 I really don't want to mess up what we have. I'm just\xc2\x97I'm worried\nit's gonna be a big mistake."
Gary	 (on the verge of tears) Yeah.'
Phoebe	 Which is why my answer is yes!'
Gary	 (suddenly happy) Really?!'
Phoebe	 Uh-huh! (They hug.) I'm so\xc2\x85happy. (She's not happy.)"

Ross	 (catching the ball) Monica! Stop throwing it so hard! We're on the same\nteam!"
Chandler	 Four hours? You guys have been doing this for four hours?'
Joey	 That's right baby."
Chandler	 All right, let me in. (He jumps off of the counter to join in the\ngame.)'
Monica	 (jumping in front of him) No-no! Don't do it! Don't!"
Chandler	 What?'
Monica	 He's a dropper!"
Joey	 Oh yeah, that's right!"
Chandler	 I'm not a dropper!"
Ross	 It's really a uh-uh three person game, y'know?"
Chandler	 It's throwing and catching!"
Ross	 All right. (He gently tosses the ball to Chandler who catches it.)'
Chandler	 Oh! Oh! That's so hard. (Starts to juggle the ball, but loses control\nand almost drops it and hands it to Monica.)"
Joey	 Whoa-whoa you guys, it's not a cat!"
Monica	 Oh my\xc2\x97Oh good God!'
Rachel	 (she's wearing an oven mitt to protect her hand) I give up you guys, I\ndon't know what I'm going to do with this thing!"
Ross	 Baking it didn't help, huh?"
Monica	 So, why don't you just take it back to where you got it?"
Rachel	 I tried! They won't take her back."
Chandler	 Maybe that's because she's a minion of the anti-Christ."
Monica	 Rach, why won't they take it back?"
Rachel	 Well, they said would but they would only give me store credit. I mean,\nwhat am I going to do, get a thousand regular cats?'
Monica	 Look, if you want you can keep it at our place until you find out what\nto do with it.'
Rachel	 No Mon that's not the point. I'm out a thousand dollars, I'm all\nscratched up, and I'm stuck with this stupid cat that looks like a hand! (Storms out.)"
Monica	 Oh my God, the cat's made my eyes water! Don't-don't throw it to me! My\nvision's been compromised!! (Quickly grabs a tissue to wipe her eyes.) Oh God! Okay. Okay.\nIt's okay. Man, that was close."
Chandler	 Yeah, you almost overreacted to something.'
Phoebe and Gary	 (entering) Hey!'
All	 Hey!'
Gary	 We have great news!'
Phoebe	 We're moving in together! Isn't it great! Yay!"
All	 Congratulations! Congrats!'
Phoebe	 I know, I'm so excited!"
Gary	 So am I!'
Phoebe	 Well, you're not more excited than I am! No way! I'm the most\nexcited!"
Gary	 Okay, I'll see you at the station later."
Phoebe	 Okay, yeah, I'll see you later! Don't forget about the moving in!"
Gary	 All right.'
Monica	 So you're moving in with him. What happened?"
Phoebe	 I couldn't tell him no. He got so sad. Maybe it'll be all right. I do\nreally like him a lot and probably do it eventually anyway and plus, think of all the\nmoney I'll save on stamps."
Monica	 Why, do you write him a lot?'
Phoebe	 No, I just heard when people live together, they split the cost of\nstamps. Don't they?"
All	 Yeah! That's right. Yeah-yeah! Yeah!"
Phoebe	 Oh, I'm sorry, the oven mitts really freaked me out."
Gary	 Hey, honey! Okay, so did you find any apartments? Anything in Brooklyn\nHeights?'
Phoebe	 No, nothing.'
Gary	 Oh really?'
Phoebe	 Yeah.'
Gary	 Nothing at all?'
Phoebe	 No, as soon as something opens up we'll move right in. Unless it doesn't\nhave a pool, I need a pool. (Turns away from him.)"
Gary	 Phoebe, can I talk to you for a second?'
Phoebe	 Uh-huh!'
Gary	 Take a seat. You okay? You feeling all right? (Closes the door and takes\noff his coat.)'
Phoebe	 (sits down) Yeah, I feel great. 'Cause we're moving in together."
Gary	 So you uh, you checked the paper for listings in Brooklyn Heights, right?\nYou-you checked the Post?'
Phoebe	 Yeah, uh-huh, there was nothing. (Pause) Can I get some water?'
Gary	 In a minute. You-you checked today's Post?"
Phoebe	 Umm, yeah! Today's."
Gary	 'Cause uh, this is today's Post (produces one from the other chair)\nand uh, these are the listings I found. (Points) Brooklyn Heights, two bedroom. (Points)\nBrooklyn Heights, one bedroom. (Points) Brooklyn Heights, (points) Brooklyn Heights,\n(points) Brooklyn Heights!"
Phoebe	 (looks at the paper) Are these for rent! I thought people were just\nbragging!'
Gary	 Let me tell you what I think might be going on. (Phoebe looks down in\nshame.) No-no-no, don\'t look at the table. Look at me. (Points to his eyes and she does\nso) Okay, I think somebody asked someone to move in with them. And I think someone said,\n"Yes" but now she\'s having doubts because things are moving to fast for someone.\nDoes that sound at all possible to you?'
Phoebe	 Yes. Yes! Fine! I am someone! You want me to say it? I have\ndoubts! (Pause) I'm sorry! (Puts her head down.)"
Gary	 Phoebe\xc2\x85'
Phoebe	 Yeah?'
Gary	 Phoebe, it's okay that you feel this way. I mean it is soon. And\nthere's a lot of things we don't know about each other, and I just figure that everything\nI really like. And the things I don't know, I get to learn about at someplace with both\nour names on the mailbox."
Phoebe	 That's so sweet."
Gary	 Sweethart, but none of that matters if it's too soon for you. It's fine!\nWe don't have to move in together. I just\xc2\x97I want you to be happy"
Phoebe	 Living with you would make me happy.'
Gary	 Phoebe, you don't have to say that."
Phoebe	 No, I really wanna live with you! I wanna move in with you!'
Gary	 Are you sure?'
Phoebe	 Yes. Definitely! Yes! Let's live in an apartment that we both live in!\n(Hugs him.) "
Gary	 Oh that's great!"
Phoebe	 Oh wait, one sec. One sec. (Goes to the mirror) Hey you! Behind the\nglass! Who are you looking at! I've always wanted to say that when I was in one of these\nrooms, (sees the look on his face) which was never!"
Rachel	 Show cat! Quality show cat! Show cat! (A woman approaches.)'
Woman No. 1	 (looks into the box) Oh my God! What's wrong with your baby?!"
Rachel	 It's not a baby! It's a cat!"
Woman No. 1	 Eew! It's creepy looking!"
Rachel	 Oh no! No! It's actually\xc2\x97it's very sweet. It's very sweet. Look!\n(Goes to pet it and it hisses at her.) Yeah, do you want it?"
Woman No. 1	 (laughs) No, I hate cats.'
Rachel	 Well, so then what are you doing to me? Okay? Just get out of here! All\nright? Move on!'
Woman No. 2	 Wow! What an unusual cat!'
Rachel	 Yes! Thank you! Exactly! You want it?'
Woman No. 2	 Maybe. I was thinking about getting a cat, I was just going to go\nto the shelter (Good for her) but\xc2\x85 Okay, why not?'
Rachel	 Oh, terrific! That'll be $2,000."
Woman No. 2	 What?!'
Rachel	 Okay, a thousand.'
Woman No. 2	 I thought you wanted to adopt your cat.'
Rachel	 Well, I do, but you're just gonna have to actually look at this as more\nof an investment than a cat."
Woman No. 2	 Okay, yeah, I just wanted a cat. (Starts to leave.)'
Rachel	 (makes some unintelligible sound to stop her from leaving) Obviously you\nknow how to haggle, so I'm not gonna try and take you on. Okay? So $800 and I don't call\nthe cops because you're robbing me blind! Blind! (Covers her eyes) Just take cat, leave\nthe money, and run away! Run away! (Uncovers her eyes and sees that the woman has fled)\nDamnit! (To the cat) Cat, can't you at least smile or something?! (The cat hisses at her\nagain, it sounds like Rachel) Okay, did anybody just hear that? Anybody?"
[Scene	 Chandler and Joey's, Joey, Ross, Monica, and now Chandler are still playing\ncatch. The guys are exhausted and sitting around the room. Monica is still standing all\npumped up and being hyper-competitive yet again. {Okay! We get it! She's competitive!!\nMust we see all the time?!}]"
Ross	 I'm starving! "
Monica	 Come on guys! Suck it up! We're closing in on ten hours! It's gut-check\ntime!"
Joey	 I don't know who made you the boss? All right? We (Ross and him) invented\nthis game!"
Monica	 Please! I made this game what it is.'
Chandler	 Not fun anymore?'
Ross	 I'm still hungry! "
Monica	 All right, there's some pizza at my place, we can all eat with one hand\nright? Are you with me?"
Ross	 I am!'
Monica	 All right! Let's go! (Runs to the door.) Let's go Team Monica! (The guys\nall stop and stare at her) All right, we can work out the name later."
Monica	 Rachel! What is your cat doing in one of my bowls!'
Rachel	 It's not! I'm defrosting a chicken. (Pause) Oh, I uh sold Mrs.\nWhiskerson."
Ross	 Oh, thank God!'
Joey	 Did you get your money back?'
Rachel	 Yeah, 15 hundred dollars.'
Monica	 Wow! You made a profit!'
Gunther	 (entering with the cat) I just came for the red-velvet pillow.'
Rachel	 Oh yeah, there you go. (Hands over the pillow.)'
Gunther	 Thanks Rachel. And-and don't forget you-you can come visit her anytime\nyou want."
Rachel	 Oh good, great! I'll-I'll keep that in mind. (Turns and walks away.)"
Gunther	 (To Ross) Hey! So what is this? Some kind of snake or something?'
Gary	 I really like waking up with you.'
Phoebe	 I like waking up with you too. (Looks out the window) Oh! It's such a\nbeautiful morning. (Some birds are singing outside the window) Oh, I can stay here all\nday."
Gary	 That would be great!'
Phoebe	 We could have breakfast in bed\xc2\x85'
Gary	 Wait, just a second. '
Phoebe	 Okay. (He grabs his gun and shoots the bird.) Oh! Oh no.'
Monica	 All right! Come on Monica! Look alive! Come on, look alive!'
Phoebe	 (entering) Oh good, you're all up."
Rachel	 Phoebe! It's 6 o'clock in the morning! Why aren't you at Gary's?"
Phoebe	 Oh yeah, that's over."
All	 What?!'
Chandler	 Come on! Gary's such a great guy! Whatever the problem is, you can\nwork it out!"
Phoebe	 He shot a bird!'
Chandler	 Oh that is over!'
All	 That's terrible! I'm sorry!"
Rachel	 Phoebe, are you okay?'
Phoebe	 Yeah. Yeah, I'll be alright."
Joey	 Oh hey, here Pheebs. (He throws her the ball.)'
Phoebe	 (catches it) Nah, I don't feel like playing. (She sets the ball down on\nthe table and everyone gasps.)"
Monica	 It's okay. It's okay. Just pretend that it didn't happen! Okay? No one\nneeds to know! I mean, Phoebe's not an official ballplayer! I mean, only official\nballplayers can drop the ball!"
All	 All right. Okay. I'm starving! (They all get up, thus officially ending the\ngame.)"
Rachel	 Phoebe, honey, wanna get some breakfast?'
Phoebe	 Yeah!'
Monica	 Okay! Okay, let's race! First one there wins! Ha-ha! (Runs out the door\nand everyone watches her leave.)"
Chandler	 You guys wanna eat here?'
All	 Yeah! As long as we're here!"

Joey	 Man that was great! Huh? Can you believe how long we threw that ball\naround?'
Rachel	 Yeah, it is amazing it lasted that long.'
Ross	 I know. My arm is killing me.'
Rachel	 No, I meant with the dropper over here. (Points at Chandler.)'
Chandler	 Y'know, how did I get this reputation as a dropper? Okay? I'm anything\nbut a dropper. (We see various scenes of him dropping a football, a mug of coffee, the\nphone, an apple, a Frisbee, a record, and the final scene has a ball bouncing off of his\nchest. I'm not going to describe them, you'll have to see them.)"
