Monica	 (entering from her bedroom carrying a present) Ok, these were\nunbelievably expensive, and I know he's gonna grow out of them in like, 20 minutes, but I\ncouldn't resist. (There a little pair of Nike shoes.)"
Phoebe	 Oh, look at these! Hey, Ben. Just do it. (Ben starts to cry) Oh my God,\noh, ok, was that too much pressure for him?'
Susan	 Oh, is he hungry already?'
Carol	 I guess so. (Carol starts to breast feed Ben.)'
Chandler	 You know, it's... (sees the feeding taking place next to him)\nsomething funny about sneakers. I'll be right back. (Goes into the kitchen)"
Joey	 (joins him) I gotta get one, too.'
Ross	 (following them into the kitchen) What are you guys doing?'
Chandler	 We're just hanging out by the spoons. Ladle?"
Ross	 Look, would you guys grow up? That is the most natural beautiful thing in\nthe world.'
Joey	 Yeah, we know, but there's a baby suckin' on it."
Ross	 This is my son having lunch, ok? It's gonna happen a lot, so you'd better\nget used to it. Now if you have any problem with it, if you're uncomfortable, just ask\nquestions. Carol's fine with it, now come on."
Ross	 Carol?'
Chandler	 Carol? I was just wondering if Joey could ask you a question about\nbreast-feeding?'
Carol	 Sure.'
Joey	 Uh, does it hurt?'
Carol	 It did at first, but not anymore.'
Joey	 Chandler?'
Chandler	 So, uh, how often can you do it?'
Carol	 As much as he needs.'
Joey	 Ok, I got one, I got one. Uh, if he blows into one, does the other one get\nbigger?'

Julie	 Rachel, do you have any muffins left?'
Rachel	 Yeah, I forget which ones.'
Julie	 Oh, you're busy, that's ok, I'll get it. Anybody else want one? "
All	 No thanks.'
Julie	 (To Rachel) Oh, you're losin' your apron here, let me get it. There you\ngo. (Ties it back up for her)"
Rachel	 (to Julie) Thank you. (under her breath to Chandler) What a bitch.'
Julie	 Oh, listen you guys. I have this friend at Bloomingdale's who's\nquitting tomorrow and he wants to abuse his discount. So, anyone want to come with me and\ntake advantage of it?"
Phoebe	 I can't, I have to take my grandmother to the vet."
Monica	 Ok, um, I'll go with you. "
Julie	 Great.'
Ross	 (enters) Hi, honey.'
Chandler	 Hey, sweetums.'
Ross	 Hello to the rest.'
All	\xc2\xa0 Hi!'
Joey	 Monica what're you doin'? You can't go shopping with her? What about\nRachel?"
Monica	 It's gonna be a problem, isn't it?"
Chandler	 Come on, you're going to Bloomingdale's with Julie? That's\nlike cheating on Rachel in her house of worship."
Monica	 But I'm..."
Phoebe	 Monica, she will kill you. She will kill you like a dog in the street.'
Ross	 (to Monica) So, uh, Jules tells me you guys are going shopping tomorrow?'
Monica	 Yeah, uh, it's actually not that big a deal."
Ross	 It's a big deal to me. This is great, Monica. I really appreciate this."
Monica	 You're welcome."
Phoebe	 Woof, woof. '
Joey	 (A guy walks by) Bijan for men? (Another guy walks by) Bijan for men?\n(Another guy walks by) Bijan for men? (An attractive woman walks by.) Hey\nAnnabelle.'
Annabelle	 Hey, Joey. So did you hear about the new guy?'
Joey	 Who?'
Annabelle	 Nobody knows his name. Me and the girls just call him the Hombre man.'
Hombre Man	 (to a customer) Hombre? (The guy says yes, and gets his\nsample.)'
Joey	 What's he doin' in my section?"
Annabelle	 I guess he doesn't know."
Joey	 Well, he's gonna. I'll see you a little later, ok? (To the Hombre Man)\nHey, how ya doin'?"
Hombre Man	 Mornin'. "
Joey	 Listen, I know you're new, but it's kinda understood that everything from\nYoung Men's to the escalator is my territory."
Hombre Man	 Your territory, huh?'
Joey	 Yeah. Bijan for men?'
Guy	 No thanks.'
Hombre Man	 Hombre?'
Guy	 Yeah. All right. (They guy gets his sample and leaves.)'
Hombre Man	 (To Joey) You were saying?'
Monica	 Phoebe, listen. You were with me, and we were shopping all day.'
Phoebe	 What?'
Monica	 We were shopping, and we had lunch.'
Phoebe	 Oh, all right. What did I have?'
Monica	 You had a salad.'
Phoebe	 Oh, no wonder I don't feel full."
Rachel	 (entering) Hey, guys, what's up."
Phoebe	 I went shopping with Monica all day, and I had a salad.'
Rachel	 Good, Pheebs. What'd you buy?"
Phoebe	 Um, we went shopping for um, for, fur.'
Rachel	 You went shopping for fur?'
Phoebe	 Yes, and then I realized I'm against that, and uh, so then we bought\nsome, (sees Monica pointing at her chest) uh, boobs."
Rachel	 You bought boobs?'
Phoebe	 (Monica is yanking on her bra strap) Bras! We bought bras! We bought\nbras. '
Joey	 (to a guy) Bijan for men? (to a guy) Bijan for men? (To a woman) Bijan\nfor... (Sees it's a woman and stops.) (To Annabelle who walks up.) Hey, Annabelle, Uh,\nlisten, I was wondering if maybe after work you and I could go maybe grab a cup of coffee."
Annabelle	 Oh, actually I sorta have plans.'
Hombre Man	 (entering) Ready, Annabelle?'
Annabelle	 You bet. (to Joey) Maybe some other time?'
Joey	 (To a co-worker) Hey, it's not the first time I lost a girl to a cowboy\nspraying cologne. (A customer walks by.) Bijan for men? (The customer ignores him, and\nJoey starts to chase him) Bijan for men?! "
Carol	 Ok, and this is Funny Clown. Funny Clown is only for after his naps, not\nbefore his naps or he won't sleep."
Ross	 Carol, we've been through this before, ok? We have a good time. We laugh,\nwe play. It's like we're father and son."
Susan	 Honey, relax. Ross is great with him. (Ross looks at her.) Don't look so\nsurprised. I'm a lovely person."
Rachel	 Oh, this is so cute.'
Susan	 Oh, I got that for him.'
Ross	 My mommies love me. That's clever."
Monica	 Hello? Oh, Hi, Ju\xc2\x97(Sees Rachel is watching)\xc2\x97Hi, Jew! (Walks\ninto the kitchen.) (Listens.) Uh huh? (Listens.) Uh huh? (Listens) Ok. (Listens) Um, sure,\nthat'd be great. See ya then. Bye. (Hangs up.)"
Rachel	 Did you just say Hi, Jew?'
Monica	 Yes. Uh, yes, I did. That was my friend, Eddie Moskowitz. Yeah, he likes\nit. Reaffirms his faith.'
Phoebe	 Ben, dinner!'
Ross	 Thanks Aunt Pheebs. Hey, you didn't microwave that, did you, because it's\nbreast milk, and you're not supposed to do that."
Phoebe	 Duh, I think I know how to heat breast milk. Ok. (Squirts some on her\nwrist and tastes it.)'
Chandler	 What did you just do?'
Phoebe	 I licked my arm, what?'
Ross	 It's breast milk."
Phoebe	 So?'
Rachel	 Phoebe, that is juice, squeezed from a person.'
Joey	 What is the big deal? (Tastes the breast milk.)'
Chandler	 What did you just do?'
Ross	 Ok, would people stop drinking the breast milk?'
Phoebe	 You won't even taste it?"
Ross	 No!'
Phoebe	 Not even if you just pretend that it's milk?"
Ross	 Not even if Carol's breast had a picture of a missing child on it."
Monica	 Hey, where is everybody?'
Rachel	 They took Ben to the park. Where've you been?"
Monica	 Just out. Had some lunch, just me, little quality time with me. Thanks\nfor your jacket.'
Rachel	 Oh, no problem. You can borrow it, by the way. (Puts her hand in the\npocket) Here are your keys, hon. (She takes the keys out, sets them on the counter, and\nnotices she also grabbed a receipt.)'
Monica	 Okay.'
Rachel	 Mon, if uh you were at lunch alone, how come it cost you uh 53\ndollars?'
Monica	 You know what probably happened? Someone musta stolen my credit card.'
Rachel	 And sorta just put the receipt back in your pocket?'
Monica	 That is an excellent excellent question. That is excellent.'
Rachel	 Monica, what is with you? Who'd you have lunch with?"
Monica	 Judy.'
Rachel	 Who?'
Monica	 Julie.'
Rachel	 What?!'
Monica	 Jody!'
Rachel	 You were with Julie?'
Monica	 Look, when it started I was just trying to be nice to her because she\nwas my brother's girlfriend. And then, one thing led to another and, before I knew it, we\nwere...shopping."
Rachel	 Oh. Oh my God. '
Monica	 Honey, wait. We only did it once. It didn't mean anything to me."
Rachel	 Yeah, right.\xc2\xa0 Sure!'
Monica	 Really, Rachel, I was thinking of you the whole time. Look, I'm sorry,\nall right. I never meant for you to find out!"
Rachel	 Oh, please, you wanted to get caught. (Waves the receipt)'
Monica	 That is not true!'
Rachel	 Oh, so you just sort of happened to leave it in here?'
Monica	 Did it ever occur to you that I might just be that stupid?'
Rachel	 Ok, Monica. I just have to know one thing. Did you go with her to Bloomingdale's?\n(Monica looks away.) Oh! Ok, ok, ok, I just really, uh, I just really need to not be with\nyou right now. (Exits.)"

Monica	 (on the phone) Hi, who's this? (Listens) Hi, Joanne. Is Rachel working?\nIt's Monica. (Listens) Yes, I know I did a horrible thing. (Listens) Joanne, it's not as\nsimple as all that, ok? (Listens) No, I don't care what Steve thinks. (Listens) Hi, Steve."
Carol and Susan	 Hey! (This wakes Chandler and Ross up)'
Carol	 How did we do?'
Phoebe	 Oh, I tasted Ben's milk, and Ross freaked out."
Ross	 I did not freak out. '
Carol	 Why'd you freak out?"
Ross	 Because it's breast milk. It's gross."
Carol	 My breast milk is gross?'
Susan	 This should be fun.'
Ross	 No, no, Carol. There's nothing wrong with it. I just, I just don't think\nbreast milk is for adults."
Chandler	 Of course the packaging does appeal to grown-ups and kids alike.'
Carol	 Ross, you're being silly. I've tried it, it's no big deal. Just taste it.\n(Holding out a bottle.)"
Ross	 (jumping away) That would be no.'
Phoebe	 Come on. It doesn't taste bad."
Joey	 Yeah, it's kinda sweet, sorta like, uh..."
Susan	 Cantaloupe juice.'
Joey	 Exactly.'
Ross	 (staring at Susan) You've tasted it? You've tasted it."
Susan	 Uh huh.'
Ross	 Oh, you've tasted it."
Susan	 You can keep saying it, but it won't stop being true."
Ross	 (he rolls up his sleeve) Gimme the bottle. (Joey hands him the bottle and\nRoss squirts some on his arm.) Gimme the towel. (Joey gives him the towel and he wipes it\noff.) '
Chandler	 Howdy.'
Joey	 (sitting on the otherside of the counter from Chandler) Gimme a box a\njuice. Well, they switched me over to Hombre.'
Chandler	 Well, maybe it's because of the way you're dressed."
Joey	 Or maybe it's because this guy's doing so good they wanna put more people\non it. (Chandler pours some juice in a glass.) You should see this guy, Chandler, he goes\nthrough two bottles a day."
Chandler	 (slides the juice across the counter which Joey catches) What do you\ncare? You're an actor. This is your day job. This isn't supposed to mean anything to you."
Joey	 I know, but, I was the best, you know? I liked being the best. (He downs\nthe glass of juice in one swig.) I don't know. Maybe I should just get outta the game.\nThey need guys up in housewares to serve cheese."
Chandler	 (pours more and slides the refill to Joey) All right, say you do that.\nYou know sooner or later somebody's gonna come along that slices a better cheddar. And\nthen where're you gonna run?"
Joey	 Yeah I guess you're right."
Chandler	 You're damn right I'm right. I say you show this guy what you're made\nof. I say you stand your ground. I say you show him that you are the baddest hombre west\nof the lingerie."
Joey	 I'm gonna do it. (He downs the juice in one swig again.)"
Chandler	 All right. Now go see Miss Kitty and she'll fix you up with a nice\nhooker."
Monica	 I don't know what else to say."
Rachel	 Well that works out good, because I'm not listening."
Monica	 I feel terrible, I really do.'
Rachel	 Oh, I'm sorry, did my back hurt your knife?"
Monica	 Rachel, (they go back inside) say that I'm friends with her, we spend\nsome time together. Is that so terrible?"
Rachel	 Yes.'
Monica	 It's that terrible?"
Rachel	 Yes. Monica, you don't get it. It's bad enough that she's stolen the guy\nwho might actually be the person that I am supposed to be with, but now, she's actually\n(starting to cry), but now she's actually stealing you."
Monica	 Me? What are you talking about? Nobody could steal me from you. I mean,\njust because I'm friends with her doesn't make me any less friends with you. I mean,\n(starting to cry) you're my...We're, we're...Oh, I love you."
Rachel	 I love you too. (They hug.)'
Phoebe	 You guys, um I know that this really doesn't have anything to do with\nme, but um I love you guys too. (Joins in on the hug.) Oh, I really needed that. (Goes and\nsits down.)"
Monica	 Look, I know that you're in a place right now where you really need to\nhate Julie's guts, but she didn't do anything wrong. I mean, she was just a girl who met a\nguy, and now they go out. I really think that if you gave her a chance, you'd like her.\nWould you just give that a chance, for me?"
Rachel	 (crying) I'd do anything for you, you know that."
Monica	 (crying) I'd do anything for you. (They hug again.)"
Phoebe	 Wait, wait, wait, wait! (Runs over and joins in on the hug again.)'
Joey	 Mornin'. (The Hombre man ignores him) I said, mornin'."
Hombre Man	 I heard ya.'
Store Guy	 All right, everybody, I'm openin' the doors. You boys ready?"
Hombre Man	 Ready.'
Joey	 Yeah, I'm ready."
Customer	 You idiot, you stupid cowboy, you blinded me, I'm suing!"
Store Guy	 Oh my god, Todd! What the hell did you do?'
Hombre Man	 I'm sorry. I am such a doofus. I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry."
Annabelle	 (seeing the end result) My god, what happened?'
Joey	 These new kids, they never last. Sooner or later, they all...stop lastin'.\nListen, uh, what do you say I buy you that cup of coffee now?"
Annabelle	 Sure.'
Julie	 So.'
Rachel	 So. I just thought the two of us should hang out for a bit. I mean, you\nknow, we've never really talked. I guess you'd know that, being one of the two of us,\nthough, right?"
Julie	 I know, I probably shouldn't even tell you this, but I'm pretty much\ntotally intimidated by you."
Rachel	 Really? Me?'
Julie	 Yes. Oh my god, are you kidding? Ross is so crazy about you, and I really\nwanted you to like me, and, it's probably me being totally paranoid, but I kinda got the\nfeeling that maybe you don't."
Rachel	 Well, you're not totally paranoid."
Julie	 Oy.'
Rachel	 Um, ok, uh, oh god, um, when you and uh Ross first started going out, it\nwas really hard for me, um, for many reasons, which I'm not gonna bore you with now, but\num, I just, I see how happy he is, you know, and how good you guys are together, and um,\nMonica's always saying how nice you are, and god I hate it when she's right."
Julie	 Thanks. Hey, listen, would you like to go to a movie sometime or\nsomething?'
Rachel	 Yeah, that'd be great. I'd love it."
Julie	 I'd love it too. Shoot, I gotta go. So, I'll talk to you later."
Rachel	 All right, Julie.'
Julie	 Bye. (Gets up.)'
Rachel	 Bye. (After Julie exits.) What a manipulative bitch.'

Ross	 (with a mouthful) That's not bad. "
