Monica	 Hey! So what do you think?'
Chandler	 New haircut? (Monica nods \xc2\x91No.\xc2\x92) Necklace? (No) Dress? (No)\nBoots? (Monica nods \xc2\x91Yes.\xc2\x92) Boots!'
Monica	 Yes! Now, they\xc2\x92re a little more than I normally spend on\nboots\xc2\x85or rent (Shows him the receipt.)'
Chandler	 Oh my God!'
Monica	 I know.'
Chandler	 I\xc2\x92m gonna miss being able to afford food.'
Monica	 I\xc2\x92m sorry, they just, they just look so good! And the saleswoman\nwas looking at me like, "Oh, these are way too expensive for you."'
Chandler	 She had a point. (Shows her the receipt.) '
Rachel	 (entering) Hi!'
Monica	 Hey.'
Rachel	 Oh my God! (Notices the boots) Oh Monica! Those boots are amazing!'
Monica	 They\xc2\x92re mine!'
Chandler	 Yeah well, too bad we\xc2\x92re gonna have to return them.'
Rachel	 Return them?! Shh! They\xc2\x92re gonna hear you!'
Monica	 Honey, I\xc2\x92m not returning them. Okay? I mean I-I know they cost a\nlot, but I\xc2\x92m going to wear them all the time. You\xc2\x92ll see. Besides, I love the\ncompliments. I mean, have you ever had something so beautiful everyone wanted it?'
Chandler	 I have you.'
Monica	 Nice try; I\xc2\x92m keeping the boots.'

Ross	 That\xc2\x92s right, I love you! And-and I\xc2\x92m gonna play with you all\nthe time.'
Phoebe	 How can you let him talk to your crotch like that?'
Rachel	 (pause) He\xc2\x92s talking to the baby.'
Phoebe	 Ohh! Okay! Okay, cause when-when he said, "I can\xc2\x92t wait to\nhear your first words," I thought, "There\xc2\x92s a trick."'
Rachel	 Okay. Well, I gotta go you guys. I\xc2\x92ll see you later.'
Phoebe	 Okay.'
Ross	 Bye.'
Rachel	 Bye. (She gets up to leave but is stopped by Joey)'
Joey	 Oh hey Rach, listen\xc2\x97Hi!'
Rachel	 Hi.'
Joey	 Umm, can you do me a favor? I was talkin\xc2\x92 to my sister and she knows\nyou work at Ralph Lauren\xc2\x85'
Rachel	 No, forget it! No way! I am not sending anymore Ralph Lauren\nclothes to prison. It is a waste.'
Joey	 No-no-no-no-no-no, not her, not her. My youngest sister, Dina, she\xc2\x92s\nreally interested in fashion, and she wants to talk to someone successful, y\xc2\x92know, to\ngive her some advice.'
Rachel	 I guess I can talk to one of my supervisors\xc2\x85'
Joey	 Oh no-no-no-no, she wants to talk to you!'
Rachel	 Really?! Oh my God! I\xc2\x92m successful!'
Joey	 Okay, so will you meet with her?'
Rachel	 Yes! I\xc2\x92d love to! Have her come by the office.'
Joey	 Great! Thanks! You\xc2\x92re gonna love her so much. And\xc2\x97Oh, she\xc2\x92s\nthe smartest of all the Tribbiani children. Hey, y\xc2\x92know the S.A.T\xc2\x92s?'
Rachel	 Yeah.'
Joey	 She took \xc2\x91em!'
Phoebe	 Hey Ross! Doesn\xc2\x92t Ben go to the Smithfield Day School?'
Ross	 Yeah. Why?'
Phoebe	 Sting has a son that goes there too!'
Ross	 Yeah I know; he\xc2\x92s in Ben\xc2\x92s class.'
Phoebe	 You knew this and you never said anything?! With all the stupid dinosaur\nstuff you tell us?!'
Ross	 Fine! No more dinosaur stuff! Can I talk about fossils? (Joey is about to\nsit down and hears this so instead he groans and exits.)'
Phoebe	 Sting\xc2\x92s son, seven years old and there\xc2\x92s a picture.'
Ross	 What are you reading? The Kidnappers Guide to Manhattan Private Schools?'
Phoebe	 No, it\xc2\x92s New York magazine. It\xc2\x92s an article about the\nbest schools in the city. So how well do you know Sting?'
Ross	 Uh, I actually haven\xc2\x92t even met him.'
Phoebe	 Uh-huh, yeah that\xc2\x92s too bad. I really want to go to his concert\nFriday night, but it\xc2\x92s totally sold out. I know! Why don\xc2\x92t you meet him and get\ntickets?! If you get two I\xc2\x92ll take you.'
Ross	 Well actually, I\xc2\x92m picking Ben up tomorrow, maybe he\xc2\x92ll be\nthere.'
Phoebe	 There you go! Oh, you are so lucky! You might actually get to meet Sting\ntomorrow! That\xc2\x92s why you have kids!'
Monica	 Hey guys!'
Chandler	 Hey-hey.'
Rachel	 Hi Monica!'
Monica	 Hey. (Sits down on the arm of the couch.)'
Rachel	 Hi boots.'
Monica	 See Chandler? I\xc2\x92m getting a lot of use out of them already!\nThey\xc2\x92re very practical. See, you can wear them with dresses, with skirts, with\npants\xc2\x85'
Chandler	 You can wear them with shorts on a street corner and earn the money to\npay for them. (Goes and gets some coffee at the counter.)'
Phoebe	 Wow! They\xc2\x92re beautiful!'
Rachel	 Ahh\xc2\x85'
Monica	 (almost crying) They hurt so much!'
Phoebe	 What?!'
Monica	 The guy who made these hates feet and wants to see them die!'
Rachel	 Well-well you can give them to me! I haven\xc2\x92t felt my feet in years!'
Monica	 I can\xc2\x92t! I spent so much money on them and I told Chandler that\nI\xc2\x92d wear them all the time, I just can\xc2\x92t give them away!'
Phoebe	 Well then get your money back and return them!'
Monica	 I can\xc2\x92t do that either! The soles\xc2\x92 are already a little\nscuffed up and the insides are filled with my blood.'
Ross	 (entering) Hey!'
Chandler	 (returning to his seat) Hey!'
Ross	 Hey I uh just picked up Ben from school\xc2\x85'
Chandler	 (spinning around looking for him) I don\xc2\x92t think you did a very\nthorough job!'
Ross	 I dropped him off at Carol\xc2\x92s. (To Phoebe) Anyway, it turns out that\nI\xc2\x92m not going to be able to get those tickets though.'
Phoebe	 Oh no! Why not?'
Ross	 Well it turns out that Ben and Sting\xc2\x92s son do not get along.'
Phoebe	 How come?!'
Ross	 Apparently, Sting\xc2\x92s son made fun of the fact that Ben\xc2\x92s moms are\nlesbinims.'
Phoebe	 Wait! But Ross if they don\xc2\x92t get along then you should\nsmooth things over. Make them be friends.'
Ross	 Phoebe, you can\xc2\x92t force kids to be friends.'
Phoebe	 Sure you can! Give them some blocks, put them in a playpen!'
Ross	 Playpen?! Ben\xc2\x92s seven!'
Phoebe	 Your kid is seven?! (Ross nods, "Yes.") (To the rest)\nHe\xc2\x92s really small. (To Ross) Please! Please get the tickets!'
Ross	 Look I\xc2\x92m sorry Pheebs, I can\xc2\x92t do it.'
Phoebe	 Yes you can! Sting says so himself!'
Ross	 What?'
Phoebe	 (singing) Rosssss can!'
Ross	 Look Phoebe, I\xc2\x92m sorry it\xc2\x92s just\xc2\x85'
Phoebe	 (singing) Rossss can!'
Ross	 Phoebe, I\xc2\x85'
Phoebe	 (singing) Rosss can! Give me the tickets! Ross can give me the\ntickets!!'
Joey	 (entering, with Dina) Here she is! Future fashion superstar!'
Rachel	 Oh Joey, I\xc2\x92m hardly a\xc2\x85'
Joey	 My little sister Dina!'
Rachel	 Right! Hi Dina! '
Dina	 Hi.'
Rachel	 Nice to meet you. (They shake hands.)'
Dina	 Thanks so much for meetin\xc2\x92 with me. Joey\xc2\x92s told me so much about\nyou!'
Joey	 This is so exciting for her. Well, I\xc2\x92ll let you two fash\xc2\x85ists\nget down to business. (Exits.)'
Rachel	 Okay. All right Dina, well let\xc2\x92s talk about the different areas of\nfashion that you could get involved in. Let\xc2\x92s see, there\xc2\x92s design, but you may\nneed a whole other degree for that. Uh, there\xc2\x92s-there\xc2\x92s sales, which is great\nbecause you get to travel\xc2\x85'
Dina	 I\xc2\x85I don\xc2\x92t care about fashion! I\xc2\x92m pregnant! And I know you\nare too, so you gotta help me!'
Rachel	 (stunned) And there\xc2\x92s marketing\xc2\x85'
Monica	 (standing up) Ahhhhhhhh!'
Chandler	 (opening the door) What\xc2\x92s wrong?'
Monica	 Oh nothing I\xc2\x92m just\xc2\x97just was yawning. (Mimics the groan from\nbefore and stretches.)'
Chandler	 Oh don\xc2\x92t forget, my office holiday party is tonight. (They go\ninto the apartment.)'
Monica	 Honey, we don\xc2\x92t really have to go to this thing tonight do we?'
Chandler	 Now sweetie, I know you don\xc2\x92t like my office parties, but you can\nwear your new boots. See? Every cloud has a\xc2\x85supple leather lining.'
Monica	 I-I don\xc2\x92t-I don\xc2\x92t think that I\xc2\x92m gonna wear the boots\ntonight.'
Chandler	 Why not?'
Monica	 Well y\xc2\x92know, I\xc2\x92m just-I\xc2\x92m just worried that bosses will\nsee them and think they pay you too much money. Or! Or your assistant will see them\nand-and want a raise!'
Chandler	 Do you think I work at some kind of boot pricing company?'
Monica	 Anyway, I picked up this outfit that I want to wear and the, and the\nboots don\xc2\x92t really go with it.'
Chandler	 You said that you paid all that money because those boots go with\nskirts, dresses, and pants!'
Monica	 Fine! If you want me to wear the boots, I\xc2\x92ll wear the boots. In\nfact, I\xc2\x92ll go into my room right now and y\xc2\x92know try the outfit on.'
Chandler	 Okay.'
Monica	 Okay? (She starts to walk which causes her to start crying) Ooo wee!\nChristmas party in my boots! (Runs into the bedroom and mixes saying \xc2\x91ow\xc2\x92 with\nlaughing.)'
Dina	 I-I can\xc2\x92t go in there. I can\xc2\x92t tell him!'
Rachel	 Honey, it\xc2\x92s going to be okay. He\xc2\x92s been incredibly supportive\nof me, and if he gets a little upset; that\xc2\x92s what the meatball sub is for. (She gives\nDina a sandwich wrapped in aluminum foil.)'
Dina	 Thank you.'
Rachel	 Okay.'
Joey	 Hey! It\xc2\x92s my fashion girls! (They don\xc2\x92t react.) What\xc2\x92s\nwrong?'
Rachel	 Honey, why don\xc2\x92t you sit down? Dina has something that she wants to\ntell you.'
Joey	 (concerned) Oh. What\xc2\x92s, what\xc2\x92s going on? Is it mom? Is she sick?\nIs it dad\xc2\x92s heart? Is that a sandwich?'
Dina	 Joe, mom and dad are fine\xc2\x85'
Joey	 Is that a sandwich?!'
Rachel	 Joey\xc2\x85there\xc2\x92s something that you\xc2\x85should know. Dina?'
Dina	 I\xc2\x92m pregnant.'
Joey	 (angrily) What?!'
Rachel	 (To Dina) Now! Give him the sandwich! Give him the sandwich! (She\nquickly sets the sandwich in front of him.)'
Joey	 Well obviously this is a mistake! You can\xc2\x92t be pregnant! Because you\nhave to have sex to get pregnant!'
Dina	 Joe, I tried to wait until I was 25 like you did!'
Rachel	 What?! Dina\xc2\x85'
Joey	 (to Rachel) Bub!!! (Points at her and quiets Rachel.) (To Dina) I\ncan\xc2\x92t believe this! You\xc2\x92re the good one! You went to college! Both years! Who\ndid this to you?!'
Dina	 Bobby Corso, but he\xc2\x92s a real nice guy. I like him a lot. He\xc2\x92s\nreal funny.'
Joey	 You got pregnant for funny?! Dina\xc2\x85if he\xc2\x92s funny\xc2\x85laugh!\nAll right, I\xc2\x92ll be back in a little while! You stay here!'
Dina	 Why? Where are you going?'
Joey	 I can\xc2\x92t look at you right now! (Exits and slams the door behind him.)'
Dina	 Wow.'
Rachel	 I know.'

Phoebe	 Oh, there you are Ben!'
Ben	 Aunt Phoebe, what are you doing here?'
Phoebe	 Well, I heard you\xc2\x92re having a problem with one of the boys in your\nclass. And so I thought I would just come down here and sit you both down, have a little\ntalk and make it all okay. Now umm, the boy\xc2\x92s name is Sting\xc2\x92s son.'
Ben	 Jack? I hate him! He\xc2\x92s a jerk.'
Phoebe	 Now Ben, sometimes people may seem like jerks on the outside, but they\nhave famous fathers.'
Ben	 I have to go. My friend Doug is waiting for me over there. (Goes over to\nDoug.)'
Phoebe	 Him you\xc2\x92re friends with. (Starts looking at the children trying to\nfind Jack and a teacher notices her.)'
The Teacher	 Excuse me. Can, can I help you with something?'
Phoebe	 Yes! Yes you can, I\xc2\x92m looking for Jack\xc2\x92s parents.'
The Teacher	 Are you with one of the students?'
Phoebe	 Uh-huh, I\xc2\x92m with Ben.'
The Teacher	 Are you one of Ben\xc2\x92s mothers?'
Phoebe	 I am one of Ben\xc2\x92s mothers. I\xc2\x92m a lesbian. It was, it was\ndifficult coming out to my parents.'
The Teacher	 Well hi, I\xc2\x92m Jenny Boone. I\xc2\x92m the new teacher here.'
Phoebe	 Oh.'
The Teacher	 I\xc2\x92ve only met your partner Carol.'
Phoebe	 Ah! Okay so that would make me Susan.'
The Teacher	 Right. Are you looking for Jack\xc2\x92s parents to discuss the\nproblems he\xc2\x92s having with Ben? (Phoebe nods \xc2\x91Yes.\xc2\x92) Yeah. Because I really\ndo think the parents should sit down and have a conversation.'
Phoebe	 Yeah! Let\xc2\x92s do that!! That-that sounds good. We should sit down and\ntalk, just me, my lover Carol, and the Stings. Umm, how-how will I get in touch with them?'
The Teacher	 Oh, their number is on the contact sheet.'
Phoebe	 Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Umm, could-could I get a copy of that? \xc2\x91Cause Carol\nthrew it out, she lost ours. She\xc2\x92s such a scatterbrain, but man what a hot piece of\nass.'
Chandler	 Y\xc2\x92know, that party wasn\xc2\x92t bad.'
Monica	 Yeah! I didn\xc2\x92t know there would be dancing. That was a fun\nsurprise!'
Chandler	 I don\xc2\x92t see any uh, cabs. Maybe we should just walk?'
Monica	 Oh no, we can\xc2\x92t walk!'
Chandler	 What honey, it\xc2\x92s like fifteen blocks to the subway. Let\xc2\x92s\ngo.'
Monica	 Hey! Do you think that we can get to the subway right there if we climb\ndown through the manhole cover?'
Chandler	 What\xc2\x92s going on?'
Monica	 I can\xc2\x92t walk. Okay? Okay? These boots were a huge mistake!'
Chandler	 What?'
Monica	 Okay you were right! All right, I never should have bought them!\nThey\xc2\x92re killing me! One toe at a time!'
Chandler	 So I was right. This is what it feels like to be right. (Pause)\nIt\xc2\x92s oddly unsettling.'
Monica	 How are we gonna get home? Maybe a piggy-back ride?'
Chandler	 Hop on.'
Monica	 Okay. Wait, just give me a second, I need to just get my boots off\nfirst. (She starts taking them off.) Ah\xc2\x85Ooh\xc2\x85Oohh\xc2\x85Ohh\xc2\x85Oh\nGod\xc2\x85Ohh\xc2\x85Oh\xc2\x85Ohh\xc2\x85Ohhhh\xc2\x85'
Chandler	 Honey, I know you\xc2\x92re in pain right now, but I\xc2\x92m a little\nturned on.'
Dina	 Do you ever worry that you\xc2\x92ll be walking and your baby will just like\nslip out?'
Rachel	 What college was that Dina?'
Dina	 Oh my God! Bobby!'
Bobby	 Hi Dina. Good to see you.'
Rachel	 Joey, what are you doing?'
Joey	 Just what needs to be done! Dearly beloved, we are gathered here to join\nthis man and this woman\xc2\x85'
Rachel	 Oh Joey this is crazy!'
Joey	 Don\xc2\x92t interrupt me when I\xc2\x92m talkin\xc2\x92 to God! Now where were\nwe? Oh right, okay. Do you Dina, take this man\xc2\x85'
Dina	 No!'
Joey	 Oh you\xc2\x92ll take \xc2\x91em!'
Dina	 No I won\xc2\x92t!'
Joey	 Hey! You don\xc2\x92t get a say in this!'
Dina	 Yes I do!'
Joey	 Ahhh! I heard "I do", we\xc2\x92re halfway there! Okay! (To Bobby)\nYou!'
Rachel	 All right Joey! That is enough! (Grabs him and pulls him away from Bobby\nand Dina) Listen, as beautiful and moving as this ceremony is, it\xc2\x92s not legal. Okay?\nThey-they don\xc2\x92t have a marriage license, they don\xc2\x92t have any witnesses, and the\ngroom only has on one shoe!'
Bobby	 Yeah, he took the other one off and hit me with it.'
Joey	 Well what am I supposed to do?'
Rachel	 You\xc2\x92re supposed to realize that they are adults! And that they can\nmake their own decisions.'
Joey	 No they can\xc2\x92t! They were stupid enough to get knocked up!'
Rachel	 Heyyyyy! Contraceptives are not always effective! (To Bobby and Dina)\nRight?'
Bobby	 Yeah\xc2\x85we kinda didn\xc2\x92t use any\xc2\x85'
Rachel	 Oh, come on kids! A little help here!'
Phoebe	 Wow! This place is incredible! (Gasps) Sting\xc2\x92s pen\xc2\x85that he\ngave to Phoebe. (Puts the pen in her purse and goes over to a floor-to-ceiling bookcase)\nCome on! Secret passageway! (Starts pulling books at random as Trudie enters.)'
Trudie Styler	 Hi! (By the way, it\xc2\x92s actually her.)'
Phoebe	 Hi!'
Trudie Styler	 I\xc2\x92m Trudie.'
Phoebe	 Uh-huh.'
Trudie Styler	 You must be Ben\xc2\x92s mum.'
Phoebe	 Why else would I be here?'
Trudie Styler	 Do sit down.'
Phoebe	 Uh-huh. (They go and sit down.)'
Trudie Styler	 I gather Jack and Ben haven\xc2\x92t been getting along lately.'
Phoebe	 Yeah.'
Trudie Styler	 I\xc2\x92m told there are two sides to this story, but all\nI\xc2\x92ve heard is that Ben\xc2\x92s a bit of a poo-poo head.'
Phoebe	 Umm, I\xc2\x92m sorry. Won\xc2\x92t-won\xc2\x92t Jack\xc2\x92s father be joining\nus?'
Trudie Styler	 Oh I\xc2\x92m sorry, Jack\xc2\x92s father is not available.'
Phoebe	 Uh-hmm. Okay. Well then, could we reschedule? For say, Friday night\nperhaps at 8 o\xc2\x92clock?'
Trudie Styler	 Oh no, I know that wouldn\xc2\x92t work. My husband\xc2\x92s in\nconcert.'
Phoebe	 Concert. Yeah. That does put us in\xc2\x85quite a pickle. Because you see\nI\xc2\x92m very busy before and after the concert, and he\xc2\x92s obviously busy during.'
Trudie Styler	 So, I guess you and I should talk about Jack and Ben right now.'
Phoebe	 Unless! Unless umm, okay I-I would be willing to go to the concert, umm,\nall the while thinking about the children of course.'
Trudie Styler	 Are you here for tickets?'
Phoebe	 Oh, thank you. Four would be great.'
Trudie Styler	 I\xc2\x92m not giving concert tickets to someone who\xc2\x92d use\ntheir son like this!'
Phoebe	 Oh good! Then you\xc2\x92re in luck! Ben\xc2\x92s not my son!'
Trudie Styler	 (stands up) Look, I\xc2\x92ve just pressed a button, triggering a\nsilent alarm. Any minute now, the police will be here!'
Phoebe	 The Police? Here? A reunion?! (She gets out her camera.)'
Chandler	 Okay, ten blocks down. Five to go.'
Monica	 (notices something in the window) Oh wait! Stop! Stop! Stop!'
Chandler	 Oh I\xc2\x92m sorry! Do you need a break?'
Monica	 My boots in tan! Hey! Can you get a little closer so I can see the\nprice?'
Chandler	 I can see it from right here. It\xc2\x92ll cost you one husband.'
Monica	 Okay, I\xc2\x92m sorry. I think I can walk the rest of the way now.\nJust-just give me my boots.'
Chandler	 (pause) I don\xc2\x92t have your boots.'
Monica	 Well I don\xc2\x92t have them either. Where are they?'
Chandler	 Well, why don\xc2\x92t you check in one of my saddlebags while I chew on\na bale of hay!'
Monica	 Okay. (She gets off him.) God well, we gotta go back and get them!'
Chandler	 Honey, are you seriously ever gonna wear the boots again?'
Monica	 Okay, I\xc2\x92m never gonna wear them again. I just didn\xc2\x92t get a\nchance to say goodbye.'
Chandler	 Y\xc2\x92know what? You can say goodbye to the tan ones.'
Monica	 Okay. (Climbs back on his back.) All right.'
Chandler	 Okay. (Moves closer to the window.)'
Monica	 (to the boots) Bye boots\xc2\x97Wait! Half off?! (Chandler runs off.)'
Rachel	 Joey, just because they\xc2\x92re not getting married doesn\xc2\x92t mean\nthis is going to be a disaster. Maybe they have a plan!'
Joey	 Oh? Oh! Okay! Okay! Let\xc2\x92s hear their plan! Now, what\xc2\x92s the\nfuture look like for Dina and Bobby?'
Bobby	 Well\xc2\x85I really have high hopes for my band.'
Joey	 (to Dina) You were right. He is funny.'
Rachel	 Hey, now wait a minute! I get when you told people at first that you\nwanted to be an actor they laughed at you! Now come on Bobby, why don\xc2\x92t you tell us a\nlittle bit about your band?'
Bobby	 Well it\xc2\x92s just me and my pal Rooster, the band\xc2\x92s name is Numb\nNuts.'
Rachel	 (To Dina) Really? (Nods her head at Bobby.)'
Joey	 Dina, if you\xc2\x92re having a baby you should be married! Even if it is to\nBobby! (Bobby gets happy.) Dude, that\xc2\x92s not a compliment!'
Dina	 No Joey! I knew you wouldn\xc2\x92t be supportive!'
Joey	 So whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! What are you gonna do? You\xc2\x92re gonna have the\nbaby and-and raise it by yourself\xc2\x85without a husband?! You can\xc2\x92t be a single\nmother alone! You\xc2\x92re gonna ruin your life!'
Rachel	 Oh excuse me! Am I ruining my life?'
Joey	 No! No! No! It\xc2\x92s different for you. You\xc2\x92re so strong and\ntogether. You\xc2\x92re not some dumb kid who doesn\xc2\x92t know what she\xc2\x92s doing.'
Dina	 Excuse me?'
Joey	 One pregnant woman at a time, please! I just want you to be okay.'
Rachel	 So forcing her to marry Bobby is gonna make that happen?'
Joey	 Maybe! (To Bobby) Well! Well\xc2\x85so-so uh, what kind of music does Numb\nNuts\xc2\x97Oh forget it! I can\xc2\x92t!'
Dina	 Joey, I am scared to death about this. But I really think I can do it,\nI\xc2\x92m just gonna need some help. And Bobby\xc2\x92s gonna be here the whole time.'
Bobby	 You bet I am! (To Joey) And to answer your earlier question, we\xc2\x92re\nstraight-up gangster rap. (Joey shakes his head as if he\xc2\x92s about to lose it.)'
Dina	 Look, Rachel\xc2\x92s told me how much easier you\xc2\x92ve made all this on\nher. Why can\xc2\x92t you do that for me?'
Joey	 Because! \xc2\x91Cause\xc2\x85 \xc2\x91Cause you\xc2\x92re my baby sister!'
Dina	 And you\xc2\x92re my big brother! I mean, you\xc2\x92re my favorite guy in the\nwhole world. I\xc2\x92m not even scared to tell mom and dad. I was scared of telling you.'
Joey	 Well I\xc2\x92d be scared of them, but all right.'
Dina	 Joey, I can\xc2\x92t stand the thought of having this baby with you mad at\nme. I want him to have his uncle. Is my baby gonna have his Uncle Joey?'
Joey	 Of course he\xc2\x92s gonna have his Uncle Joey!'
Dina	 We\xc2\x92re gonna be all right. I mean, even if we\xc2\x92re not married this\nbaby is gonna be so loved. Not just by us.'
Joey	 That\xc2\x92s right! By his uncle too!'
Bobby	 And by you.'
Rachel	 Okay Bobby, why don\xc2\x92t we just come over here and let them have a\nlittle moment. (Drags Bobby away from Joey and Dina.)'
Joey	 Come here! (Hugs Dina and Bobby looks to hug Rachel.)'
Rachel	 No! Seriously! What\xc2\x92s wrong with you?!'

Ross	 You\xc2\x92re gonna love me so much. I got Sting tickets!! (Holds up two.)'
Phoebe	 Oh my God! I do love you! How did you do it?!'
Ross	 Well\xc2\x85let\xc2\x92s just say\xc2\x85 (singing) Rosss caaaaan!'
Phoebe	 Oo, where are the seats?'
Ross	 Uh, middle balcony.'
Phoebe	 Okay, now would you say that that\xc2\x92s more than 50 yards away from\nSting, his wife, or a member of his family?'
Ross	 Yeah.'
Phoebe	 Then that\xc2\x92s not breaking the law! I\xc2\x92m there!'
