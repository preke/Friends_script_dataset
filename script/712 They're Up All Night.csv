Monica	 (looking up) Ross, when\xc2\x92s this comet thing start?'
Ross	 Well, technically it seven billion years ago\xc2\x85 (Well,\ntechnically you\xc2\x92d be able to see it for days, well nights; that is if you could see\nit with all of the bright lights of New York.)'
All	 (groaning) Oh no! Oh no! (They all start to get up a leave.)'
Ross	 Okay! Okay! Fine, I\xc2\x92ll stop! No teaching, okay? We\xc2\x92ll just watch\nthe pretty light streaking across the sky. (Comets don\xc2\x92t streak across the sky,\nmeteors do.) Okay? Who\xc2\x92s official name is Bapstein-King.'
All	 Okay! Okay! (They start to leave again.)'
Phoebe	 (looking up) There it is! Oh, look at that! Isn\xc2\x92t Mother Nature\namazing?'
Chandler	 (looking up with her) That\xc2\x92s a plane!'
Phoebe	 Well, all right. 1700 bags of peanuts flying that high, that\xc2\x92s\npretty amazing too.'
Tag	 Hey, I wonder if you can see my apartment from up here.'
Rachel	 No. No, you can\xc2\x92t.'
Tag	 What?'
Rachel	 Oh I don\xc2\x92t-I don\xc2\x92t know.'
Ross	 Man, look at all those stars! (Yeah, you can see what? Five of them from\nthe city?) Infinite space. It really, really makes you wonder, doesn\xc2\x92t it?'
Joey	 (looking through his binoculars at a nearby building) Y\xc2\x92know what\nelse makes you wonder?'
Ross	 Huh?'
Joey	 Check out the rack on this chick! (Turns around to point it out to Ross\nand finds that Ross is glaring at him. So he quickly puts his binoculars to his eyes and\nstarts looking for the comet.)'

Monica	 Okay, we\xc2\x92ve been out here for two hours and we haven\xc2\x92t seen\nany stupid comets. Can we go now? I mean, Chandler\xc2\x92s getting chilly. (She walks over\nto where Chandler is bundled up in a big coat and shivering.)'
Chandler	 (with a quivering voice) No, I\xc2\x92m not!'
Joey	 Then why are you wearing Monica\xc2\x92s jacket?'
Chandler	 Because it\xc2\x92s flattering! (Shivers harder) Come on Monica! Come on\nMonica! (He goes inside.)'
Rachel	 Yeah actually, I think we\xc2\x92re gonna take off too. We rented a movie.'
Phoebe	 Oh! I won\xc2\x92t say, \xc2\x91no\xc2\x92 to a movie!'
Rachel	 Uh Pheebs, we just actually kinda wanted to be alone.'
Phoebe	 Shh! Get me out of here.'
Rachel	 Oh. (They leave, leaving just Joey and Ross.)'
Joey	 (whispering) Ross!'
Ross	 What?'
Joey	 Come here, check this out!'
Ross	 What? Is it the comet? (Runs over to where Joey\xc2\x92s standing.)'
Joey	 No! No-no. Look, there\xc2\x92s a bug stuck in tar right here. (Bends down\nto get a closer look.)'
Ross	 Joey come\xc2\x97I can\xc2\x92t believe\xc2\x97I bring you here to see the\nBapstein-King comet, one of nature\xc2\x92s most spectacular phenomenon, and all you care\nabout are bugs stuck in tar and-and some woman!'
Joey	 (standing up) Y\xc2\x92know, there\xc2\x92s two women dude.'
Ross	 Show me where?'
Joey	 Right-right up here. (Starts looking at them through a piece of pipe.)'
Ross	 (noticing the pipe and looking at the door) Joey where\xc2\x92s the pipe\nthat was holding the door open?'
Joey	 (annoyed) I don\xc2\x92t know! (Goes back to looking through the pipe.)\n(Pause) Yeah, I do.'
Ross	 Joey!'
Joey	 What?! All right\xc2\x97Hey! Don\xc2\x92t look at me! You\xc2\x92re the one who\nwanted to come up and look for some stupid Burger King comet!'
Ross	 It\xc2\x92s called the Bapstein-King comet, okay? (Joey starts to groan.)\nHey! Hey! Bapstein was a very well respected astronomer! '
Joey	 (covering his ears and yelling) Oh no! No! No! (He starts banging on the\ndoor.)'
Chandler	 (whispering) Monica!'
Monica	 She\xc2\x92s sleeping.'
Chandler	 I know, just quick-quick question, quick question. Which one was Deep\nImpact and which one was Armageddon?'
Monica	 Deep Impact was the one with Robert Duval, Armageddon is\nwhat\xc2\x92s going to happen to you if you wake me up.'
Chandler	 Sorry, I just\xc2\x85can\xc2\x92t sleep. Ooh! (Turns on the light and\nMonica groans.) Where is that book that you are reading with the two women who were\nice-skating and wearing, wearing those hats with the flowers on it? Because every time I\nlook at that cover I\xc2\x92m like\xc2\x85(Fake snores.)'
Monica	 It is in the living room where there is also a light! And no one will\nkick you in the shin.'
Chandler	 What?! (Monica kicks him in the shin.) Ow! (He gets out of bed and\nheads into the living room.)'
Phoebe	 (crossing her fingers and closing her eyes) Please don\xc2\x92t be a space\nship. Please don\xc2\x92t be a space ship. (She turns on the light and looks around and\nfinds that it\xc2\x92s the smoke detector that\xc2\x92s beeping.) Oh thank God! (She moves a\nchair over and starts to investigate how to make the beeping turn off, in frustration she\nyanks the thing off of the wall. She sets it down and heads for bed, just as she gets\nthere it beeps again. She opens the cover and removes the battery, but it still beeps.)\nHow could you be beeping?! I just disconnected you! I took out your battery! How can\xc2\x85'
Phoebe	 Don\xc2\x92t interrupt me!!'
Ross	 Rachel!! Monica!!'
Joey	 Come on!'
Ross	 I can\xc2\x92t believe this!!'
Joey	 All right well, y\xc2\x92know\xc2\x85I guess we know what we have to do to get\ndown.'
Ross	 (standing at the edge of the roof) Yeah, I guess we don\xc2\x92t have a\nchoice. (Screaming to the street) Help us! Please help us! We\xc2\x92re stuck up on the roof\nand we can\xc2\x92t get down!!!'
Joey	 Ross. I was thinking we could just go down the fire escape. (Points it\nout.)'
Ross	 (To Joey) I know, I wasn\xc2\x92t finished. (Joey motions him to finish.)\n(Yelling at the street) But don\xc2\x92t worry! We\xc2\x92re gonna go down the fire escape!!'
Chandler	 Shhhhhhhhh!!! (Monica enters) I\xc2\x92m sorry, I thought maybe I\xc2\x92d\nmake some warm milk and it would help me sleep.'
Monica	 With a wok? (Chandler\xc2\x92s holding a wok.) I thought you were going to\nread my boring book to put you asleep.'
Chandler	 It got interesting! Damn you Oprah!'
Monica	 Here, let me make the milk, I\xc2\x92m up anyway.'
Chandler	 Hey, y\xc2\x92know what we can do? Y\xc2\x92know, now that we are up? We\ncan just like talk to each other all night long, y\xc2\x92know like we did when we were\nfirst going out. It\xc2\x92d be fun!'
Monica	 Okay that does sound like fun. '
Chandler	 Okay, so how bummed were you when the second sister died huh?'
Monica	 The second sister dies?!'
Chandler	 (Pause) No. No, I-I was, I was talking about the book I was reading.'
Monica	 The second sister dies in Archie and Jughead Double Digest?'
Chandler	 That\xc2\x92s correct.'
Rachel	 You wanna go in the bedroom? It\xc2\x92s a little more comfortable.'
Tag	 Sure.'
Rachel	 Okay. (They start to head for the bedroom) Oh wait! Umm, did you send\nthose contracts to Milan?'
Tag	 If this is your idea of sexy talk? (Shakes his head that it\xc2\x92s not\nworking.)'
Rachel	 No seriously, y\xc2\x92know the contracts I gave you, did you overnight\nthem?'
Tag	 What contracts?'
Rachel	 Okay please tell me that this is just one of your jokes that you do that\nI don\xc2\x92t get.'
Tag	 Like what?'
Rachel	 Y\xc2\x92know, like the thing when you put the phone in your pants? (He\nstarts laughing.) Tag! I\xc2\x92m serious! This isn\xc2\x92t funny! Those contracts absolutely\nhad to go out today!'
Tag	 Rach, I\xc2\x92m sorry, but you didn\xc2\x92t give me any contracts!'
Rachel	 Yes I did! And I put a little Post-It on it that said, "Must\ngo out today," and underlined today three times and, and then I put a little heart in\nthe corner because I didn\xc2\x92t want to seem to bossy.'
Tag	 I\xc2\x92m telling you, you never gave them to me.'
Rachel	 Y\xc2\x92know what Tag, if we went down to the office you would see those\ncontracts sitting on your desk.'
Tag	 No, I would see you looking embarrassed because they are not on my\ndesk!'
Rachel	 Or maybe you would see me looking embarrassed because you are talking on\nthe phone with your crotch!'
Tag	 You wanna go down to the office right now?'
Rachel	 No! Come on its late, we\xc2\x92re not gonna go down to the office.'
Tag	 Okay I understand. (Sits down.) I wouldn\xc2\x92t want to be proved wrong\neither.'
Rachel	 Okay get your coat! (They get their coats and start to leave. Rachel\nsuddenly stops and sticks the hand up the back of her shirt.) Oh! When did you unhook\nthis? (Her bra.) Nice work!'
Joey	 All right, it won\xc2\x92t go down any further. It\xc2\x92s stuck.'
Ross	 Ugh. Well, we\xc2\x92re just gonna have to jump. (Joey looks at him.) Yeah.\nNow, we\xc2\x92re gonna have to make sure to land to the right of that patch of ice, okay?\nNot hit the dumpster on the other side and uh, and try to avoid that-that weird brownish\nred stuff in the middle. So, when you get down there\xc2\x85you go up to the\nroof and you let me in.'
Joey	 Oh whoa-whoa wait a minute! I have to do it?!'
Ross	 Yeah! Oh yeah, you\xc2\x92ll be fine! It-it\xc2\x92ll be uh, just like bungy\njumping. Y\xc2\x92know? But instead of bouncing back up you-you won\xc2\x92t.'
Joey	 What if I smack my head on the concrete?'
Ross	 Well, I\xc2\x92m gonna lie to you Joey, it\xc2\x92s a possibility.'
Joey	 (looks at the ground and at Ross) I don\xc2\x92t know Ross! I-I tell you\nwhat, let\xc2\x92s flip to see who does it, okay? You-you call it in the air, all right?'
Ross	 Oh, all right. (Joey flips the coin.) Tails! (The coin bounces off of the\nlanding above them and falls to the ground.) Can you-can you see what it is?'
Joey	 No.'
Ross	 Okay. Well, you be careful.'
Joey	 What? No! No Ross! No-no! Stop! I\xc2\x92m not jumping! Okay, look I have an\naudition tomorrow and I can\xc2\x92t go if I break my leg.'
Ross	 Well I\xc2\x92m jumping! I have a son! Okay? He won\xc2\x92t have a father\nif-if I die!'
Joey	 Well all right so, it looks like we\xc2\x92re even!'
Phoebe	 Okay. So, this wire is connected to this wire which plugs into here.\n(She points at each as she says it.) Okay so, to get the beeping to stop all I have to\ndo\xc2\x85 (She picks up a shoe and proceeds to pummel the smoke detector. She then gets up\nand heads to bed, stops, quickly turns around, and is satisfied that the beeping has\nstopped.) Well done, Pheebs. (She resumes her trek to bed, but is stopped at the entrance\nto the hallway by the now steady and extremely loud tone emanating from the smoke\ndetector.) (Yelling.) What do you want from me?!!!!!!!'
Monica	 Okay, here\xc2\x92s your milk. What do you want to talk about? (She sees\nthat Chandler has fallen asleep and slams the door loudly to wake him up.)'
Chandler	 (startled) What? What? What?'
Monica	 Ohh! Ohhhh! Were you sleeping sweetie? I\xc2\x92m sorry. Here. (Hands the\nmug of milk to him.)'
Tag	 Okay! Feel free to look, but I\xc2\x92m telling you those contracts are not\non this desk.'
Rachel	 Oh how can you possibly know? Look at this mess, Tag! I mean,\nthis is what I\xc2\x92m talking about! You have to be organized! You\xc2\x92ve got newspapers!\nYou\xc2\x92ve got magazines! You got\xc2\x97Ohh! (Finds a picture.) And who is this chippy? A\nlittle young for you Tag, but whatever.'
Tag	 It\xc2\x92s my sister.'
Rachel	 Okay, very cute braces. Anyway y\xc2\x92know what, the point is\nTag, start looking because you are going to find those contracts on your desk. (She goes\ninto her office.)'
Tag	 So when do you imagine you gave them to me? In the morning or in the\nafternoon?'
Rachel	 In the afternoon. Mr. Zelner came into my office after lunch. He put\nthem on my desk, and then I put a Post-It on it (Looks down onto her desk and finds\nthe folder with the Post-It on it that contains the contracts she imagined she gave\nTag) that said, "Must go out today." So you just keep looking in there! All\nright?'

Tag	 It\xc2\x92s not here.'
Rachel	 Puzzler. A bit of a puzzle. Why don\xc2\x92t you um, check the copy room,\nmaybe you left the contracts in there?'
Tag	 How could I have left them in the copy room?'
Rachel	 I don\xc2\x92t know Tag! How can your genitals make phone calls? Okay?\nIt\xc2\x92s not a perfect world! Just go please.'
Tag	 Fine.'
Rachel	 Thank you. (He leaves and she proceeds to plant the folder in his bottom\ndrawer. She then picks up the phone and holds it to her breasts.) Hello? (Hangs up the\nphone.) I still don\xc2\x92t get it.'
Monica	 Are you still awake?'
Chandler	 Yeah! You?'
Monica	 You do know that was me who just said that right? (He doesn\xc2\x92t\nrespond and she turns on the light, waking him.) Hey. As long as we\xc2\x92re both up\xc2\x85'
Chandler	 (intrigued) Yeah? (Monica nods yes.) I hope you\xc2\x92re not thinking\nabout cleaning the living room.'
Joey	 Man, I\xc2\x92m starving! What the hell was I thinking at dinner?! "Do\nyou want soup or salad?" Both! Always order both!'
Ross	 (looking in the window behind them) Y\xc2\x92know, y\xc2\x92know I\xc2\x92m\nlookin\xc2\x92 and I don\xc2\x92t think anyone\xc2\x92s home here. I say we just break the\nwindow, crawl through, and-and y\xc2\x92know explain later.'
Joey	 Yeah? Really? No one\xc2\x92s home?'
Ross	 I don\xc2\x92t think so. Hello? (Knocks on the glass, which angers the big,\nlarge, angry dog behind the glass and causes them to jump to the other side of the\nlanding.) When you get in there\xc2\x85 (Joey nods his disapproval.)'
Phoebe	 Okay, this is where you and I part ways. (She drops the blanket into the\nchute.) Noisy bitch!'
Monica	 What?! What are you doing?!'
Chandler	 Do you know what just happened?'
Monica	 Yeah. We-we had sex and then we fell asleep.'
Chandler	 No. We were in the middle of sex\xc2\x85and you fell asleep.'
Monica	 Nooo! No, that\xc2\x92s not true. No, best time ever! Yeah, you rocked me\nworld! (She turns out the light to go back to sleep.)'
Chandler	 (turning the light back on) Monica?'
Monica	 What?!'
Chandler	 I was giving you some of my best moves, and you missed it. So please\nwake up so we can do it right!'
Monica	 Okay. Okay, I\xc2\x92m ready. Come on big fella!'
Chandler	 Okay.'
Monica	 Give me the good stuff.'
Chandler	 Yeah! (Monica falls asleep) No! No! No! Don\xc2\x92t fall asleep! Okay,\nI am going to make you some coffee. (Monica doesn\xc2\x92t move as he gets out of bed and as\nhe\xc2\x92s heading for the door.) And I probably won\xc2\x92t spill coffee grounds all over\nthe kitchen floor.'
Monica	 Okay, I\xc2\x92m up! I\xc2\x92m up!'
Rachel	 Hi! I got you some coffee. To, uh\xc2\x85 (She looks for a place to set it\non his messy desk and he clears a spot for her to set it down.) \xc2\x85fair enough. So! Do\nyou got anything for me?'
Tag	 Still no luck.'
Rachel	 Oh my God! Did you check your entire desk! Did you check all the\ndrawers!'
Tag	 Do you want me to check again?'
Rachel	 Well yeah, I wish that you would. (He opens the top drawer.) Well, no\nit\xc2\x92s not in there! (Closes it.) How about that drawer? (She points to the bottom one\nand he opens it. She doesn\xc2\x92t see the folder she planted and bends over to check.)'
Tag	 Well, it\xc2\x92s not out here. Is there any chance it could be in your\noffice?'
Rachel	 (thinks) Y\xc2\x92know, I don\xc2\x92t-I don\xc2\x92t know. Let me, let me\ncheck. (As she heads for her office, she stops glances over her should at Tag, looks into\nher office, and finds the folder on her desk.)'
Tag	 (smirking) Any luck?'
Rachel	 Can I see you in my office for a minute?'
Tag	 (entering) Yeah? (She holds up the folder) You found them!! (Rachel is not\namused, because she\xc2\x92s still going to try to blame him for her mistake like every\n\xc2\x91good\xc2\x92 boss.) Y\xc2\x92know what? I\xc2\x92m not even going to gloat. I\xc2\x92m just\nreally relived this whole thing is over.'
Rachel	 You put these on my desk!'
Tag	 I did not!'
Rachel	 Oh really? So you\xc2\x92re saying they just slid out of your\nbottom drawer, crawled across the floor, then jumped on to my desk?! (I think Dogbert\nshould have a line here.)'
Tag	 How did you know they were in my bottom drawer?'
Rachel	 (pause as she realizes her lame attempt to shift the blame has failed) I\nam so hot for you right now.'
Phoebe	 Oh my God! How did you get back here?!'
Phoebe	 (scared) Fire alarm? (She opens the door to reveal a fireman holding the\nblanket with the smoke detector.) Oh! Hi, officer\xc2\x97fireman, can-can I help you?'
The Fireman	 We found your fire alarm in the trash chute.'
Phoebe	 That\xc2\x92s not mine.'
The Fireman	 Yes it is.'
Phoebe	 How do you know?'
The Fireman	 The next time you want to dump a fire alarm in a trash chute,\ndon\xc2\x92t wrap it in a blanket that says, "Property of Phoebe Buffay not\nMonica."'
Phoebe	 Okay do you\xc2\x97Okay, do you have a search warrant? Because the last\ntime I checked this was still America!'
The Fireman	 Please reattach this, it\xc2\x92s against the law to disconnect them.'
Phoebe	 Fine! (She takes the blanket.) But please God; tell me how to stop them\nfrom going off!'
The Fireman	 There\xc2\x92s a reset button under the plastic cover.'
Phoebe	 There\xc2\x92s a reset button?! Ugh, thank you! Thank you! (He exits and\nshe goes to shut it off.) There\xc2\x92s a reset button! My God! Why didn\xc2\x92t I see that!\n(She takes off the plastic cover and looks for the button.) Reset button, reset button,\nwhere is there a reset button? (Finds it.) Oh here it is! (Picks it up off of the floor.)\nOh! (She presses it hard, but of course it would help if the button was still attached to\nthe detector. In frustration she presses it so hard it causes pain in her thumb.) Ohh,\nGod!'
Ross	 Okay, do-do you have a good grip?'
Joey	 Yeah!'
Ross	 Okay, I\xc2\x92m going to start climb down you now.'
Joey	 All right! Just hurry up!'
Ross	 Okay. Now-now-now should I climb down your front so we\xc2\x92re face to\nface or-or should I climb down your back so we\xc2\x92re-we\xc2\x92re butt to face.'
Joey	 I think face to face.'
Ross	 I would say that.'
Joey	 Face to face, yeah!'
Ross	 Okay, here I go.'
Joey	 All right. '
Joey	 (grunting) Oh my\xc2\x85 How much do you weigh Ross?!'
Ross	 I prefer not to answer that right now, I\xc2\x92m still carrying a little\nholiday weight.'
Joey	 Y\xc2\x92know, when we talked about face to face, I don\xc2\x92t think we\nthought it all the way through.'
Ross	 So what do you want me to do?'
Joey	 Well, just shimmy down me and drop!'
Ross	 Hi.'
Joey	 Hi.'
Ross	 (looking down) M-maybe I should hang and you can climb down me.'
Joey	 (angrily) Yeah? Maybe we should talk about that for a little while!'
Ross	 It\xc2\x92s still looks pretty far!'
Joey	 It\xc2\x92s not that far! Just drop!'
Ross	 Do not rush me!!'
Joey	 Ross, you should know that my pants are startin\xc2\x92 to come down and\nI\xc2\x92m not wearing any underwear!'
Ross	 Oww!! My ankle! I really hurt my ankle! I think I twisted it when\nI\xc2\x97Ooh, a quarter!'

Monica	 That really was some of your best work.'
Chandler	 Hm-hmm, I told you! (Looks at the clock) I can\xc2\x92t believe that\nI\xc2\x92ve only got two hours before I call in sick for work.'
Monica	 I have to be up in seven minutes.'
Chandler	 Well, you\xc2\x92re not gonna believe this, but if you have seven\nminutes\xc2\x85'
Monica	 Really?!'
Chandler	 Do you wanna?'
Monica	 Okay! You get the vacuum cleaner and I\xc2\x92ll get the furniture polish!'
