Chandler	 (entering) Hey!'
Phoebe	 Hey! Check it out! This is unbelievable! Joey has been holding his\nbreath for almost four minutes! '
Joey	 (To Chandler) Dude! What are yo\xc2\x97you trying to kill me?!'
Rachel	 (entering from her room) Pheebs, I wanna ask you something.'
Phoebe	 Uh-huh, what?'
Rachel	 Well since I\xc2\x92m movin\xc2\x92 out and-and you\xc2\x92re so\nbeautiful\xc2\x85'
Phoebe	 Oh!'
Rachel	 \xc2\x85how about I move in with you?'
Phoebe	 Well, that would be great but then what do we do about Denise?'
Monica	 Who\xc2\x92s Denise?'
Phoebe	 My roommate.'
Rachel	 You have a roommate?!'
Phoebe	 Yes, Denise. Denise! '
Joey	 Hey, what is with the secrecy Phoebe? Huh? And what about this Denise, is\nshe cute?'
Chandler	 Pheebs, I don\xc2\x92t understand. How can you have a roommate that none\nof us know anything about?'
Phoebe	 Maybe because you never listen to anything that I say. I talk about her\nall the time! DENISE!!!!!'
Joey	 Hey Rach, listen I was thinkin\xc2\x92 uh, I\xc2\x92m gonna have an extra room\nover at my place\xc2\x85'
Rachel	 Oh, that\xc2\x92s true.'
Joey	 Yeah, why don\xc2\x92t you move in with me? It\xc2\x92ll be great! We could\nstay up late, watch movies, and you know about Naked Thursday\xc2\x92s right?'
Rachel	 Yeah, yeah I think I\xc2\x92m gonna find my own place.'
Chandler	 Hey-hey! I thought Naked Thursday\xc2\x92s was just our thing man!'

Phoebe	 Hey.'
Ross	 Hey!'
Phoebe	 So, what did Rachel say when you told her you were still married to her?'
Ross	 Oh, that. Umm, she took it really well.'
Phoebe	 You didn\xc2\x92t tell her did you?'
Ross	 No. '
Phoebe	 Of course not, because you\xc2\x92re in love with her.'
Ross	 I am not in love with her. She was very upset about having to move out so\nI eh, didn\xc2\x92t tell her we were still married because she would only get more upset.\nI-I just comforted her, as a friend.'
Phoebe	 What do you mean, comforted her?'
Ross	 It\xc2\x92s nothing, I just gave her a hug.'
Phoebe	 Ah-ha! A classic sign of love, the hug!'
Ross	 It\xc2\x92s also a sign of friendship.'
Phoebe	 Yeah, not in your case Lovey Loverson. (Tries to take a bite out of\nRoss\xc2\x92s cookie.)'
Ross	 (grabs back his cookie) It was a hug!'
Phoebe	 Okay, just tell me this, did you or did you not smell her hair?'
Ross	 S-s-smell her hair? What if I did?'
Phoebe	 Ninety percent of a women\xc2\x92s pheromones come out the top of her\nhead! That\xc2\x92s why, that\xc2\x92s why women are shorter. So that men will fall in love\nwhen they hug them! (Ross is staring at her dumbfounded.) Oh come on Ross, you\xc2\x92re a\nscientist. '
Ross	 I was hugging her as a friend. It\xc2\x92s not my fault her-her hair got in\nmy face, she\xc2\x92s got a lot of it and it smells all-all uh\xc2\x85coconutty. (Phoebe\nraises her eyebrows.) What?! Oh, that doesn\xc2\x92t mean I have feelings for Rachel! Maybe\nit means I have feelings for coconuts!'
Phoebe	 (taking his coffee) Okay, whatever you say. But just be careful, all\nright? Rachel\xc2\x92s not in the same place you are.'
Ross	 (grabbing back his coffee) If the place you are referring too is being in\nlove, then she is in the same place as me because I am not in that place!'
Phoebe	 Okay, I didn\xc2\x92t understand that, but y\xc2\x92know, maybe that\xc2\x92s\n\xc2\x91cause you were speaking the secret language of love! '
Joey	 Hey! (To Chandler) Dude, some guy just called for you.'
Chandler	 Who was it?'
Joey	 I don\xc2\x92t know! How about, "Thanks for taking the message."\nJeez! (Exits.)'
Monica	 Okay listen, y\xc2\x92know when you move in Rachel\xc2\x92s room is gonna be\nempty, you wanna talk about what we want to do with it?'
Chandler	 Sure!'
Monica	 Okay, I was thinking we should have a beautiful guest room, right? With\na mahogany sleigh bed and bedside tables with flowers on them all the time! And we could\nhave a roll top desk with comment cards on them so people could say how much they loved\nstaying here!! Okay, whatever, I really haven\xc2\x92t thought about it that much.'
Chandler	 Well, I like that idea. Obviously! I was thinking maybe-maybe-maybe it\ncould be a game room, y\xc2\x92know? I mean you can buy old arcade games like uh, like Space\nInvaders and Asteroids for $200, the real ones! The big-big ones!'
Monica	 No.'
Chandler	 Okay so you mean no as in, "Gee Chandler, what an interesting\nidea. Let\xc2\x92s discuss it before we reject it completely."'
Monica	 Oh, I\xc2\x92m sorry. Of course I mean that. Interesting idea, umm, talk\nabout it, but no.'
Chandler	 So, that\xc2\x92s it?'
Monica	 I just don\xc2\x92t think arcade games go in the beautiful guest room. The\nbeautiful guest room is gonna be filled with antiques.'
Chandler	 Which is why Asteroids is perfect! It\xc2\x92s the oldest game!'
Monica	 What do you have against the beautiful guest room?'
Chandler	 I don\xc2\x92t have anything against the beautiful guest room,\nespecially since everybody we know lives about 30 seconds away!'
Monica	 Are you mocking me?'
Chandler	 No, I\xc2\x92m not mocking you, (in a mocking voice) or you beautiful\nguest room. (Exits.)'
Joey	 Hey, what\xc2\x92s up?'
Chandler	 Nothing, Monica and I had a stupid fight.'
Joey	 But you\xc2\x92re still moving in together, right? Because my ad came out\ntoday. (Shows him the paper.)'
Chandler	 (reading the ad) "Wanted. Female roommate, non-smoker,\nnon-ugly." Nice!'
Joey	 Yeah? I just figured y\xc2\x92know, after living with you it\xc2\x92d be an\ninteresting change of pace to have a female roommate, y\xc2\x92know? Someone I can learn\nfrom, someone-someone who\xc2\x92s different than me. And what\xc2\x92s more different than\nme; a guy who\xc2\x92s not 19 than say a girl who is 19? Enh? (Points to his head.)\nNot just a hat rack my friend!'
Rachel	 Pheebs, I have to ask you\xc2\x85'
Phoebe	 Shhhhhh! I\xc2\x92m swamped right now.'
Rachel	 You\xc2\x92re just staring into space.'
Phoebe	 Umm, I\xc2\x92m trying to move that pencil. (There\xc2\x92s a pencil lying\non the table.)'
Rachel	 This one? (Picks it up.)'
Phoebe	 It worked!'
Rachel	 Pheebs, this whole apartment thing is just a nightmare! Every place I\ncan afford comes with a roommate who is a freak. I mean, look at this; (Points to one and\nstarts to read it.) "Wanted. Female roommate, non-smoker, non-ugly." It\xc2\x92s\njust, there is nothing! The city\xc2\x92s full!'
Phoebe	 Wait, no, look at this! (Points to one.) (Reading) "Two bedroom,\ntwo bath, must be non-smoker, Satan worshipers okay\xc2\x85" Oh, yeah, but it\xc2\x92s on\nthe ground floor.'
Ross	 (entering) Hey!'
Rachel	 Hey.'
Ross	 Rach, uh, you still looking for a place?'
Rachel	 Yeah! Why?'
Ross	 Okay, there\xc2\x92s this guy, Warren, from the museum and he\xc2\x92s going\non a dig for like two years and he\xc2\x92s got this great place he needs to sublet. So uh,\nyou interested?'
Rachel	 That sounds great! I\xc2\x92d love to live at Warren\xc2\x92s!! I love\nWarren! Thank you!'
Ross	 Don\xc2\x92t thank me! If you wanna thank something, thank the volcano that\nerupted thousands of years ago, killing but perfectly preserving an entire civilization.\n(Rachel just looks at him.) Here\xc2\x92s Warren\xc2\x92s number.'
Rachel	 Oh, this is great! I am gonna call him right now! (Jumps up.) Oh, thank\nyou! '
Ross	 Okay, you go grab it!'
Phoebe	 I saw it.'
Ross	 I don\xc2\x92t know what you\xc2\x92re talking about.'
Phoebe	 Umm, I\xc2\x92m talking about that which you already know but won\xc2\x92t\nadmit. You love her again; you re-love her!'
Ross	 Look, I do not re-love her.'
Phoebe	 I can\xc2\x92t believe you won\xc2\x92t just admit it! (Pause) Okay, just\npromise me that you won\xc2\x92t do anything stupid.'
Ross	 Look, we\xc2\x92re just friends now! Okay? Why would I do anything stupid?'
Rachel	 (returning from calling Warren) Ugh!!! Well, the apartment is already\nsubletted! I mean, this is just hopeless. I\xc2\x92m never gonna find anything.'
Ross	 You can live with me.'
Rachel	 What?!'
Phoebe	 What?!'
Ross	 What?'

Rachel	 Oh my God! Are you serious?!'
Ross	 Uh-huh. (Phoebe grunts.)'
Rachel	 I would love to live with you Ross; that\xc2\x92s-that\xc2\x92s great! Thank\nyou!'
Ross	 Well, I\xc2\x92m-I\xc2\x92m just glad I could, y\xc2\x92know, help you out.'
Phoebe	 Wow! I\xc2\x92m-I\xc2\x92m so happy for you guys. (To Ross) This is so-so,\nnot stupid.'
Rachel	 Ross-Ross, you have no idea what this means to me! I mean, I mean I was\ngonna be homeless. You just saved me! You\xc2\x92re my hero!'
Ross	 Hero, I uh, I don\xc2\x92t know\xc2\x97well, all right.'
Rachel	 Oh, I have to go tell Monica what a wonderful brother she has! (Kisses\nhim on the cheek and exits.) '
Ross	 Oh please! (He sits down.) (To Phoebe) You\xc2\x92re gonna say things now,\naren\xc2\x92t ya?'
Phoebe	 No. No, I won\xc2\x92t. But I should tell you this, this exact same thing\nhappened to my roommate Denise. She moved in with a guy who was secretly married to her\nand he said he didn\xc2\x92t love her, but he really did, and it just blew up! And\nthat\xc2\x92s how she ended up living with me! (Ross looks at her.) (Pause) Okay,\nthat\xc2\x92s a lie.'
Chandler	 Hi.'
Monica	 Hi.'
Chandler	 Hi, listen, I\xc2\x92m sorry about before. I don\xc2\x92t need to have a\ngame room. I mean when I was a kid I only played those games because I couldn\xc2\x92t get\ngirls, and now I can \xc2\x91em\xc2\x97Now, I have you. (Monica glares at him.) Not-not\nthat I think that I have you or think of you as property in any sort of way, I see\nwomen\xc2\x85'
Monica	 Stop it Chandler. (Chandler is relieved) I\xc2\x92m sorry too.'
Chandler	 Really?'
Monica	 Yeah! Oh yes!'
Chandler	 Ohh.'
Monica	 Listen, we don\xc2\x92t have to make that a guest room, we can think of\nsomething to do with the room together.'
Chandler	 That\xc2\x92s a great idea! We can easily think of a way for us\nboth to enjoy the room.'
Monica	 Totally!'
Chandler	 We don\xc2\x92t have to come up with this now.'
Monica	 Oh good.'
Chandler	 Hey, y\xc2\x92know what? Why don\xc2\x92t we think about changes we can\nmake in the living room?'
Monica	 Changes?'
Chandler	 Yeah, I mean we\xc2\x92re gonna have to move around some furniture to\nmake room for my chair. (Kisses her and heads into the living room.)'
Monica	 You\xc2\x92re-you\xc2\x92re-you\xc2\x92re gonna bring the Barca Lounger over\nhere?'
Chandler	 Is that a problem?'
Monica	 Well, it\xc2\x92s a set and they should probably stay together.'
Chandler	 Oh, that\xc2\x92s cool. Then I\xc2\x92ll just bring them both over.'
Monica	 See now-now you\xc2\x92re taking them away from their home.'
Chandler	 Okay, I get it. So, I get nothing! Nothing here is mine! Everything\nhere is yours! I\xc2\x92ll get up in the morning put on your clothes, and head off to work!'
Monica	 Yeah-yeah, y\xc2\x92know what? Yeah, that\xc2\x92s it-that\xc2\x92s it,\neverything will be mine! Nothing will be yours! That\xc2\x92s-that\xc2\x92s what I said! Oh\ncome on, Chandler! I\xc2\x92m talking about the barca lounger! It just, it doesn\xc2\x92t\nmatch! Where is it gonna go?!'
Chandler	 In the game room!'
Monica	 Look it is not my fault that your chairs are incredibly ugly!'
Chandler	 All right! That\xc2\x92s fine! That\xc2\x92s fine! I won\xc2\x92t bring over\nthe chairs! I won\xc2\x92t bring anything over! I wouldn\xc2\x92t want to ruin the ambiance\nover here at Grandma\xc2\x92s place!! (Storms out.)'
Joey	 (exiting from Chandler\xc2\x92s room with the new roommate) Everything on\nyour application looks really good\xc2\x97Ohh! Just one last question umm, are you and your\nfriends gonna be over here all the time like partying and hanging out?'
The Potential Roommate	 Oh don\xc2\x92t worry, I\xc2\x92m not really a party girl.'
Joey	 Whoa!! Now look, don\xc2\x92t be just blurtin\xc2\x92 stuff out. I want you to\nreally think about your answers. Okay?'
Chandler	 (entering) You can call off the roommate search! (To the potential\nroommate) Hi! I\xc2\x92ll be living here. (Heads for the bathroom.)'
Joey	 Oh don\xc2\x92t listen to him, he\xc2\x92s just some guy who really wants the\napartment, but I don\xc2\x92t think he\xc2\x92s gonna get it.'
Chandler	 Why did you take the shower curtain down?'
Joey	 That thing was a hazard! (To the potential roommate) I\xc2\x92m very safety\nconscious.'
Rachel	 Hey!'
Ross	 Hey! Oh listen, I was just clearing some space for your stuff.'
Rachel	 Oh thanks, but listen, I was just at Monica\xc2\x92s and she and Chandler\nhad a big fight and they\xc2\x92re not moving in.'
Ross	 What do you mean, they\xc2\x92re not moving in? They-they\xc2\x92re still\nmoving in right?'
Rachel	 No-no, they just had a big blowout over what to do with my room.'
Ross	 What?! Over a stupid room!'
Rachel	 Yeah, I feel kinda bad for them, but I\xc2\x92m also really psyched\n\xc2\x91cause I don\xc2\x92t have to move in here!'
Ross	 Oh no, yeah no, that part\xc2\x92s great!'
Ross	 What\xc2\x92s all this about you guys fighting?! Is this really over a\nroom?! I mean, that is so silly!'
Monica	 Ross, we can handle this.'
Ross	 Well, apparently not, and I can\xc2\x92t just stand by and watch two people\nI care about very much be hurt over something that is so silly. I mean, enough of the\nsilliness!'
Chandler	 Well, why don\xc2\x92t you tell her to stop being silly! (Monica mocks\nhim and he joins in.)'
Ross	 (stopping them) Okay-okay! Two very good points, look I\xc2\x92ve known you\nboth a long time, and I\xc2\x92ve never seen either of you one/millionth as happy as\nyou\xc2\x92ve been since you\xc2\x92ve got together. Do you really want to throw that all away\nover a room? That is so silly. Now wh-what is more important, love or silliness?'
Chandler	 Well, we are fond of the silliness, but we also have a soft spot for\nthe love.'
Monica	 Love is the best medicine.'
Chandler	 That\xc2\x92s laughter.'
Monica	 Why do you do it?'
Chandler	 I don\xc2\x92t know.'
Ross	 Okay! All right! Now, Chandler you-you wanna live with Monica, right?'
Chandler	 Yeah, I do.'
Ross	 And Mon, you wanna live with Chandler, don\xc2\x92t ya?'
Monica	 Yes.'
Ross	 (jumping up) Good! A verbal contract is binding in the state of New York!\n(Storms out.)'
Gunther	 So I understand you\xc2\x92re looking for a place.'
Rachel	 No-no, I\xc2\x92m staying put.'
Gunther	 Oh, I was going to offer you my apartment.'
Rachel	 Why, where are you going?'
Gunther	 I don\xc2\x92t know.'
Ross	 (entering) Hey Rach!'
Rachel	 Hi!'
Ross	 You\xc2\x92re never gonna believe it uh, Monica and Chandler are moving in\nagain. That\xc2\x92s great news right\xc2\x97I mean for them. Right?'
Rachel	 Oh wow.'
Ross	 Yeah but, on the bright side, we get to be roommates again.'
Rachel	 Yeah. Y\xc2\x92know umm, uh, umm, about that, umm, Ross I really\nappreciate your offer to let me move in and everything, but don\xc2\x92t you think it\xc2\x92s\ngonna be weird?'
Ross	 Wh-why?! Why-why-why would it, why would it be weird?'
Rachel	 Well, because of us! Because of our history.'
Ross	 No!'
Rachel	 No?'
Ross	 No! No! It would be weird if we were still in that place, I mean are you\nstill in that place?'
Rachel	 No! Not at all!'
Ross	 Good! Me neither! So it\xc2\x92s not a problem. We\xc2\x92re just two friends\nwho happen to be roommates.'
Rachel	 Okay, but Ross, eventually you and I are gonna be dating.'
Ross	 Really?! We are?'
Rachel	 Yeah! I\xc2\x92m gonna have a boyfriend, you\xc2\x92re gonna have a\ngirlfriend\xc2\x85'
Ross	 Ohh! That would be great.'
Rachel	 But y\xc2\x92know what, if you think it\xc2\x92s gonna be okay we\xc2\x92ll\njust work out a system. Y\xc2\x92know, it\xc2\x92ll be like college, I\xc2\x92ll hang a hanger\non the door and put a sign, "Come back later, I\xc2\x92m gettin\xc2\x92 lucky."\n(Laughs.)'
Ross	 (laughs as well, but for a different reason) Yeah, I didn\xc2\x92t think of\nthat.'
Ross	 So are you sure about this whole moving in thing?! I mean it\xc2\x92s a really\nbig step! And-and what\xc2\x92s the rush?!'
Monica	 That\xc2\x92s very funny!'
Chandler	 He\xc2\x92s being silly, because he knows that we enjoy the silliness!'
Ross	 No, I-I-I\xc2\x92m serious, okay? I mean, think about it. You move in, you\nstart fighting over stupid game rooms, next thing y\xc2\x92know you break up!'
Monica	 Ross, you were right before, it was just a stupid fight about a room.'
Ross	 Okay, there are no stupid fights!! This isn\xc2\x92t about the room, this is\nabout what the room\xc2\x85represents! And unfortunately, this room (Points to Rachel\xc2\x92s\nroom) could destroy you!!'
Chandler	 Yeah, I'm not so worried."
Monica	 Yeah, no, me neither.'
Ross	 Fine! It\xc2\x92s your life! (Starts to storm out mad about his failed\nattempt at the manipulation of his best friend and sister, but stops and tries one last\ntime.) I just don\xc2\x92t want to see you guys break up! Which you will do if you\nmove in together, (Monica and Chandler just stare at him.) but that\xc2\x92s what you want,\nthere\xc2\x92s nothing I can do. (Opens the door and tries one more time.) DON\xc2\x92T DO\nIT!!!!! (Finally leaves.)'
Monica	 You still want to move in together right?'
Chandler	 Of course!'
Monica	 Ross didn\xc2\x92t scare you?'
Chandler	 Scared me out of ever wanting to live with him.'
Monica	 Come here, I want to show you something!'
Chandler	 Okay!'
Chandler	 Oh my God! Someone\xc2\x92s killed Square Man!'
Monica	 This is where I thought the barca lounger could go! You see you could\nsee the TV and it\xc2\x92s still walking distance to the kitchen.'
Chandler	 Oh that\xc2\x92s so sweet! I want to show you something too!'
Monica	 Okay!'
Chandler	 Y\xc2\x92know those big-big uh, road signs that say "Merge?"'
Monica	 Uh-hmm.'
Chandler	 Y\xc2\x92know? So I was thinking that we could get one of those signs\nand hang it over our bed. Because, that\xc2\x92s you and I together! Merge!'
Monica	 Oh my God! I love that!'
Chandler	 Really?!'
Monica	 Uh, no!!'
Phoebe	 (singing) I found you in my bed! \n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nHow\xc2\x92d you whined up there? \n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nYou are a mystery!\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nLittle black curly hair!\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nLittle black curly hair!\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nLittle black, little black, little black, little black, little black curly\nhair\xc2\x85\xc2\x85\xc2\x85\xc2\x85'

Ross	 (To Rachel) So umm, where are the other guys?'
Rachel	 Umm, well let\xc2\x92s see Monica and Chandler are occupied.'
Ross	 Fighting?!'
Rachel	 No, the other thing. I really think it\xc2\x92s great they work things\nout.'
Ross	 Yeah. There\xc2\x92s no breaking them up, is there?'
Rachel	 Hey, can I borrow the key to your house so I can run across the street\nand make a copy?'
Ross	 Sure! Here. (Hands her his keys.)'
Rachel	 Thank you. (Gets up) Now are you sure? Because once I make a copy,\nthere\xc2\x92s no turning back.'
Ross	 Yeah, I\xc2\x92m-I\xc2\x92m sure. (Deadpan) Yeah, get out of here before I\nchange my mind. (She exits)'
Joey	 Umm, listen, Ross do you really think this moving in with Rachel is a good\nidea?'
Ross	 I\xc2\x92ve been back and forth.'
Joey	 Yeah well, maybe you should go back! Okay? Rachel moves in, and before you\nknow it you\xc2\x92re right where you don\xc2\x92t want to be! Back together!'
Ross	 Ehh, I don\xc2\x92t, I don\xc2\x92t think so. She\xc2\x92s already talked about\ny\xc2\x92know, dating other guys.'
Joey	 That\xc2\x92s not gonna work out! Then she\xc2\x92s gonna come home all weepy\nand you\xc2\x92ll be tellin\xc2\x92 her, "Oh that\xc2\x92s okay. You\xc2\x92ll find\nsomeone." And then, bamn! She finds you!'

Rachel	 Well, it would be easier to move just right across the hall. Wait a\nminute, unless you\xc2\x92re thinking about Naked Wednesday\xc2\x92s.'
Joey	 Thursday\xc2\x92s clearly not good for ya, pick a day!'

Joey	 (opening the door to The Potential Roommate) Hi!'
