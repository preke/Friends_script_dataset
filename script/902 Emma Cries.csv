Ross	 You said you\xc2\x92d marry Joey?'
Rachel	 Okay you have to realize, I was exhausted, I was emotional, I would have\nsaid yes to anybody. Like that time you and I got married! (Pause) I\xc2\x92m not helping.'
Ross	 So you said yes to him, and you just had our baby?'
Rachel	 That is right and traditionally the daddy is supposed to give the mummy\na present but I am prepared to let that go.'
Ross	 So when I came in here to see if you wanted to maybe start things up\nagain, you were engaged to my best friend.'
Rachel	 Well\xc2\x97Really? I thought Chandler was your best friend.'
Ross	 Well, Chandler\xc2\x92s my oldest friend, but Joey\xc2\x92s my\xc2\x97No! Ah!\n(points at Rachel)'
Rachel	 Ooooo!'
Joey	 (Enters) Hey you guys I\xc2\x92m gonna take off. I just wanted to let you\nguys know, say goodbye.'
Ross	 Rachel said she\xc2\x92d marry you?!'
Joey	 (He looks around the room) This isn\xc2\x92t the right room, sorry folks.\n(leaves)'

Monica	 Ok, I don\xc2\x92t wanna be negative so I\xc2\x92ll say that most of the\nsigns you bought are good.'
Phoebe	 No they ran out of "It\xc2\x92s a girl" but I can fix this one,\n(She writes "not" in between it\xc2\x92s and a) See?'
Monica	 (looking at Chandler sleeping with a balloon in his mouth) So sexy.\n(Waking him up.) Honey.'
Chandler	 Yea yea. (Pulls the balloon out of his mouth)'
Monica	 Honey why don\xc2\x92t you go lie down.'
Chandler	 No, no, Ross and Rachel will be back soon and then I gotta go to the\noffice (Pulls another balloon out of his mouth) Am I producing them?'
Joey	 Why\xc2\x92re you so tired?'
Chandler	 Couldn\xc2\x92t sleep last night you know, then I started worrying about\nthis big divisional meeting that I have later today, the more I worried about it the more\nI couldn\xc2\x92t sleep.\xc2\xa0 Y\xc2\x92know? I was like, if I fall asleep now I\xc2\x92ll get\nsix hours sleep, but if I fall asleep now I\xc2\x92ll get five hours sleep. Not matter what\nI did I couldn\xc2\x92t fall asleep.'
Joey	 You know what you should\xc2\x92ve done, you should have told yourself that\nlittle story.'
Rachel	 (enters with Emma) Hi!'
Everyone	 Hi, welcome home!'
Monica	 Phoebe did the signs!'
Rachel	 Oh you guys thanks for doing this.'
Phoebe	 Look at all the stuff people sent!'
Rachel	 Oh Ah! (Sees a big stuffed gorilla) Oh my gosh there\xc2\x92s something\nevery mother needs, a giant stuffed gorilla that takes up the entire apartment! What are\npeople think\xc2\x85 (Reads the card) Oh you guys I love it.'
Joey	 Hey so where\xc2\x92s Ross?'
Rachel	 He\xc2\x92s downstairs getting the rest of the stuff out of the cab.'
Joey	 Is he still mad at us?'
Rachel	 Well, you more then me, but he can\xc2\x92t stay to mad at me. I mean, I\njust had his baby.'
Joey	 That\xc2\x92s not fair! I can\xc2\x92t do that.'
Rachel	 Yeah, I\xc2\x92m not so sure you should be here when he comes up.'
Joey	 See this is what I was afraid of, I didn\xc2\x92t think I should be here\neither but somebody (Looks at Chandler) said he\xc2\x92d be over it by now.'
Chandler	 Hey, what do I know? I wanted to get a bigger gorilla.'
Ms. McKenna	 The numbers we are seeing New York, Chicago, and London are\nconsistently solid, but many of our officers have reported disappointing fields.'
Ms. McKenna	 Boston is down, Atlanta is down, Houston is down, I could go on and\non but instead of boring you I\xc2\x92ll go straight to my forty two point plan.'
Chandler	 Walter (nods).'
Phoebe	 She\xc2\x92s just so cute! I just wanna bite her ear off and use it and a\nsucking candy.'
Monica	 Phoebe! But I could take one of those little feet and put it in a pita\npocket.'
Ross	 (enters from the bed room) Okay I put most of the stuff away.'
Rachel	 Oh great, the pacifiers?'
Ross	 In the closet.'
Rachel	 The burping clogs?'
Ross	 Linen closet.'
Rachel	 The diapers?'
Ross	 In the hospital.'
Phoebe	 Wow you guys got a hospital?\xc2\xa0 Fancy!'
Ross	 No I left the diapers at the hospital! There\xc2\x92s some in the bag but\nI\xc2\x92ll run out and get some more.'
Rachel	 Alright thanks, oh Ross could you stop by the coffee house and get me a\nmuffin?'
Ross	 Sure what kind?'
Rachel	 Umm let me think...What do I want, what d-o I w-a-n-t...'
Ross	 Please take your time, it\xc2\x92s an important decision. Not like, say, I\nknow! deciding to marry someone, this is about a muffin.'
Rachel	 Blueberry.'
Ross	 Blueberry it is.'
Rachel	 Thanks.'
Monica	 Wow, he\xc2\x92s really not letting this go, is he?'
Rachel	 God how long do you think that\xc2\x92s gonna last?'
Phoebe	 I dunno, well he got over the "We were on a break" thing\nreally quickly.'
Rachel	 Y\xc2\x92know I can\xc2\x92t even worry about that right now, cause I got\nthe cutie little baby, oh I can\xc2\x92t believe how much I love her, I can\xc2\x92t get\nenough of her, like right now I miss her.\xc2\xa0 I actually miss her.'
Phoebe	 You know that\xc2\x92s\xc2\x85 that\xc2\x92s her.'
Rachel	 Oh god look at her sleeping.\xc2\xa0 Oh, I love her so much!\xc2\xa0 Oh, I\nthink I\xc2\x92m gonna wake her up.'
Phoebe	 Oh no, Rach, no no, you know you\xc2\x92re never supposed\nto wake a sleeping baby.'
Rachel	 Well I can do whatever I want!\xc2\xa0 I made her! (Waking Emma up.) Come\non little girl, hi!'
Phoebe	 I can say I told you so but she\xc2\x92s kinda doing that for me.'
Rachel	 Oh I\xc2\x92m sorry mummy\xc2\x92s so sorry go back to sleep go back to\nsleep. Shh. \xc2\xa0 Shhh! Go back to sleep'
Monica	 Breaks your heart doesn\xc2\x92t it'
Phoebe	 It really does\xc2\x85 how long do you think we have to stay?'
Ms. McKenna	 Ok if everyone\xc2\x92s on board, it\xc2\x92s settled, Chandler,\n(Walter puts his hand on Chandlers hand, Chandler sleeping puts his hand on top of his, he\nthen wakes up and pulls his hand away) Chandler?'
Chandler	 Yep.'
Ms. McKenna	 Are you on board?'
Chandler	 (not knowing what he\xc2\x92s saying yes to) Yes.'
Ms. McKenna	 Then, problem solved. Chandler will be running our office in Tulsa.\nYou\xc2\x92re gonna love Oklahoma.'
Phoebe	 Well, alright, we already tried feeding her, changing her, burping her,\noh try this one! Go back in time and listen to Phoebe!'
Monica	 Alright here\xc2\x92s something, it says to try holding the baby close to\nyour body and then swing her rapidly from side to side.'
Rachel	 Ok. (Starts swinging Emma rapidly and she stops crying)'
Monica	 It worked!'
Rachel	 Oh (happy) oh no just stopped to throw up a little bit. (Emma starts\ncrying again.) Oh come on, what am I gonna do, its been hours and it won\xc2\x92t stop\ncrying.'
Monica	 Umm, she Rach, not it, she. '
Rachel	 Yeah, I\xc2\x92m not so sure.'
Monica	 Oh my god, I am losing my mind.'
Phoebe	 Yeah, no kidding, this just proves no good can come from having sex with\nRoss!'
Ross	 Hey Gunther, can I get a couple of blueberry muffins to go? (He puts a bag\nwith diapers in it on the counter.)'
Gunther	 Diapers huh?'
Ross	 Yep.'
Gunther	 So I guess Rachel had you baby?'
Ross	 Yep, can you believe it?'
Gunther	 Nope!\xc2\xa0 I still can\xc2\x92t believe she slept with you in the first\nplace.'
Ross	 Huh? Ooh (laughs) you mean like a\xc2\x85 Huh?'
Joey	 (entering) Hey. (Ross turns to see who it is, and seeing it\xc2\x92s Joey he\njust ignores him and turns back around.) Ross, I know you\xc2\x92re pissed at me, but we\nhave to talk about this.'
Ross	 Ah actually we don\xc2\x92t. (Ross walks off) '
Joey	\xc2\xa0 Fine, fine okay.\xc2\xa0 But I gotta say technically, I\ndidn\xc2\x92t even do anything wrong.'
Ross	 (turns back) What! (Angrily) You didn\xc2\x92t do anything wrong?!'
Joey	 I said I didn\xc2\x92t technically.'
Ross	 Okay let\xc2\x92s put aside that you (Makes quote marks with his fingers.)\n"accidentally" picked up my grandmothers ring and you (Does it again)\n"accidentally" proposed to Rachel.'
Joey	 Look, can I just stop you right there for a second? When people do this\n(Makes quote marks with his fingers.) I don\xc2\x92t really know what that means. (Ross just\nlooks at him) You were saying?'
Ross	 And I can even understand that you couldn\xc2\x92t tell Rachel, but why\ncouldn\xc2\x92t you tell me, huh? You had all day to and you didn\xc2\x92t.'
Joey	 I know I should\xc2\x92ve. (Makes quote marks again.) "I\xc2\x92m\nsorry." '
Ross	 Not using it right, Joe.'
Ross	 I\xc2\x92m gonna go.'
Joey	 No, come on Ross! (He grabs his bag so he can\xc2\x92t leave) Look, Ross, we\nhave to get past this.'
Ross	 Give me the bag.'
Joey	 No, look, I don\xc2\x92t know what else to do. I said I\xc2\x92m sorry!'
Ross	 Joey!'
Joey	 You should scream at me, or-or-or curse me, or hit me.'
Ross	 I\xc2\x92m not gonna hit you.'
Joey	 Why not?\xc2\xa0 You\xc2\x92ll feel better!\xc2\xa0 I\xc2\x92ll feel better, and\nyou know you want to. I can see it in your eyes.'
Ross	 No I don\xc2\x92t.'

Joey	 (shouts) Hit me! Hit me! '
Ross	 You ducked!!'
Joey	 I\xc2\x92m sorry! It was a reflex! '
Ross	 Oh my god, this really hurts!!!'
Joey	 I couldn\xc2\x92t help it! When a fist comes at your face, you duck! Look!\n(He goes to punch Ross, expecting him to duck, but he doesn\xc2\x92t and Joey punches Ross.\n\xc2\xa0 Gunther is amused.)'
Ross	 What is the matter with you?!?'
Joey	 You were supposed to duck!!! Why didn\xc2\x92t you duck?'
Ross	 Why don\xc2\x92t we talk about this on the way to the hospital?'
Joey	 Good, good yeah, (Grabs the bags) maybe while we\xc2\x92re there, they can\ncheck your reflexes. (Joey opens the door and it hits Ross in the face with it.) (Makes\nquote marks.) "Oops."'

Monica	 Try feeding her again.'
Rachel	 I already fed her.'
Monica	 I know, that\xc2\x92s why I said again!'
Phoebe	 Alright you guys, we can\xc2\x92t turn on each other, Okay?\xc2\xa0\nThat\xc2\x92s just what she wants.'

Rachel	 Oh no, you guys, just stay here, I\xc2\x92m gonna go check her diaper,\nPheebs you wanna come?'

Chandler	 Actually Pheebs its more of a husband and wife kinda thing'
Phoebe	 I knew I should have married Chandler.'
Monica	 Okay what\xc2\x92s up'
Chandler	 Umm, you know how we always said that it would be fun to move to Paris\nfor a year? You know, you could study French cooking and I could write and we could take a\npicnic along the Seine and go wine tasting in Bordeaux?'
Monica	 Oh yeah (smiles).'
Chandler	 Okay, you know how that people say that Tulsa is the Paris of\nOklahoma?'
Monica	 What? Who says that?'
Chandler	 People who\xc2\x92ve never ever been to Paris.'
Monica	 What\xc2\x92s going on?'
Chandler	 We\xc2\x92re moving to Tulsa! (Makes a excited expression on his face)'
Monica	 Excuse me?'
Chandler	 Okay, Ms. McKenna, she kind of works above my boss, she asked me to\nmove to Tulsa and be the president of our office there, and I was sleeping and apparently,\nsaid yes.'
Monica	 (stands up angry) Tulsa, Oklahoma!'
Chandler	 The Sooner State, whatever that is.'
Monica	 Chandler, I don\xc2\x92t even wanna see the musical Oklahoma!'
Chandler	 Really? Oh What A Beautiful Morning!\xc2\xa0 Surrey With A\nFringe On Top.'
Monica	 Are you trying to tell me that we\xc2\x92re moving to Oklahoma, or that\nyou\xc2\x92re gay? All right, not that this matters, but did they at least offer you a huge\nraise?'
Chandler	 No, no, but they are going to lease us a Ford Focus. (Monica\xc2\x92s\nnot impressed.) I\xc2\x92ll get out of it.'
Monica	 Thank you.'
Chandler	 (hears Emma crying) What is wrong with Emma?'
Monica	 Oh she misunderstood, she thought she was moving to Tulsa.'
Chandler	 Umm ma\xc2\x92am, do you have a minute? (She points for him to come in)\nI kind of have some bad news. I don\xc2\x92t think I can move to Tulsa.'
Ms. McKenna	 What?'
Chandler	 It\xc2\x92s a funny story, actually. (coughs) I kind of fell asleep in\nthe meeting this morning so when I said I\xc2\x92d move to Tulsa, I didn\xc2\x92t really know\nwhat I was saying.'
Ms. McKenna	 You fell asleep?'
Chandler	 But only because I was up all night worried about this meeting,\nain\xc2\x92t that funny? Irony? Not a fan, alright (he sits down). See, here\xc2\x92s the\nthing. I went home and told my wife about Tulsa and she won\xc2\x92t go. See, me, I love\nTulsa!\xc2\xa0 Tulsa is heaven!\xc2\xa0 Tulsa is Italy\xc2\x97Please don\xc2\x92t make me go\nthere!'
Ms. McKenna	 Chandler, I\xc2\x85'
Chandler	 No no no! Look, Carol, can I call you Carol? (Pause) Wh-why would I\nwhen your name is Elaine? Oh what a great picture of your son, strapping! (She glares at\nhim.) That\xc2\x92s a picture of your daughter, isn\xc2\x92t it, well she\xc2\x92s lovely. I\nlike a girl with a strong jaw. I\xc2\x92ll call you from Tulsa. (Exits.)'
Joey	 Hey, so how is it?'
Ross	 I broke my thumb.'
Joey	 Your thumb? That\xc2\x92s weird. (Makes a fist.) You sure you\xc2\x92re\npunching right? Make a fist. (Ross just looks at him with his thumb in a cast.) Maybe\nlater. Ross I feel terrible.'
Ross	 You know what, you can go, I just have to fill out some forms. (Tries to\nhold the pen but can\xc2\x92t)'
Joey	 You, you want me to help you with that?'
Ross	 Why, does it look like I\xc2\x92m having trouble with my misshapen claw? (He\nhands Joey the form)'
Joey	 Name? (Ross looks at him.) I know Ross but what\xc2\x92s it short for? You\nknow like, like Rossel or Rosstepher.'

Ross	 I don\xc2\x92t think that we are.'
Joey	 But you two were supposed to be together.'
Ross	 Well, I thought so too, but then she said she\xc2\x92d marry you.'
Joey	 Come on, Ross, that didn\xc2\x92t mean anything! She just had the baby, she\nwas all freaked out about doing it alone, she would have said yes to anybody.'
Ross	 Yeah that\xc2\x92s what she said.'
Joey	 So?'
Ross	 So I don\xc2\x92t wanna be just anybody.'
Joey	 Wow.'
Ross	 You know what, it\xc2\x92s, it\xc2\x92s better this way anyway. I mean I\ndon\xc2\x92t know what I was thinking, going down that road again with us. It\xc2\x92s just\nmuch easier if we\xc2\x92re just friends who have a kid.'
Joey	 Really?'
Ross	 Yeah.'
Joey	 And you\xc2\x92re Okay with that?'
Ross	 Yes. I mean, it\xc2\x92s what we always planned.\xc2\xa0 And if you have a\nplan, you should stick to it.\xc2\xa0 That\xc2\x92s why they call them plans.\xc2\xa0 Hello?\n(Pause) I\xc2\x92m fine.'
Joey	 Hey, for what it\xc2\x92s worth, with Rachel I don\xc2\x92t think you\xc2\x92ll\never be just (Makes quote marks.) "anybody."'
Ross	 Hey there you go! (Smiles because Joey used it correctly)'
Joey	 (makes quote marks) "Thanks."'
Rachel	 Oh my God! How long has she been crying?'
Monica	 About a week and a half.'
Phoebe	 Well alright, looks like you guys have got it under control so I\xc2\x92m\njust gonna go. (She gets up and Rachel looks at her, upset, and Monica just stares.) No!\nReally? Misery really does love company. All right! (She sits back down.)'
Monica	 Rach, try holding her a different way.'
Rachel	 You guys, I\xc2\x92m doing the best I can, anyone else is welcome to try.'
Phoebe	 Alright, I\xc2\x92ll try, fine! Yes, Okay!'
Rachel	 Here you go. (Hands Emma to Phoebe)'
Phoebe	 Shh! Nothing works with this child! (Hands her back.)'
Rachel	 Oh god what am I gonna do you guys, I can\xc2\x92t even comfort my own\nbaby! I\xc2\x92m the worst mother ever!'
Monica	 You\xc2\x92re just new at this, it\xc2\x92ll get better, think about your\nfirst day at work. I mean, that couldn\xc2\x92t have been easy but you figured that out.'
Rachel	 Yeah I don\xc2\x92t think dressing provocatively is going to help me here!\nOh my god just please take her.'
Monica	 Okay I\xc2\x92ll take her, here. (Takes Emma)'
Rachel	 I have to go to the bathroom. (Goes to the bathroom)'
Phoebe	 I have to go scream into a pillow. (Goes to scream into a pillow)'
Monica	 (To Emma) Bouncy baby, Bouncy baby, Ooh baby baby, Ooh baby baby, Ooh\nbaby baby. (Emma stops crying and falls asleep)'
Phoebe	 (entering) Have I gone deaf?'
Monica	 It worked! Ooh baby baby baby, ooh baby baby baby!'
Phoebe	 You must be a fireball in bed.'
Monica	 I can\xc2\x92t believe it!\xc2\xa0 She\xc2\x92s asleep!\xc2\xa0 I got her to go\nto sleep! \xc2\xa0 I have actual magical powers!'
Phoebe	 I can hear traffic and birds!\xc2\xa0 I can hear the voices in my head\nagain! (Monica looks at her strangely) I\xc2\x92m kidding. (She smiles wickedly.)'
Rachel	 Oh my God! You got her to stop crying!'
Monica	 Yes I did, I\xc2\x92m Monica, Super Aunt'
Rachel	 You are the official baby crier stopper!'
Monica	 Yes I am!!'
Rachel	 You\xc2\x92re never leaving the apartment!'
Monica	 Say what?'
Rachel	 That\xc2\x92s your new job, day and night, she starts crying I need you\nhere.'
Monica	 (stands up to hand Emma back) Oh no no no no!'
Phoebe	 Thankfully you don\xc2\x92t need me at all (gets up and to leave) so Okay\nSuper aunt see you later! Rachel let\xc2\x92s give it six to eight months (she leaves).'
Rachel	 Okay so listen I\xc2\x92m gonna go lay down.'
Monica	 What?'
Rachel	 You know the book says that whenever she\xc2\x92s sleeping I should be\nsleeping so\xc2\x85 (She gives Monica thumbs and goes to lay down)'

Monica	 No.'
Chandler	 We\xc2\x92re moving to Tulsa'
Monica	 (loudly) What!?'
Chandler	 Shhhh! Shhhhh! Shhhhh! Shhhhh! (Walks backwards towards the door) I\ncan\xc2\x92t, I can\xc2\x92t hear you. (He runs out)'
Ross	 Hey.'
Rachel	 Heeeeey, where have you been? (He shows her his thumb) What happened to\nyou?'
Ross	 Ah I had a little thing with Joey, if you think this is bad you should see\nhim.'
Rachel	 Oh no Ross! This is not good, we have to talk about this Joey thing.\nPlease sit. (He sits) You have got to get over this Joey thing, okay? I never really\nwanted to marry Joey, okay?'
Ross	 Okay.'
Rachel	 You know what I really really want?'
Ross	 What, Rach?'
Rachel	 I wanna sleep, I wanna eat, I wanna take a shower, I mean before she\nwakes up and we gotta do this all over again.'
Ross	 (smiles) Right.'
Rachel	 I mean I got news for you mister, Emma?\xc2\xa0 Not easy.'
Ross	 Well, that\xc2\x92s what I\xc2\x92m here for. (Emma starts crying again) Want\nme to get that?'
Rachel	 No its really okay\xc2\x85 Monica!'
Monica	 (comes running out the kitchen to the bedroom) Got it! Got it! Got it!\nGot it! Got it! Got it!'

Joey	 You know, ah, I\xc2\x92ve been thinking about this and I gotta tell ya,\nit\xc2\x92s not my fault. It\xc2\x92s a natural instinct.'
Chandler	 (enters) Hey, what you guys talking about?'
Joey	 Hey OK great, what would you do if I did this? (Swings to punch Chandler,\nhe moves and he ends up punching Ross, knocking him off the stool. Ross then gets up and\njust stares at Joey.)'
