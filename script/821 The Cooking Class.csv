Ross	 Hey you guys I got some bad news. (He sets the stack of papers down on the\ntable.)'
Phoebe	 Well that\xc2\x92s no way to sell newspapers. Why don\xc2\x92t you try,\n"Extra! Extra! Read all about it!"'
Ross	 No, Monica\xc2\x92s restaurant got a horrible review in the Post. (They all\ngasp.) I didn\xc2\x92t want her to see it, so I ran around the neighborhood and bought all\nthe copies I could find. (He hands the paper to Phoebe and they all read it.)'
Joey	 Man, this is bad! And I\xc2\x92ve had my share of bad reviews. I still\nremember my first good one though. (Quoting) "Everything else in this production of Our\nTown was simply terrible. Joey Tribbiani was abysmal."'
Monica	 (entering) Hey!'
Chandler	 Hey.'
Monica	 (seeing the stack of newspapers) Oh my God! Look at all the newspapers!\nIt must be a good review! Is it great?!'
Ross	 Umm\xc2\x85'
Monica	 (reading) Oh dear God!'
Ross	 But the good news is, no one in a two-block radius will ever know.'
Monica	 What about the rest of Manhattan?!'
Ross	 Yeah, they all know.'
Monica	 Oh my God, this is horrible!'
Chandler	 I\xc2\x92m so sorry.'
Monica	 I\xc2\x92m so humiliated!'
Rachel	 Yeah but y\xc2\x92know what they say Mon, "There\xc2\x92s no such thing\nas bad press."'
Monica	 You don\xc2\x92t think that umm, (reading) "The chef\xc2\x92s Mahi Mahi\nwas awful awful," is bad press?'
Rachel	 I didn\xc2\x92t write it.'
Monica	 Is he right? Am I really\xc2\x97Am I awful?'
All	 No!'
Joey	 Yeah! Yeah Monica! You listen to me, okay? And I\xc2\x92m not just saying\nthis because I\xc2\x92m your friend, I\xc2\x92m sayin\xc2\x92 it \xc2\x91cause it\xc2\x92s the\ntruth. You\xc2\x92re food is abysmal!'

Rachel	 Ross!'
Ross	 (startling him) What?! What?'
Rachel	 I am freaking out!'
Ross	 Are ya?'
Rachel	 My due date is in one week! '
Ross	 What are you doing up?'
Rachel	 That is seven days!'
Ross	 Okay look, I had a lot of water before I went to bed. Can we do this\nafter\xc2\x85'
Rachel	 (interrupting him) No-no-no-no-no Ross! Please, come on we do not have\nany of the big stuff we need! We do not a changing table! We do not have a crib! We do not\nhave a diaper service!'
Ross	 It\xc2\x92s funny you should mention diapers.'
Rachel	 I\xc2\x92m serious.'
Ross	 Okay look, there\xc2\x92s nothing to worry about. We have plenty of time.\nThere\xc2\x92s a great baby furniture store on west 10th. Tomorrow, we will go\nthere and we will get you everything that you need. Okay?'
Rachel	 Okay. Thank you. That\xc2\x92s great. Thank you. Wait-wait! Where on west\n10th? Because there\xc2\x92s this really cute shoe store that has like this\nlittle\xc2\x85'
Ross	 (interrupting her) Okay. Okay. If uh, if you\xc2\x92re gonna do this, then\nI\xc2\x92m gonna do that. (Points to the bathroom.) So\xc2\x85 (Starts for the bathroom.)'
Rachel	 (stopping him) Oh, wait Ross! I\xc2\x92m sorry, one more thing!'
Ross	 (annoyed) Yeah!'
Rachel	 Umm, our situation. Y\xc2\x92know umm, what we mean to each other. And I\nmean we-we\xc2\x92re having this baby together, and we live together. Isn\xc2\x92t that,\nisn\xc2\x92t that weird?'
Ross	 (stunned) (thinks) Well uh\xc2\x85'
Rachel	 I\xc2\x92m just kidding! You can go pee! (He does so in a hurry.)'
Joey	 (entering) Hey uh Monica, I can\xc2\x92t remember. Did we say we were gonna\nmeet here or at the movies?'
Monica	 We said at the movies, but\xc2\x85'
Joey	 Okay, I\xc2\x92ll see you there. (Starts to leave) '
Monica	 Joey! (He returns) Now that you\xc2\x92re here\xc2\x85'
Joey	 Sure, I can hang out \xc2\x91til I have to meet ya. (To Chandler) What\nuh\xc2\x97How come you\xc2\x92re not going?'
Chandler	 I have a job interview I have to get ready for.'
Joey	 I thought you already have a job.'
Chandler	 And people say you don\xc2\x92t pay attention. No, this is a much better\njob. It\xc2\x92s vice-president of a company that does data reconfiguration and statistical\nfactoring for other companies.'
Joey	 Wow! How do you know how to do that?!'
Chandler	 That\xc2\x92s what I do now.'
Monica	 Hey Joey, come taste this.'
Joey	 What is it?'
Monica	 Remember that guy that gave me a bad review? Well\xc2\x85 (Feeds him a\nspoonful of what she\xc2\x92s cooking.) I\xc2\x92m getting my revenge!'
Joey	 You cooked him?'
Monica	 No. He teaches a course on food criticism at the New School, so before\nwe go to the movies I wanna go by there and make him try my bouillabaisse again. Oh, I\ncannot wait to read the front page of the Post tomorrow! "Restaurant reviewer admits
Chandler	 The front page? You really do live in your own little world,\ndon\xc2\x92t ya?'
Cashier	 Do you uh, want these things delivered Mr. and Mrs. Geller?'
Rachel	 Oh.'
Ross	 Oh.'
Rachel	 No-no-no! No, no, no, we\xc2\x92re not married.'
Ross	 We are having a baby together, but we\xc2\x92re not involved. (The cashier,\na very beautiful woman, looks confused) I mean, uh we-we were seeing each other a while\nago, but then we were just friends. And then there was one drunken night. (Rachel looks at\nhim angrily) Or, yes stranger, we\xc2\x92d like this delivered please.'
Cashier	 Why don\xc2\x92t you fill out this address card. (Hands him one.)'
Ross	 Oh, okay.'
Cashier	 I notice you picked out a lot of our dinosaur items.'
Rachel	 Oh yeah! Actually, that\xc2\x92s one of the reasons why we\xc2\x92re not a\ncouple.'
Ross	 I chose those, I\xc2\x92m a paleontologist.'
Cashier	 Really?! That is so cool!'
Rachel	 Oh. Oh yeah, don\xc2\x92t get to worked up over it. I mean it-it sounds\nlike he\xc2\x92s a doctor, but he\xc2\x92s not.'
Cashier	 Oh no-no, I\xc2\x92m fascinated by paleontology. Have you read the new\nWalter Alvarez book?'
Ross	 Yeah! I-I teach it in my class.'
Rachel	 Oh my God! I\xc2\x92m standing at a cash register, holding a credit card,\nand I\xc2\x92m bored.'
Cashier	 (looking at the completed address card) Oh, I love your neighborhood.\nThere\xc2\x92s a great gym right around the corner from your building.'
Ross	 That\xc2\x92s my gym.'
Cashier	 I can tell you work out. (Ross is please and Rachel looks at him\nconfused.) A paleontologist who works out, you\xc2\x92re like Indiana Jones. (Rachel has a\ndisbelieving look on her face.)'
Ross	 I am like Indiana Jones.'
Rachel	 Hi Pheebs!'
Phoebe	 Hey! Oh, how did baby shopping go?'
Rachel	 Oh, it was great! We got everything that we needed! Oh and Ross, almost\ngot something that wasn\xc2\x92t on the list. A whore.'
Phoebe	 What?!'
Rachel	 Well, we were paying for our stuff and this saleswoman just started\nflirting with him.'
Phoebe	 Well did she know you two weren\xc2\x92t married?'
Rachel	 Yeah.'
Phoebe	 Oh my God! Well the idea of a woman flirting with a-with a single man,\nwe-we must alert the church elders!'
Rachel	 You don\xc2\x92t understand! You didn\xc2\x92t see how brazen she was.'
Phoebe	 Sounds like you\xc2\x92re a little jealous.'
Rachel	 No! I\xc2\x92m not! I-I-I just think it\xc2\x92s wrong! It\xc2\x92s-it\xc2\x92s\nthat I\xc2\x92m\xc2\x97Here I am about to pop and he\xc2\x92s out picking up some shop girl at\nSluts \xc2\x91R\xc2\x92 Us!'
Phoebe	 Is that a real place? (Rachel\xc2\x92s stunned) Are they hiring?'
Chandler	 (entering) Hey Phoebe! (To Rachel) Fatty!'
Phoebe	 Hey Chandler, why so fancy?'
Chandler	 Well, I got a job interview. It\xc2\x92s kinda a big deal too. Its a lot\nmore money and I\xc2\x92d be doing data reconfiguration and statistical factoring.'
Phoebe	 Wait, I think I know someone who does that.'
Chandler	 Me! I do that. So\xc2\x85 Seriously, do I look okay? I\xc2\x92m little\nnervous.'
Rachel	 Oh yeah! You really\xc2\x97You look great.'
Phoebe	 Yeah, just don\xc2\x92t get your hopes up.'
Chandler	 Why not?'
Phoebe	 Well, the interview\xc2\x85'
Chandler	 What about it?'
Phoebe	 Y\xc2\x92know! You don\xc2\x92t make a very good first impression.'
Chandler	 (shocked) What?!'
Phoebe	 Oh you don\xc2\x92t know.'
Chandler	 Are you serious?!'
Phoebe	 Yes, when I first met you, you were like, "Blah, blah, blah."\nI was like, shhh!'
Chandler	 What is it that I do?'
Phoebe	 Well it\xc2\x92s just like you\xc2\x92re trying too hard. Always making\njokes, y\xc2\x92know, you just\xc2\x97You come off a little needy.'
Chandler	 (To Rachel) Did you like me when we first met?'
Rachel	 Chandler, I\xc2\x92m not gonna lie to ya, but I am gonna run away from\nyou. (Gets up and hurries out.)'
Monica	 Hi! Umm, I\xc2\x92m Monica Geller, I\xc2\x92m the chef at Alessandro\xc2\x92s.'
The Food Critic	 Still?'
Monica	 I think the things that you said about me are really unfair, and I would\nlike for you to give my bouillabaisse another chance.'
The Food Critic	 I don\xc2\x92t see any reason why I would do that to myself\nagain.'
Joey	 Either eat it, or be in it.'
Monica	 Spoon? (Hands him one and he tastes it.) So, what do you think?'
The Food Critic	 I\xc2\x92m torn, between my integrity and my desire to avoid a\nbeating. But I must be honest, your soap is abysmal. (Throws down the spoon and walks\nout.)'
Joey	 Thata girl! Huh? We should get out of here; there\xc2\x92s a new class\ncomin\xc2\x92 in.'
The Cooking Teacher	 Welcome to introduction to cooking. Now, before we start,\ncan anyone tell me the difference between a hollandaise sauce and a bearnaise sauce? (No\none can.)'
Monica	 I can.'
The Cooking Teacher	 Okay, go ahead.'
Monica	 Well umm, they both have a egg yolk and butter base, but a bearnaise has\nshallots, shirvel, and most importantly tarragon. '
The Cooking Teacher	 That\xc2\x92s very good, what\xc2\x92s your name?'
Monica	 Monica.'
The Cooking Teacher	 Monica, you go to the head of the class.'
Monica	 Okay. (Does so.)'
Rachel	 All this stuff takes up a lot of room. Hey how uh, how serious are you\nabout keeping Ben in your life?'
Ross	 My son? Pretty serious. (There\xc2\x92s a knock on the door and Ross answers\nit.) Oh hey Katie! (The cashier from before) What uh, what are you doing here?'
Katie	 Well, the delivery went out to you and I realized they forgot this. (A\nblanket.)'
Ross	 Ah, must\xc2\x92ve been fairly obvious since it was the only thing left in\nyour store.'
Katie	 Listen, to be honest, home deliveries are really a part of my job\ndescription.'
Ross	 Oh. (Reaches into his pocket for some money as Rachel enters the living\nroom and watches holding two stuffed dinosaurs.)'
Katie	 Oh uh\xc2\x85I actually came here to ask you out.'
Ross	 Oh! Wow! Uh, yeah! That sounds great. I\xc2\x92m just gonna put this (The\nmoney) back in my pocket, pretend that didn\xc2\x92t happen. Uh yeah, actually\nI\xc2\x92m free now. Do you wanna grab some coffee or\xc2\x85'
Katie	 Sure!'
Rachel	 Horny bitch. (They both look at her, pretending that the dinosaurs\nshe\xc2\x92s holding are arguing.) No! You\xc2\x92re a horny bitch! Noooo! You\xc2\x92re the\nhorny bitch! No! You\xc2\x92re a horny bitch!'

Rachel	 So you guys go, have a really good time.'
Ross	 (To Katie) Yeah, I\xc2\x92m just gonna grab my coat. And uh, and my whip.\n(Katie looks worried.) Y\xc2\x92know because of the Indiana Jones? (Katie laughs) Not-not\nbecause I\xc2\x92m-I\xc2\x92m into S&M. (Katie\xc2\x92s worried again.) I\xc2\x92m\nnot-I\xc2\x92m not into anything weird. Y\xc2\x92know? Just-just normal sex. (Katie is\nuncomfortable.) So, I\xc2\x92m gonna grab my coat. (Does so, leaving Katie and Rachel\nalone.)'
Rachel	 So, you had a good day huh? Big commission; picked up a daddy.'
Katie	 Are you okay with this?'
Rachel	 Oh yeah! Yeah please, you guys have fun.'
Katie	 Okay. It was nice to see you.'
Rachel	 Oh and it was great to see you too. And you look fantastic, although you\nmissed a button.'
Katie	 Oh umm, actually I umm\xc2\x85'
Rachel	 Oh okay, I see what you\xc2\x92re doing there.'
Chandler	 I can\xc2\x92t even believe this! I really come off that badly?'
Phoebe	 Oh! It\xc2\x92s okay, you calm down after a while and then people can see\nhow really sweet and wonderful you really are.'
Chandler	 Oh good. Good, because I\xc2\x92m sure this interview is gonna last a\ncouple of weeks.'
Phoebe	 All right, don\xc2\x92t freak out! Okay? I-I will help you. How\nlong before you have to leave?'
Chandler	 An hour.'
Phoebe	 I can\xc2\x92t help you.'
Chandler	 Phoebe!'
Phoebe	 All right, all right, we\xc2\x92ll just do our best. Okay? So let\xc2\x92s\nsay I\xc2\x92m the interviewer and I\xc2\x92m meeting you for the first time. Okay. "Hi!\nCome on in, I\xc2\x92m uh, Regina Philange."'
Chandler	 Chandler Bing.'
Phoebe	 Bing, what an unusual name.'
Chandler	 Well you should meet my uncle, Bada. (Pause) I\xc2\x92ll let myself out.'
Joey	 Hi.'
The Cooking Teacher	 Your Fettuccini Alfredo looks a little dry, did you use all\nyour cheese?'
Joey	 When you say used, do you mean eat as a pre-cooking snack?'
The Cooking Teacher	 And the cream?'
Joey	 Cheese makes me thirsty.'
The Cooking Teacher	 Okay. Let\xc2\x92s move on.'
Joey	 All right.'
The Cooking Teacher	 (To Monica) Oh! Something smells good over at Monica\xc2\x92s\nstation! (She tries Monica\xc2\x92s fettuccini.) Oh my God! This is absolutely amazing!\nYou\xc2\x92ve never made this before?'
Monica	 Oh no! I don\xc2\x92t know anything about cooking. I had to ask someone\nwhat it\xc2\x92s called when the, when the water makes those little bubbles.'
The Cooking Teacher	 Well, hats off to the chef.'
Monica	 I-I-I\xc2\x92m sorry, your-your mouth was full, I didn\xc2\x92t hear what\nyou said. Umm, hats off to who now?'
The Cooking Teacher	 The chef!'
Monica	 That\xc2\x92s right.'
Chandler	 \xc2\x85I think you\xc2\x92ll find if I come to work here, I don\xc2\x92t\nmicro-manage. I don\xc2\x92t shy away from delegating.'
Phoebe	 Um-hmm, that\xc2\x92s good to know. But let\xc2\x92s stop focusing on what\nyou don\xc2\x92t do, and start focusing on what you do do.'
Chandler	 (suppressing a smile) What I do do\xc2\x85is manage to uh, create an\natmosphere of support for the people working with me.'
Phoebe	 I see. Nice sidestep on the do do thing by the way.'
Chandler	 Hardest thing I\xc2\x92ve ever done in my life.'
Phoebe	 You gotta go!'
Chandler	 Oh! (Stands up.)'
Phoebe	 Okay, don\xc2\x92t worry. You\xc2\x92re ready.'
Chandler	 Really?'
Phoebe	 Absolutely! Just fight all your natural instincts and you\xc2\x92ll be\ngreat.'
Chandler	 Okay.'
The Cooking Teacher	 Ah Monica, my star student.'
Monica	 Y\xc2\x92know, you called me that before so I-I took the liberty of\nfashioning a star out of aluminum foil. Now, no pressure, you like my cookies, you give me\nthe star. (Hands it to her.)'
The Cooking Teacher	 (tasting the cookie and with her mouthful) Oh, yum-yum-yum.\n(Hands the star back.)'
Monica	 Wow! A star! (The class glares at her.) I know you all hate me and-and\nI\xc2\x92m sorry, but I don\xc2\x92t care.'
The Cooking Teacher	 Okay Joey, you\xc2\x92re up next. (Tries one of his cookies.)\nThis are good! This is amazing! You get an A!'
Joey	 I can an A? In-in school? (To Joey) Hey, I\xc2\x92m a dork.'
Monica	 Joey! I\xc2\x92m so proud of you!'
The Cooking Teacher	 I think you should give him your star.'
Monica	 Excuse me? He doesn\xc2\x92t even know what he\xc2\x92s doing!'
The Cooking Teacher	 We\xc2\x92re all beginners here. Nobody knows what\nthey\xc2\x92re doing.'
Monica	 I do! I\xc2\x92m a professional chef! (The class gasps.) Oh relax!\nIt\xc2\x92s not a courtroom drama!'
The Cooking Teacher	 If you\xc2\x92re a professional chef, what are you doing\ntaking Introduction to Cooking?'
Joey	 Yeah!'
Monica	 I\xc2\x92m-I\xc2\x92m sorry, it\xc2\x92s just that umm\xc2\x85 Well I-I cook at\nthis restaurant, Alessandro\xc2\x92s, and umm I just got a really bad review\xc2\x85'
The Cooking Teacher	 Oh Alessandro\xc2\x92s! I love that place!'
Monica	 You do?'
The Cooking Teacher	 Oh yes! You\xc2\x92re an excellent chef! As a person\nyou\xc2\x92re a little\xc2\x85'
Monica	 Oh, I\xc2\x92m totally crazy, but you-you like the food?'
The Cooking Teacher	 Very much.'
Monica	 Okay then, I don\xc2\x92t stink. I\xc2\x92m a good chef. Okay. (Starts to\nleave.)'
Joey	 Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! I don\xc2\x92t want to go. I\xc2\x92m having fun.'
The Cooking Teacher	 Well actually, did either of you pay for this class?'
Joey	 Hey-hey-hey, if my friend says it\xc2\x92s time to go, it\xc2\x92s time to go.\n(Starts to leave, but comes back for his cookies.)'
Chandler	 \xc2\x85also I was the point person on my company\xc2\x92s transition from\nthe KL-5 to GR-6 system.'
The Interviewer	 You must\xc2\x92ve had your hands full.'
Chandler	 That I did. That I did.'
The Interviewer	 So let\xc2\x92s talk a little bit about your duties.'
Chandler	 (nervous) My duties? (Trying not to crack a joke) All right.'
The Interviewer	 Now you\xc2\x92ll be heading a whole division, so you\xc2\x92ll\nhave a lot of duties.'
Chandler	 (trying not to laugh) I see.'
The Interviewer	 But there\xc2\x92ll be perhaps 30 people under you so you can\ndump a certain amount on them.'
Chandler	 (really try not to laugh) Good to know.'
The Interviewer	 We can go into detail\xc2\x85'
Chandler	 No don\xc2\x92t I beg of you!'
The Interviewer	 All right then, we\xc2\x92ll have a definite answer for you on\nMonday, but I think I can say with some confidence, you\xc2\x92ll fit in well here.'
Chandler	 (relieved) Really?!'
The Interviewer	 Absolutely. (They walk to the door.) You can relax; you did\ngreat.'
Chandler	 Yeah I gotta say thank you, I was really nervous. Y\xc2\x92know\nI\xc2\x92ve been told I come on to strong, make to many jokes, and then it was really hard\nto sidestep that duty thing. (The interviewer doesn\xc2\x92t understand) Duties. (Still\ndoesn\xc2\x92t.) Duties! (Still doesn\xc2\x92t.) Poo. (Still doesn\xc2\x92t.)'
The Interviewer	 Poo?'
Chandler	 Oh my God this doesn\xc2\x92t count! Okay? The interview was over, that\nwas the real Chandler Bing in there, this is just some crazy guy out in the hall! Call\nsecurity! There\xc2\x92s a crazy guy out in the hall!'
The Interviewer	 Poo?!'
Chandler	 I\xc2\x92ll look forward to your call. (Walks away.)'
Ross	 Hey.'
Rachel	 Hi! You\xc2\x92re back from your date!'
Ross	 How are you?'
Rachel	 I\xc2\x92m fine, but that\xc2\x92s not important. What\xc2\x92s important is\nhow was she?'
Ross	 Uhh, it was fun. We, we just had coffee.'
Rachel	 Oh uh-huh, uh-huh, coffee, a little rub-rub-rub under the table.'
Ross	 What\xc2\x92s uh, what\xc2\x92s going on? Do you not, do you not like Katie?'
Rachel	 No! No, she\xc2\x92s\xc2\x97She was nice. I mean, she\xc2\x92s a little\nslutty, but who isn\xc2\x92t?'
Ross	 I liked her.'
Rachel	 Of course you did Ross, you would date a gorilla if it called you\nIndiana Jones!'
Ross	 Did you get like a fresh batch of pregnancy hormones today?!'
Rachel	 No! It\xc2\x92s just that, Kate bothered me. '
Ross	 Why? What was wrong with her?'
Rachel	 There was nothing wrong with her! All right? She was perfectly lovely!'
Ross	 Okay, so what\xc2\x92s the matter?'
Rachel	 I don\xc2\x92t want you to date her!'
Ross	 (laughs) Why? What, what are you jealous?'
Rachel	 Yes! And not because I want you to go out with me, but because I\ndon\xc2\x92t want you to go out with anybody! Okay? I know it\xc2\x92s a terrible thing to\neven think this, and it\xc2\x92s completely inappropriate, but I want you to be at my\nconstant beck and call 24 hours a day! I\xc2\x92m very sorry, but that is just the way that\nI feel.'
Ross	 Okay.'
Rachel	 What?!'
Ross	 I won\xc2\x92t date. I\xc2\x92ll uh, I\xc2\x92ll be here, with you, all the\ntime.'
Rachel	 Really? But I\xc2\x92m being so unreasonable.'
Ross	 True, but you\xc2\x92re allowed to be unreasonable. You\xc2\x92re having our\nbaby.'
Rachel	 (starting to cry) Oh Ross, thank you. Thank you. (They hug.)'
Ross	 Do you feel better?'
Rachel	 No, not really. You\xc2\x92re pressing the baby into my bladder and now I\nhave to pee. Sorry. (She gets up and starts for the bathroom.)'
Ross	 Uh Rach?'
Rachel	 Yeah. (Stops and starts doing the I-have-to-go-to-the-bathroom dance.)'
Ross	 Just one thing umm\xc2\x85'
Rachel	 Uh-huh.'
Ross	 We live together. You\xc2\x92re having our baby. I\xc2\x92m not gonna see\nanybody else. Are you-are you sure you don\xc2\x92t want something more?'
Rachel	 (pause) Wow! I don\xc2\x92t know, maybe. I\xc2\x92m\xc2\x85'
Ross	 Oh-oh, Rach! I was just messin\xc2\x92 around! (She\xc2\x92s stunned) Like you\ndid last night when I had to pee?'
Rachel	 (laughs) I knew that! I knew that! I was just messin\xc2\x92 with you too!\n'
Ross	 (pause) Okay. Okay. Because for a minute you said you\xc2\x85'
Rachel	 Oh no-no-no-no, no!'
Ross	 \xc2\x85that you actually\xc2\x85'
Rachel	 No that\xc2\x92s just\xc2\x97(Laughs)\xc2\x97That\xc2\x92s just \xc2\x91cause\nI\xc2\x92m such a good messer!'
Ross	 Rach?'
Rachel	 Yeah?'
Ross	 The bathroom?'
Rachel	 Right! (Heads for the bathroom.)'

Joey	 Well I had a great time! Learned how to bake, ate great food, that\xc2\x92s\nthe first A I\xc2\x92ve gotten since seventh grade, and I didn\xc2\x92t have to sleep\nwith the teacher this time.'
Monica	 Oh, look! Acting for Beginners! Want to feel good about yourself?'
Joey	 What the hell!'
Monica	 Okay.'
The Acting Teacher	 All right, let\xc2\x92s start with some basics. Can anybody\ntell me what the difference between upstage and downstage is?'
Joey	 Yeah, this was a stupid idea. (Exits.)'
