Joey	 (Voice Over) Previously on Friends.'
Ross	 I mean, I don\xc2\x92t feel like I even have a girlfriend anymore.'
Rachel	 You want me to just quit my job so that you can feel like you\xc2\x92ve\ngot a girlfriend?'
Ross	 Is this about Mark?'
Rachel	 (shocked) Oh my God.'
Ross	 Okay, it\xc2\x92s not, it\xc2\x92s not.'
Rachel	 Oh my God. I cannot keep having this same fight with you Ross! Look,\nurrgh, maybe we should take a break.'
Ross	 Fine, you\xc2\x92re right. Let\xc2\x92s ah, let\xc2\x92s take a break, (goes to\nthe door) let\xc2\x92s cool off, okay, let\xc2\x92s get some frozen yoghurt, or something..\n(opens the door)'
Rachel	 No. A break from us.'
Rachel	 Then, we had this big, stupid fight, and I said I wanted to take a\nbreak, I don\xc2\x92t want to take a break.'
Ross	 (on the phone) I\xc2\x92ve been thinking, this is crazy, I mean don\xc2\x92t,\ndon\xc2\x92t you think we can work on this? '
Mark	 Hey, what do you want to drink?'
Ross	 Who\xc2\x92s that?'
Rachel	 Nobody.'
Ross	 Is that Mark?'
Rachel	 Umm, honey, look he just came over to....'
Ross	 Yeah! Got it! (slams down the phone)'
Chloe	 Hey, come dance. What? Are you married? \xc2\x91Cause that\xc2\x92s okay.'

Monica	 Hey.'
Rachel	 Hey.'
Monica	 How\xc2\x92s the big anniversary dinner?'
Rachel	 Well, we never actually got to dinner.'
Monica	 Ohhh, nice.'
Rachel	 No, we kinda broke up instead.'
Monica	 What?! (She accidentally starts the blender without the lid on it and\nfruit flies everywhere.)'
Rachel	 (looking up at the ceiling) God, Monica it\xc2\x92s on the ceiling.'
Monica	 That\xc2\x92s okay, this is more important than fruit (pause) (angrily) on\nmy ceiling! You broke up?!'
Rachel	 Yeah, but it\xc2\x92s okay, because when Ross left Mark came over.'
Monica	 Oh no!! '
Rachel	 No.'
Monica	 Rachel, you and Mark?!'
Rachel	 No, no-no, it\xc2\x92s okay, calm down. Mark and I talked, and I realised\nhow much I love your stupid brother, and, yeah, we got our problems, but I really want to\nmake it work.'
Chloe	 (entering from bathroom) Morning!'

Rachel	 (on answering machine) Hi, it\xc2\x92s me. I\xc2\x92ve been trying to reach\nyou all night. I feel awful. Please, Ross, you gotta know there is nothing between me and\nMark. This whole break-up thing is just stupid. '
Ross	 Yeah!!'
Rachel	 Eh, I\xc2\x92m just so sorry I put you through it. And, I y'know, I\ndon\xc2\x92t want to get back together over a machine."
Ross	 Na-huh.'
Rachel	 So, I love you.'
Ross	 I love you.'
Rachel	 And y'know what, I\xc2\x92m gonna, I\xc2\x92m gonna go to bed now, but ah,\non my way to work tomorrow morning, I\xc2\x92m gonna stop by around 8
Ross	 Okay. (Ross starts frantically looking for a clock.)'
Rachel	 Bye.'
Ross	 Chloe, Chloe how\xc2\x92s it coming?!!'
Chloe	 (entering from bedroom) Hey, what kind of puppy do you think I should\nget?'
Ross	 Umm, oh, hey, I don\xc2\x92t know. How about a big one?'
Chloe	 But my apartment is so...'
Ross	 Well then a small one!! Listen, let\xc2\x92s, we kinda have to get going!'
Chloe	 Wait! Where\xc2\x92s my shoes?'
Ross	 You, you sure you need shoes? (Chloe nods her head) Okay. (reaches down\nand picks up a shoe)'
Chloe	 Do I know why we\xc2\x92re rushing?'
Ross	 Yeah, y'know the ah, the girlfriend I told you about last night?\n(He\xc2\x92s frantically throwing the cushions off of the couch looking for her other shoe)\nWell it turns out she ah, she wants to get back together with me. Oh, I found it!! "
Chloe	 That\xc2\x92s so great for you guys!'
Ross	 Yeah! '
Chloe	 You must be so happy!'
Ross	 Yes, yes I am, one of the many things I\xc2\x92m feeling. Well.... (picks up\nher coat)'
Chloe	 Good luck, with your girlfriend. '
Ross	 Oh, thank you. (She goes to kiss him, but he holds her coat up between\ntheir faces to stop her.) Hey, hey. (opens the door, sees Rachel, and hides Chloe behind\nthe door) Rachel!!!!'
Rachel	 Hi. Ohhh, you got my message.'
Ross	 Yeah, oh hey, you are right on time.'
Rachel	 So what do you say? Can I be your girlfriend again?'
Ross	 Yes, you can, very much.'
Ross	 (seeing the thumbs up) Ahhhh!! (Hugs Rachel tighter.)'
Phoebe	 Hey!'
Monica	 Hey.'
Phoebe	 Hey, why are you mopping your ceiling?'
Monica	 Oh, there\xc2\x92s banana on it.'
Phoebe	 Wow, I have the spirit of an old Indian women living in mine.'
Monica	 So then you know? (Phoebe nods her head)'
Phoebe	 The mailman was downstairs, so I brought up your mail.'
Monica	 Oh, good. Thanks.'
Phoebe	 Now what is Fabutec?'
Monica	 Okay, all right don\xc2\x92t judge me to much. Okay? Um, but I saw this\ninfo-mercial, and um, I swear to you I have never-ever bought anything on TV before,\nexcept for this mop. But there was this stuff on leg waxing, it just, it looked so\namazing....'
Phoebe	 Waxine!!'
Monica	 Yes! Have you seen it?'
Phoebe	 Oh, it\xc2\x92s incredible! I so want to be a Waxine girl.'
Monica	 I know!!'
Phoebe	 God. Do think it really doesn\xc2\x92t hurt? \xc2\x91Cause how can they do\nthat?'
Monica	 Hello! Organic substances recently discovered in the depths of the rain\nforest!'
Phoebe	 They have the best stuff in there.'
Chandler	 Oh my God! Oh my God!'
Joey	 Yeah. We figured when we couldn\xc2\x92t find you, you\xc2\x92d gone home to\nmake up with Rachel. Which is probably what you shoulda done. Huh?'
Ross	 You think?! God, I, ah, I\xc2\x92m in hell. I mean what, what am I gonna do?\nRachel\xc2\x92s all like, \xc2\x91I love you and, and let\xc2\x92s work on this.\xc2\x92 And all I\ncan think about is, \xc2\x91What is she gonna do? What is she gonna say?\xc2\x92 when I tell\nher what I did.'
Chandler	 Well, before we answer that, I think we should address the more\nimportant question. How dumb are you?'
Ross	 What?! Look, we\xc2\x92re trying to rebuild a relationship here, right. How\nam I supposed to do that here, without being totally honest with each other?'
Joey	 Look, Ross look, I\xc2\x92m on board about this totally honesty thing, I am,\njust not about stuff that\xc2\x92s gonna get you in trouble.'
Chandler	 He\xc2\x92s right. Nobody\xc2\x92s gonna benefit, and you\xc2\x92re just\ngonna hurt her.'
Joey	 Yeah, and there won\xc2\x92t be a relationship left to rebuild.'
Ross	 Yeah, but don\xc2\x92t you think....'
Chandler	 All right look, if you absolutely have to tell her, at least wait\nuntil the timing\xc2\x92s right. And that\xc2\x92s what deathbeds are for.'
Ross	 Yeah, okay. (he plops down into one of the leather chairs, with the\nfootrest extended.)'
Joey	 All right, okay, now, we just have to make sure she doesn\xc2\x92t find out\nsome other way. (spins the chair around so that Ross is facing him) Did you think about\nthe trail?'
Ross	 What trail?'
Joey	 (stomps on the footrest which pops Ross up into a sitting position) The\ntrail from the woman you did it with to the woman you hope never finds out who did it!\n(slapping his hands with each word) You always have to think about the trail!'
Ross	 Oh, I-I don\xc2\x92t think there\xc2\x92s any trail.'
Chandler	 Okay, okay-okay, ah, Chloe works with that guy Issac. Issac\xc2\x92s\nsister is Jasmine. And Jasmine works at that message place with Phoebe. And Phoebe\xc2\x92s\nfriends with Rachel. And that\xc2\x92s the trail, I did it!'
Phoebe	 (reading from the instructions) After applying the Waxine and linen\nstrips to leg number one, '
Monica	 Did that!'
Phoebe	 Grasp one of the linen strips by its \xc2\x91easy grab tab\xc2\x92 and pull\nit off in one quick pain free motion.'
Monica	 Okay. (Does so.) Ow!!!!! Ow-oh-oh!'
Phoebe	 Was it not pain-free?'
Monica	 No. It was painful. Oh my God , they should call it Pain-zine, now with\na little wax.'
Phoebe	 Huh, well, the girls in the satin nighties on the commercial don\xc2\x92t\nseem to think it\xc2\x92s that bad.'
Monica	 That\xc2\x92s because their nerves are probably deadened from being so\nstupid. But hey, y'know if you don\xc2\x92t believe me, please, by my guest."
Phoebe	 (Removing one of the strips) Ow-ow-ow-ow! Oh my God!!!'
Monica	 Now, are you glad we didn\xc2\x92t start with the bikini strips?'
Ross	 (entering) Chloe? Hi.. '
Chloe	 Is this about me taking your watch?'
Ross	 You took my watch?'
Chloe	 I\xc2\x92m sorry, I do that.'
Ross	 Just you keep it, listen did you, did you tell anyone about us?'
Chloe	 Oh no. I feel it isn\xc2\x92t really anybody\xc2\x92s business, y'know."
Ross	 Exactly. So you didn\xc2\x92t, didn\xc2\x92t mention anything to Issac right?'
Chloe	 Oh, well I tell Issac everything.'
Ross	 You tell, of course you do. Issac. Issac. Hey, Issac. Issac, hi! Y'know we\nhaven\xc2\x92t actually met..."
Issac	 You dog!'
Ross	 Yes, I suppose I am a dog. But Issac, see I-I happen to have a girlfriend.'
Issac	 Oh right, that Rachel chick from the coffee place.'
Ross	 Yeah, that\xc2\x92s the one. Listen, I don\xc2\x92t want to hurt her.'
Issac	 Oh, hey, man I know, doesn\xc2\x92t matter how much we love \xc2\x91em,\nmonogamy is too cruel a rule.'
Ross	 Yeah. Listen, can you keep this information to yourself?'
Issac	 Aw, no problem dude. Y'know we got to look out for each other. We\xc2\x92re\nthe same, you and me."
Ross	 Actually, no, we\xc2\x92re not.'
Issac	 Yeah, we are.'
Ross	 No, we\xc2\x92re not.'
Issac	 Yeah, we are.'
Ross	 No, we\xc2\x92re not!!'
Issac	 Okay, we\xc2\x92re not.'
Ross	 Right.'
Issac	 But, we are.'
Ross	 Fine. I just need to know that you\xc2\x92re not gonna tell your sister.'
Issac	 I can promise not to tell her again.'
Ross	 (entering out of breath) Jasmine? '
Jasmine	 Uh-huh.'
Ross	 We met at Phoebe\xc2\x92s birthday party, I\xc2\x92m, I\xc2\x92m Ross Geller.'
Jasmine	 You did a bad thing!'
Ross	 Yes, I did.'
Jasmine	 Very bad!'
Ross	 Very bad.'
Jasmine	 Very, very bad.'
Ross	 I\xc2\x92m agreeing with you. Did you, listen, did you happen to tell Phoebe\nyet?'
Jasmine	 No.'
Ross	 Okay, Jasmine, please, please don\xc2\x92t. I love my girlfriend very much,\nand I want more than anything to just work it out with her. Okay?'
Jasmine	 All right.'
Ross	 Thank you, thank you.'
Jasmine	 But you should probably talk to my roommate, because I told him and he\nknows Phoebe too.'
Ross	 (angrily) Who\xc2\x92s your roommate?'
Ross	 Gunther! Gunther. Gunther, please tell me you didn\xc2\x92t say anything to\nRachel about me and the girl from the Xerox place.'
Gunther	 I\xc2\x92m sorry. Was I not supposed to?'

Monica	 Ow!'
Phoebe	 Oh!!'
Monica	 Ow!! Ow!!'
Phoebe	 Ow!!!'
Monica and Phoebe	 Ow!!!!!!! Ow-ow-ow-ow!'
Phoebe	 We\xc2\x92re all right.'
Monica	 It\xc2\x92s okay, it\xc2\x92s okay.'
Phoebe	 We\xc2\x92re all right.'
Monica	 We were just waxing our legs.'
Chandler	 Off?!!'
Phoebe	 For your information, this happens to be a pain like no man will ever\nexperience.'
Chandler	 Yeah, well I don\xc2\x92t think you can make that statement, unless\nyou\xc2\x92ve been kicked in an area that God only meant to be treated nicely.'
Joey	 Yeah, I-I think that women just have a lower threshold of pain than men,\nthat\xc2\x92s all. I mean, come on, it\xc2\x92s just a little wax.'
Phoebe	 Oh yeah, come here. (Puts a little wax on Joey\xc2\x92s arm and puts a\nstrip on it.)'
Chandler	 Oh, that\xc2\x92s mature.'
Joey	 Okay, fine, so now what, I just pull it off?'
Phoebe	 Uh-huh.'
Monica	 That\xc2\x92s right.'
Ross	 (forcing the door open) Come on, Rachel, come on! Talk to me! Please!!'
Rachel	 I can\xc2\x92t talk to you. I can\xc2\x92t even look at you right now!'
Monica	 What?'
Chandler	 Nothing, nothing.'
Monica	 (going over to listen at the door) Rachel said everything was okay.'
Phoebe	 (to Joey) What, what are they talking about?'
Ross	 Rachel?'
Rachel	 Just get away from me!'
Ross	 No, it was a mistake! I made a mistake! Okay?'
Rachel	 A mistake?! What were you trying to put it in? Her purse?!'
Phoebe	 Whe-where did he put it?!'
Rachel	 Ross, you had sex with another woman!'
Monica	 Oh my God.'
Phoebe	 Oh, I knew something had to be wrong, because my fingernails did not\ngrow at all yesterday.'
Chandler	 Yeah, well, I guess they had a fight, and he got drunk....'
Monica	 Oh!! (hits Chandler and Joey in the head) You guys knew about this and\nyou didn\xc2\x92t tell us?!'
Chandler	 (to Joey) He has sex, and we get hit in our heads.'
Rachel	 (opening the door) Y'know what, I want you to leave! Get outta here! "
Ross	 No!!'
Rachel	 Just get out! Now!!'
Ross	 No!! No!! I wanna stay. I wanna talk about this.'
Rachel	 Okay! All right! How was she?'
Chandler	 Uh-oh.'
Ross	 What?'
Rachel	 Was she good?'
Joey	 Don\xc2\x92t answer that.'
Rachel	 Come on Ross! You said you wanted to talk about it, let\xc2\x92s talk\nabout it!! How was she?'
Ross	 She was...'
Joey	 Awful! Horrible!'
Chandler	 She was not good. Not good.'
Joey	 She was nothing compared to you.'
Ross	 She, she was different.'
Joey	 Ewwwww!'
Chandler	 Uh-oh.'
Rachel	 Good different?'
Ross	 Nobody likes change.'
Ross	 What? Okay, okay, okay, okay.'
Phoebe	 Should we do something?'
Chandler	 Yeah, never cheat on Rachel.'
Ross	 I\xc2\x92m sorry, okay, I\xc2\x92m sorry. I wa-I was disgusted with myself,\nand this morning I was so, I was so upset and then I got your message and I was so happy,\nand all I wanted was to get her out of my apartment as fast as possible.'
Rachel	 Whoa!! Whoa, whoa, wait a minute. What time did your little friend\nleave? (Ross can\xc2\x92t answer that) Oh my God. She was there? She was still there? She\nwas in there, when I was in there?!'
Ross	 Listen. Oh hey, hey, the important thing was that she meant, she meant\nnothing to me!'
Rachel	 And yet she was worth jeopardising our relationship!! '
Ross	 Look, I didn\xc2\x92t think there was a relationship to jeopardise. I\nthought we were broken up. '
Rachel	 We were on a break!'
Ross	 That, for all I knew would, could last forever. That to me is a break-up.'
Rachel	 You think you\xc2\x92re gonna get out of this on a technicality?'
Ross	 Look, I\xc2\x92m not trying to get out of anything, okay. I thought our\nrelationship was dead!'
Rachel	 Well, you sure had a hell of a time at the wake!'
Joey	 Y'know what, I don\xc2\x92t think we should listen to this anymore. (Goes to\nopen the door)"
Monica	 (stopping him) What, what are you doing? You can\xc2\x92t go out there.'
Joey	 Why not?! (to Chandler) I\xc2\x92m hungry.'
Monica	 Because they\xc2\x92ll know we\xc2\x92ve been listening.'
Rachel	 God! And to have to hear about it from Gunther!!'
Ross	 Come on! Like I wanted him to tell you, I ran all over the place trying to\nmake sure that didn\xc2\x92t happen!'
Rachel	 Oh, that is so sweet. I think I\xc2\x92m falling in love with you all over\nagain.'
Chandler	 Y'know what, I think we can go out there. I mean they have more\nimportant things to worry about."
Joey	 Yeah, we\xc2\x92ll be fine.'
Ross	 Look Rachel, I wanted to tell you, I thought I should, I-I did, and then\nChandler and Joey convinced me not to.'
Chandler	 (handing Monica the wax) Wax the door shut, we\xc2\x92re never leaving,\never.'
Phoebe	 Hi, it\xc2\x92s Phoebe. Listen someone\xc2\x92s gonna have to take my 9
Ross	 Don\xc2\x92t you realise none of this would\xc2\x92ve ever happened if I\ndidn\xc2\x92t think at that same moment you weren\xc2\x92t having sex with Mark?'
Rachel	 All right. Let\xc2\x92s say I had slept with Mark. Would you have been\nable to forgive me?'
Ross	 (pause) Yes I would.'
Rachel	 You\xc2\x92d be okay if you knew that Mark had kissed me, and been naked\nwith me, and made love to me?'
Ross	 (less sure) Yes.'
Rachel	 You knew that our hot, sweaty, writhing bodies were....'
Ross	 (covering his ears and screaming) La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la! Okay,\nokay, yeah, I would have been devastated but, I would still want to be with you. Because\nit\xc2\x92s, I mean it\xc2\x92s you.'
All	 Ohhhhh!'
Ross	 What? Come on Rach, tell me what you\xc2\x92re thinking?'
Rachel	 I\xc2\x92m thinking, I\xc2\x92m gonna order a pizza.'
Ross	 Order a pizza like, \xc2\x91I forgive you?\xc2\x92'
Joey	 Oh man, pizza? I like pizza. (makes like he is trying to send a telepathic\nmessage to Rachel) Put olives on the pizza.'
Phoebe	 We could eat the wax! It\xc2\x92s organic.'
Chandler	 Oh great, food with hair on it.'
Phoebe	 No, not the used wax.'
Chandler	 Because that would be crazy?'
Ross	 Hey, can I, can I get in on that? Because I\xc2\x92m kinda hungry myself.'
Rachel	 Fine. (on phone) Hi! Yes, I\xc2\x92d like to order a large pizza.'
Ross	 No anchovies.'
Rachel	 With ah, extra anchovies.'
Ross	 That\xc2\x92s okay, I\xc2\x92ll just pick \xc2\x91em off.'
Rachel	 Yeah, and could you please chop some up and just put it right there in\nthe sauce?'
Ross	 You can have the last piece, if you want.'
Rachel	 Well, I should think so. You slept with someone.'
Phoebe	 They\xc2\x92re gonna get through this, aren\xc2\x92t they?'
Chandler	 Yeah, come on, it\xc2\x92s Ross and Rachel, they\xc2\x92ve got too.'
Monica	 What if they don\xc2\x92t?'
Joey	 You think I need a new walk?'
Chandler	 What?'
Joey	 Well y'know, I\xc2\x92ve been walking the same way since high school.\nY'know, y'know how some guys they walk into a room and everybody takes notice. I think I\nneed a \xc2\x91take notice\xc2\x92 walk."
Chandler	 Are you actually saying these words?'
Ross	 What, now you\xc2\x92re not even taking to me? (moves over to the coffee\ntable) Look Rachel, I-I\xc2\x92m sorry, okay, I\xc2\x92m sorry, I was out of my mind. I\nthought I\xc2\x92d lost you, I didn\xc2\x92t know what to do. Come on! Come on, how insane\nmust I have been to do something like this? Huh? I-I don\xc2\x92t cheat right, I,\nthat\xc2\x92s not me, I\xc2\x92m not Joey!'
Joey	 Whoa-ho-ho! (He looks at Chandler, who gives him a \xc2\x91come on\xc2\x92\nlook.) Yeah, okay.'
Monica	 Hey. It\xc2\x92s three in the morning. They don\xc2\x92t know that I\xc2\x92ve\ncome home yet. You notice how neither one of them are wondering where I am.'
Phoebe	 Yeah, y'know, people can be so self-involved."
Ross	 Y'know what, y'know what, I\xc2\x92m-I\xc2\x92m not the one that wanted that,\nthat break, okay. You\xc2\x92re the one that bailed on us. You\xc2\x92re the one that, that\nran when things got just a little rough!"
Rachel	 That\xc2\x92s....'
Ross	 That\xc2\x92s what?!'
Rachel	 That is neither here nor there.'
Ross	 Okay, well here we are. Now we\xc2\x92re in a tough spot again, Rach. What\ndo you want to do? How do you want to handle it? Huh? Do you wanna fight for us? Or, do\nyou wanna bail? (sits down next to her) Look, I, (on the verge of tears) I did a terrible,\nstupid, stupid thing. Okay? And I\xc2\x92m sorry, I wish I could take it back, but I\ncan\xc2\x92t. (We see Monica and Phoebe are almost in tears.) I just can\xc2\x92t see us\nthrowing away something we know is so damn good. Rachel, I love you so much.'
Rachel	 No Ross!! (stands up and moves away from him) Don\xc2\x92t! You can\xc2\x92t\njust kiss me and think you\xc2\x92re gonna make it all go away, okay? It doesn\xc2\x92t work\nthat way. It doesn\xc2\x92t just make it better. Okay?'
Ross	 Okay, okay, okay.'
Rachel	 (softly) I think you should go.'
Ross	 What?'
Rachel	 (softly) I really think you need to go now.'
Ross	 (moving over to stand in front of her) Okay, okay. This morning you said\nthere was nothing so big that we couldn\xc2\x92t work past it together...'
Rachel	 Yeah, what the hell did I know!'
Ross	 Look, look, there\xc2\x92s got to be a way we can work past this. Okay,\n(takes a hold of one of her arms.) I can\xc2\x92t imagine, I can\xc2\x92t imagine my life\nwithout you. (Both of them are starting to cry.) Without, without these arms, and your\nface, and this heart. Your good heart Rach, (drops to his knees and hugs her around her\nwaist) and, and....'
Rachel	 (crying) No. I can\xc2\x92t, you\xc2\x92re a totally different person to me\nnow. I used to think of you as somebody that would never, ever hurt me, ever. God, and now\nI just can\xc2\x92t stop picturing with her, I can\xc2\x92t, (Ross stands up and backs away)\nit doesn\xc2\x92t matter what you say, or what you do, Ross. It\xc2\x92s just changed,\neverything. Forever.'
Ross	 (crying) Yeah, but this can\xc2\x92t be it, I mean.'
Rachel	 Then how come it is?'

Phoebe	 They\xc2\x92ve been quiet for a long time.'
Joey	 Maybe she killed him?'
Chandler	 Let\xc2\x92s go.'
Chandler	 (to Joey) Is that your new walk?'
Joey	 (whispering) No, I really have to pee.'
