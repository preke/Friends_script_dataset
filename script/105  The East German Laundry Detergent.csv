Monica	 Would you let it go? It's not that big a deal."
Ross	 Not that big a deal? It's amazing. Ok, you just reach in there, there's\none little maneuver, and bam, a bra right out the sleeve. All right, as far as I'm\nconcerned, there is nothing a guy can do that even comes close. Am I right?"
Rachel	 Come on! You guys can pee standing up.'
Chandler	 We can? All right, I'm tryin' that."
Joey	 Ok, you know what blows my mind? Women can see breasts any time they want.\nYou just look down and there they are. How you get any work done is beyond me.'
Phoebe	 Oh, ok, you know what I don't get? The way guys can do so many mean\nthings, and then not even care."
Ross	 Multiple orgasms!'
Chandler	 So, Saturday night, the big night, date night, Saturday night,\nSat-ur-day night!'
Joey	 No plans, huh?'
Chandler	 Not a one.'
Ross	 Not even, say, breaking up with Janice?'
Chandler	 Oh, right, right, shut up.'
Monica	 Chandler, nobody likes breaking up with someone. You just gotta do it.'
Chandler	 No, I know, but it's just so hard, you know? I mean, you're sitting\nthere with her, she has no idea what's happening, and then you finally get up the courage\nto do it, and there's the horrible awkward moment when you've handed her the note."
Joey	 Why do you have to break up with her? Be a man, just stop calling. '
Phoebe	 You know, if you want, I'll do it with you."
Chandler	 Oh, thanks, but I think she'd feel like we're gangin' up on her. "
Phoebe	 No, I mean you break up with Janice and I'll break up with Tony. "
Ross	 Tony?'
Monica	 Oh, you're breaking up with Tony?"
Phoebe	 Yeah, I know, he's sweet, but it's just not fun anymore, you know? I\ndon't know if it's me, or his hunger strike, or, I don't know."
Rachel	 (waitressing) Does anybody want anything else?'
Ross	 Oh, yeah, last week you had a wonderful, nutty, chocolatey kind of a cakey\npie thing. (Rachel gives him a dirty look) Nothing, just, just, I'm fine."
Phoebe	 (to Rachel) What's the matter? Why so scrunchy?"
Rachel	 It's my father. He wants to give me a Mercedes convertible."
Ross	 That guy, he burns me up.'
Rachel	 Yeah, well, it's a Mercedes if I move back home. Oh, it was horrible. He\ncalled me young lady."
Chandler	 Ooh, I hate when my father calls me that.'
Monica	 Did he give you that whole "You\'re-not-up-to-this" thing\nagain?'
Rachel	 Oh, yeah, yeah. Actually, I got the extended disco version, with three\nchoruses of "You\'ll never make it on your own".'
Phoebe	 (rhythmically) Uh-huh, uh-huh.'
Angela	 Hi, Joey.'
Joey	 My god, Angela.'
Monica	 Wow, being dumped by you obviously agrees with her.'
Phoebe	 Are you gonna go over there?'
Joey	 No, yeah, no, ok, but not yet. I don't wanna seem too eager. One\nMississippi, two Mississippi, three Mississippi. That seems pretty cool. (he walks over to\nher) Hey, Angela. "
Angela	 (casually) Joey.'
Joey	 You look good.'
Angela	 That's because I'm wearing a dress that accents my boobs."
Joey	 You don't say."
Ross	 So, uh, Rachel, what are you, uh, what're you doing tonight?"
Rachel	 Oh, big glamour night. Me and Monica at Laundorama.'
Ross	 Oh, you uh, you wanna hear a freaky coincidence? Guess who's doing laundry\nthere too?"
Rachel	 Who?'
Ross	 Me. Was that not clear? Hey, why don't, um, why don't I just join you\nboth, here?"
Rachel	 Don't you have a laundry room in your building?"
Ross	 Yes, I do have a laundry room in my building, um, but there's a.... rat\nproblem. Apparently they're attracted to the dryer sheets, and they're goin' in fine, but\nthey're comin' out all.... fluffy. Anyway, say, sevenish?"
Rachel	 Sure.'
Angela	 Forget it Joey. I'm with Bob now."
Joey	 Bob? Who the hell's Bob?"
Angela	 Bob is great. He's smart, he's sophisticated, and he has a real job.\nYou, you go on three auditions a month and you call yourself an actor, but Bob..."
Joey	 Come on, we were great together. And not just at the fun stuff, but like,\ntalking too.'
Angela	 Yeah, well, sorry, Joe. You said let's just be friends, so guess what?"
Joey	 What?'
Angela	 We're just friends."
Joey	 Fine, fine, so, why don't the four of us go out and have dinner together\ntonight? You know, as friends?"
Angela	 What four of us?'
Joey	 You know, you and Bob, and me and my girlfriend, uh, uh, Monica.'
Joey	 Monica, I'm tellin' you, this guy is perfect for you."
Monica	 Forget it. Not after your cousin who could belch the alphabet.'
Joey	 Come on. This guy's great. His name's Bob. He's Angela's... brother. He's\nsmart, he's sophisticated, and he has a real job. Me, I go on three auditions a month and\ncall myself an actor, but Bob is..."
Monica	 (looking out window) Oh, god help us.'
Joey	 What?'
Monica	 Ugly Naked Guy's laying kitchen tile. Eww!"
Joey	 Eww! Look, I'm asking a favor here. If I do this for her brother, maybe\nAngela will come back to me."
Monica	 What's going on here? You go out with tons of girls."
Joey	 (proud) I know, but, I made a huge mistake. I never should have broken up\nwith her. Will you help me? Please?'
Ross	 (on phone) Ok, bye. (hangs up) Well, Monica's not coming, it's just gonna\nbe me and Rachel."
Chandler	 Oh. Well, hold on camper, are you sure you've thought this thing\nthrough?"
Ross	 It's laundry. The thinking through is minimal."
Chandler	 It's just you and Rachel, just the two of you? This is a date. You're\ngoing on a date."
Ross	 Nuh-uh.'
Chandler	 Yuh-huh.'
Ross	 So what're you saying here? I should shave again, pick up some wine, what?"
Chandler	 Well, you may wanna rethink the dirty underwear. This is basically the\nfirst time she's gonna see your underwear\xc2\x97you want it to be dirty?"
Ross	 (sheepish) No.'
Chandler	 Oh, and uh, the fabric softener?'
Ross	 Ok, ok, now what is wrong with my Snuggles? What, it says I'm a\nsensitive, warm kinda guy, you know, like a warm, fuzzy bear. Ok, I can pick something\nelse up on the way."
Chandler	 There you go.'
Monica	 Thank you. So what does this Bob guy look like? Is he tall? Short?'
Joey	 Yep.'
Monica	 Which?'
Joey	 Which what?'
Monica	 You've never met Bob, have you?"
Joey	 No, but he's..."
Monica	 Oh my god, Joey, for all we know this guy could be horribly...'
Angela	 Hey, Joey.'
Monica	 ...horribly attractive. I'll be shutting up now."
Chandler	 Where are they? Where are they?'
Phoebe	 This is nice. We never do anything just the two of us.'
Chandler	 It's great. Maybe tomorrow we can rent a car and run over some\npuppies."
Phoebe	 Eww, I don't wanna do that."
Chandler	 Here we go.'
Phoebe	 Ok, have a good break-up.'
Chandler	 Hey, Janice.'
Janice	 Oh, my god, I am so glad you called me. I had the most supremely awful\nday.'
Chandler	 Hey, that's not good. Can I get an espresso and a latte over here,\nplease?"
Janice	 We got the proofs back from that photo shoot, you know, the one with the\nlittle vegetables. Anyway, they pretty much sucked, so, I blew off the rest of the day,\nand I went shopping...(looks through her bags)... and I got you, I'm looking, I'm looking,\nI'm looking, I got you..."
Chandler	 What?'
Janice	 What?'
Chandler	 (covering) What... did you get me there? '
Janice	 I got you...these. (pulls out a pair of socks)'
Chandler	 Bullwinkle socks. That's so sweet."
Janice	 Well, I knew you had the Rockys, and so I figured, you know, you can\nwear Bullwinkle and Bullwinkle, or you can wear Rocky and Rocky,or, you can mix and match,\nmoose and squirrel. Whatever you want.'
Chandler	 That's great. "
Chandler	 Well, I'm gonna get another espresso. Can I get you another latte?"
Janice	 (holding the full cup) No, no, I'm still working on mine."
Chandler	 That's it?"
Phoebe	 Yeah, it was really hard.'
Chandler	 Oh, yeah, that hug looked pretty brutal.'
Phoebe	 Ok, you weren't there."
Woman	 Comin' through. Move, move."
Rachel	 Oh, 'scuse me. I was kinda using that machine."
Woman	 Yeah, well, now you're kinda not."
Rachel	 But I saved it. I put my basket on top.'
Woman	 Oh, I'm sorry, is that your basket? It's really pretty. Unfortunately, I\ndon't see suds."
Rachel	 What?'
Woman	 No suds, no save. Ok?'
Ross	 What's goin' on?"
Rachel	 Hi, uh, nothing. That horrible woman just took my machine.'
Ross	 Was your basket on top?'
Rachel	 Yeah, but, there were no suds.'
Ross	 So?'
Rachel	 Well, you know, no suds, no save.'
Ross	 No suds? Excuse me, hold on a second. (to woman) That's my friend's\nmachine."
Woman	 Hey, hey, hey, her stuff wasn't in it."
Ross	 Hey, hey, hey, that's not the rule and you know it. "
Ross	 (to the crowd in the laundromat) All right, show's over. Nothing to see\nhere. (to Rachel) Ok, let's do laundry."
Rachel	 That was amazing. I can't even send back soup."
Ross	 Well, that's because you're such a sweet, gentle, uh...Do you, uh, do\nyou...Oh, hey, uh you must need detergent."
Rachel	 What's that?"
Ross	 Uberveiss. It's new, it's German, it's extra-tough."
Ross	 Rach, do you uh, are you gonna separate those?'
Rachel	 Oh god. Oh, am I being like a total laundry spaz? I mean, am I supposed\nto use like one machine for shirts and another machine for pants? '
Ross	 Rach, have you never done this before?'
Rachel	 Well, not myself, but I know other people that have. Ok, you caught me.\nI'm a laundry virgin."
Ross	 Uh, well, don't worry, I'll use the gentle cycle. Ok, um, basically you\nwanna use one machine for all your whites, a whole nother machine for colors, and a third\nfor your uh, your uh, delicates, and that would be your bras and your under-panty things."
Rachel	 (holds a pair of panties in front of Ross) Ok, Well, what about these\nare white cotton panties. Would they go with whites or delicates?'
Ross	 (visibly nervous) Uh, that, that, that would be a judgment call.'
Monica	 (to Joey) He is so cute. (to Angela and Bob) So, where did you guys grow\nup?'
Angela	 Brooklyn Heights.'
Bob	 Cleveland.'
Monica	 How, how did that happen?'
Joey	 Oh my god.'
Monica	 What?'
Joey	 I suddenly had the feeling that I was falling. But I'm not."
Joey	 So, you and Angela, huh?'
Bob	 Yep. Pretty much.'
Joey	 You're a lucky man. You know what I miss the most about her? That cute\nnibbly noise when she eats. Like a happy little squirrel, or a weasel."
Bob	 Huh, I never really noticed.'
Joey	 Oh, yeah, yeah, listen for it.'
Bob	 Monica, Monica is great.'
Joey	 Yeah, but it's not gonna last. She's too much for me in bed. Sexually."
Monica	 I've gotta tell you, Bob is terrific."
Angela	 Yeah, isn't he?"
Monica	 It is so great to meet a guy who is smart and funny, and has an\nemotional age beyond, like eight.'
Angela	 You know what else? He's unbelievable in bed."
Monica	 Wow. My brother never even told me when he lost his virginity.'
Angela	 Huh. That's nice."
Phoebe	 Ok, you can do this. It's just like pulling off a Band-aid. Just do it\nreally fast, and then the wound is exposed."
Chandler	 Janice. Hi, Janice. Ok, here we go. I don't think we should go out\nanymore. Janice."
Janice	 All right. Well, there you go. (she gets extremely wound up, and begins\nto try and calm herself down) Stop it, stop it, stop it.'
Rachel	 Ok, I know this is gonna sound really stupid, but I feel that if I can\ndo this, you know, if I can actually do my own laundry, there isn't anything I can't do."
Ross	 That does not sound stupid to me. You know, it's like the first time I had\nto make dinner for myself, after Carol left me? (the buzzer on the washer goes off) I'm\nsorry, that's all the time we have. Next on Ross...(opens up the washer) Uh-oh."
Rachel	 What uh-oh?'
Ross	 (not wanting to tell her) Uh-oh, uh-oh, the laundry's done. It's, uh, it's\na song. The laundry song that we sing. (singing) Uh-oh the laundry's done, uh-oh, uh-oh."
Rachel	 Ross, what's the matter?"
Ross	 Nothing, nothing. Lee-lo, the laundry's done."
Rachel	 Come on, show me.'
Ross	 All right, all right, it's just that you left a red sock in with all your\nwhites, and now, everything's kinda pink."
Rachel	 Oh, everything's pink."
Ross	 Yeah, uh, except for the red sock, which is still red. I'm sorry, please\ndon't be upset, it could happen to anyone."
Rachel	 Except it didn't. It happened to me. Oh, god, I'm gonna look like a big\nmarshmallow peep. What am I doing? What am I doing? My father's right. I can't live on my\nown! I can't even do laundry!"
Monica	 Something went wrong with Underdog, and they couldn't get his head to\ninflate. So anyway, um, his head is like flopping down Broadway, right, and I'm just\nthinking... how inappropriate this is. Um, I've got something in my eye, uh, Joey, could\nwe check it in the light, please? "
Monica	 Oh my god.'
Joey	 What?'
Monica	 Hello! Were we at the same table? It's like... cocktails in Appalachia."
Joey	 Come on, they're close."
Monica	 Close? She's got her tongue in his ear."
Joey	 Oh, like you've never gotten a little rambunctious with Ross."
Monica	 Joey, this is sick, it's disgusting, it's, it's\xc2\x97not really true, is\nit?"
Joey	 Well, who's to say what's true? I mean..."
Monica	 Oh my god, what were you thinking?'
Joey	 All right, look, I'm not proud of this, ok? Well, maybe I am a little."
Monica	 (hits him lightly) Oh! '
Joey	 Ow!'
Monica	 (leaving) I'm outta here."
Joey	 Wait, wait, wait. You want him, I want her. He likes you.'
Monica	 Really?'
Joey	 Yeah. I'm thinking, if we put our heads together, between the two of us,\nwe can break them up."
Monica	 I'm so sorry, I can't believe I did this, but I couldn't stop laughing\nat your Norman Mailer story."
Joey	 Uh, waiter, one more plate of chicken wings over here.'
Chandler	 Here's the thing, Janice. You know, I mean, it's like we're different.\nI'm like the bing, bing, bing. You're like the boom, boom, (Chandler flails his hand out\nand hits Janice in the eye)... boom."
Janice	 Ow!'
Chandler	 Oh, my god, I'm so sorry. Are you ok?"
Janice	 Ow. Um, it's just my lens. It's just my lens. I'll be right back."
Chandler	 (to Phoebe) I hit her in the eye! I hit her in the eye! This is the\nworst break-up in the history of the world. '
Phoebe	 Oh my god. (Chandler downs another espresso.) How many of those have you\nhad?'
Chandler	 Oh, I don't know, a million?"
Phoebe	 Chandler, easy, easy. Go to your happy place. La la la la la la la.'
Chandler	 I'm fine."
Phoebe	 All right. '
Chandler	 I'm not fine. Here she comes."
Phoebe	 Wait here. Breathe.'
Chandler	 How do you do that?'
Phoebe	 It's like a gift."
Chandler	 We should always always break up together.'
Phoebe	 Oh, I'd like that."
Ross	 You got the clothes clean. Now that's the important part."
Rachel	 Oh, I guess. Except everything looks like jammies now.'
Rachel	 Whoa, I'm sorry. Excuse me. We had this cart."
Woman	 Yeah, well, I had a 24-inch waist. You lose things. Now come on, get\noutta my way.'
Rachel	 I'm sorry, you know, maybe I wasn't being clear. Uh, this is our cart."
Woman	 Hey, hey, hey there aren't any clothes in it."
Rachel	 Hey, hey, hey, hey, quit making up rules!'
Woman	 Let go!'
Rachel	 All right, listen, missy. If you want this cart, you're gonna have to\ntake me with it! "
Rachel	 (to Ross) Yes! Did you see that?'
Ross	 You were incredible! Brand new woman, ladies and gentlemen.'
Rachel	 I could not have done this without you.'
Ross	 Ok, um, uh, more clothes in the dryer? (Ross turns and bangs his head on\nan open dryer door.) I'm fine, I'm fine."
Rachel	 Are you sure?'
Ross	 No.'

Rachel	 Oh, are you sure you're ok?"
Ross	 Yeah.'
Rachel	 Does it still hurt?'
Ross	 Yeah.'
Phoebe	 (seeing Rachel's clothes) What a neat idea. All your clothes match. I'm\ngonna do this."
Monica	 Hi.'
Phoebe	 Hey, how'd it go?"
Joey	 Excellent.'
Monica	 We ripped that couple apart, and kept the pieces for ourselves.'
Ross	 What a beautiful story. Hey, I'm fine by the way."
Monica	 (notices his head) Oh, I'm sorry."
Rachel	 Where's Chandler?"
Phoebe	 Oh, he needed some time to grieve.'
Chandler	 I'm free! I'm free!"
Phoebe	 That oughta do it.'
