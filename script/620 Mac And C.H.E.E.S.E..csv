Joey	 Y\xc2\x92know what? I think that\xc2\x92s enough for now. Yeah. I don\xc2\x92t\nwant to be over rehearsed.'
Phoebe	 (tremendously overacting) Fine! I\xc2\x92ll do it without you! (Joey gives\nher thumbs up) I don\xc2\x92t need you or anybody else! I\xc2\x92m gonna make it on my own!\n(Joey closes the door to his bedroom.) You\xc2\x92ll see!! You\xc2\x92ll all see!! '

Chandler	 (To Joey) So uh, what\xc2\x92s this thing you\xc2\x92re auditioning for?'
Joey	 Oh, it\xc2\x92s a new TV show. Yeah. I\xc2\x92m up for the part of Mac\nMacaveli or "Mac." Yeah, I\xc2\x92m a detective and I solve crimes with the help\nof my robot partner. He\xc2\x92s a, he\xc2\x92s a Computerized Humanoid Electronically\nEnhanced Secret Enforcer or-or "C.H.E.E.S.E."'

Chandler	 Now-now, why would you say that Joseph?'
Joey	 I mean come on you guys! My own TV show? I just don\xc2\x92t know if\nI\xc2\x92m good enough.'
Phoebe	 I am.'
Rachel	 Joey, what are you talking about? You\xc2\x92re a terrific actor.'
Joey	 You really think so?'
Rachel	 Ugh, how can you even ask that question?!'
Chandler	\xc2\xa0 Whoa, she's pretty. (Mentioning the girl on TV)"
Joey	\xc2\xa0 Yeah, and oh she's really nice too. She taught me all about how to\nwork the cameras, and smell-the-fart acting."
Rachel	\xc2\xa0 I'm sorry, what?"
Monica	\xc2\xa0 What?'
Ross	\xc2\xa0 Excuse me?'
Joey	\xc2\xa0 It's like, you got so many lines to learn so fast, that sometimes\nyou need a minute to remember your next one. So while you're thinkin' of it, you take this\nbig pause where you look all intense, you know, like this. (Does this intense look where\nit looks like he's smelling a fart.)"
Chandler	\xc2\xa0 Oh, ok.'
Joey	 (there\'s a gunshot on TV) There\'s my scene, there\'s my scene. [Joey on\ntv] "Mrs. Wallace, I\'m Dr. Drake Ramoray, your sister\'s neurosurgeon.\xc2\xa0 I\'m\nafraid the situation is much worse than we expected. Your sister is suffering from\na..." (Does the smell-the-fart look.)'
Joey	 (on stage in an Austrian accent) Vell, Eva, ve've done some excellent vork\nhere, and I vould have to say, your pwoblem is qviiite clear. (He goes into a song and\ndance number.) "
Joey	\xc2\xa0 I play Al Pacino's butt. All right? He goes into the shower, and\nthen- I'm his butt.\n\nMonica
Monica	\xc2\xa0 Yes.'
Ross	\xc2\xa0 So you gonna invite us all to the big opening?'
Joey	 All right well, I\xc2\x92m outta here. Wish me luck.'
Phoebe	 (overacting with a song this time) (singing) Gooood luck! Gooood\nluck! We all wish you good luuuuuuuuck!!!'
Joey	 Yeah, whatever. (Exits.)'
Ross	 It\xc2\x92s your turn.'
Chandler	 Oh, are we playing this?!'
Joey	 (entering, dejectedly) Hey.'
Chandler	 Hey! How\xc2\x92d the audition go?'
Joey	 Terrible! I messed up every line! I shouldn\xc2\x92t even be\nan actor!'
Ross	 Wait a minute, are you doing that thing where you pretend it didn\xc2\x92t\ngo well but it really did go well?'
Joey	 Yeah, did I fool ya?'
Ross	 Totally!'
Chandler	 So it did go well.'
Joey	 Oh, it went amazingly well!'
Ross	 Great!'
Chandler	 Oh that\xc2\x92s great!'
Joey	 Yeah-yeah, it\xc2\x92s down to me and two other guys.'
Chandler	 Oh my God!'
Ross	 Wow!'
Joey	 And I know both of them, they\xc2\x92re really good. One of them is the guy\nfrom those allergy commercials who\xc2\x92s always getting chased by those big flowers\xc2\x85'
Ross	 Oh, I love that guy! (Laughs.)'
Chandler	 Oh-oh, what are you doing?'
Ross	 (stops laughing) What am I doing?'
Joey	 I\xc2\x92m just so nervous! Y\xc2\x92know? The callback isn\xc2\x92t until\ntomorrow at five. I feel like my head is going to explode!'
Chandler	 Well, it is overdue.'
Ross	 Look, don\xc2\x92t worry. Okay? You\xc2\x92re gonna be fine.'
Joey	 There\xc2\x92s just so much pressure. I mean no offense, but what you guys\ndo is very different. I don\xc2\x92t know if you\xc2\x92d understand.'
Ross	 Yeah, none of us have to deal with pressure at our jobs.'
Chandler	 (on phone) Yes, Fran. I know what time it is, but I'm looking at the\nWENUS and I'm not happy!"
Monica	\xc2\xa0 Alright, well I'm tearing the lettuce."
Interviewer	\xc2\xa0 Uh-huh. Is it dirty?'
Monica	\xc2\xa0 Oh-oh, no no don't worry, I'm gonna wash it."
Interviewer	\xc2\xa0 Don't, I like it dirty."
Monica	\xc2\xa0 That's your call."
Interviewer	\xc2\xa0 So, uh, what are you going to do next?'
Monica	\xc2\xa0 Well, I thought that I would cut up the tomatos.'
Interviewer	\xc2\xa0 Are they, uh, firm?'
Monica	\xc2\xa0 They'r alright."
Interviewer	\xc2\xa0 You sure they haven't gone bad? You're sure they're not very,\nvery bad?"
Monica	\xc2\xa0 No really, they're OK."
Interviewer	\xc2\xa0 You gonna slice them up real nice?'
Monica	\xc2\xa0 Actually, I was gonna do them jullienne.'
Interviewer	\xc2\xa0 Aaaahhhhhhh.'
Monica	\xc2\xa0 I'm outa here. [Monica leaves]"
Rachel	\xc2\xa0 (on the phone) Monica, I\xc2\x92m quitting! I just helped an 81 year\nold woman put on a thong and she didn\xc2\x92t even buy it! (Pause) I\xc2\x92m telling you\nI\xc2\x92m quitting! That\xc2\x92s it! I\xc2\x92m talking to my boss right now! (Pause) Yes I\nam! (Pause) Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Okay bye, call me when you\nget this message. (Hangs up.)'
Monica	\xc2\xa0 Well, what happened?'
Phoebe	\xc2\xa0 Well, he came in for a massage and everything was fine until...\n(The flashback shows Paulo lying face down on the massage table and slowly moving his\nhands up Phoebe's legs and grabbing her butt.)"
All	\xc2\xa0 Ohhhhhh!'
Ross	\xc2\xa0 Oh my God!'
Phoebe	\xc2\xa0 And all of the sudden his hands weren't the problem anymore. (The\nflashback shows Paulo rolling over and showing Phoebe his equipment.)"
Monica	\xc2\xa0 Was it...'
Phoebe	\xc2\xa0 Oh, Boy Scouts could've camped under it!"
Ross	 You ate my sandwich?'
Dr. Leedbetter	 It was a simple mistake. It could happen to anyone.'
Ross	 (getting upset) Oh-oh really? '
Dr. Leedbetter	 Now-now calm down. Come look in my office, some of it my still\nbe in the trash.'
Ross	 (jumping to his feet in anger) What?'
Dr. Leedbetter	 Well, it was quite large. I-I-I-I-I had to throw most of it\naway.'
Ross	 You-you-you-you (trying to remain in control) threw my sandwich away!'
Ross	\xc2\xa0 (losing control, we hear him shout outside) MY SANDWICH?!!!'
Ross	 MY SANDWICH!!!!!! (Ross's scream scares a flight of pigeons away.)"
Joey	 I want this part so much! Y\xc2\x92know? If I don\xc2\x92t get this part\nI\xc2\x92m never gonna eat Macaroni and Cheese again!\xc2\x97No, I didn\xc2\x92t say\nthat! That\xc2\x92s a lie.'
Chandler	 Oh come on guys, it\xc2\x92s not like I moved to Europe! I just moved\nacross the hall! And we would have you over all the time if it weren\xc2\x92t for\n(struggles to get this out) Monica\xc2\x92s allergies. (The duck quacks.) You\xc2\x92re right,\nI could never lie to you. She hates you. (The phone rings.) Should I get that? (Laughs,\nthen answers the phone.) Hello? (Listens) Uh no, Joey\xc2\x92s not here right now. Can I\ntake a message? (Listens) Yeah, okay so the audition has been moved from 5
Monica	 (startled) Ahh! Aren\xc2\x92t you dressed yet?'
Chandler	 (looks down at his clothes) Am I naked again?!'
Monica	 We\xc2\x92re supposed to meet my parents in 15 minutes.'
Chandler	 Yeah okay, I was just talking to the guys. Just look at them I mean,\nis it okay if they come visit?'
Monica	 Wh?! What about my allergies?!'
Chandler	 Oh right, your allergies. (Monica leaves and to the chick and duck)\nAll her, she hates you. (Chandler leaves without finishing the message for Joey.)'
Joey	 Yes!! Ha-ha!! All right! Hey! How cool would it be if you could watch like\na real life-sized version of this? Huh? I mean how crazy would that be?'
Chandler	 As crazy as soccer?'
Joey	 (on phone) Hello? (Listens) What are you talking about? The\naudition\xc2\x92s not \xc2\x91til 5
Chandler	 You mean you didn\xc2\x92t get it from this?'
Joey	 The allergy guy got the part! Thanks!'
Chandler	 Well, maybe we can fix it y\xc2\x92know? Maybe we can send him some-some\nbig-big flowers and scare him!'
Joey	 How could you do this to me Chandler?! This part could\xc2\x92ve turned my\nwhole career around!'
Chandler	 I messed up. Okay? I\xc2\x92m sorry, I really messed up.'
Joey	 Hey, you don\xc2\x92t even live here anymore! What are you doing answering\nmy phone? I have my machine!'
Chandler	 Which I bought for ya. Taught ya how to use it. You thought it was a\ncopier. Look, if there was anything I could do, I would do it. Okay? But everybody\xc2\x92s\nallowed one mistake, right?'
Chandler	\xc2\xa0 You know he coulda gotten me a VCR, he coulda gotten me a set of\ngolf clubs, but no, he has to get me the woman repeller!\xc2\xa0 The eyesore from the\nLiberace house of crap!'
Phoebe	\xc2\xa0 It's not that bad."
Chandler	\xc2\xa0 Oh, yeah, easy for you to say, you don't have to walk around\nsporting some reject from the Mr. T collection. [Joey walks in behind Chandler]"
Phoebe	\xc2\xa0 Chandler, Chandler.'
Chandler	\xc2\xa0 I pity the fool who puts on my jewelry, I do, I do. I pity the\nfool that. . . [turns around and sees Joey] Hi!'
Chandler	\xc2\xa0 Yeah, I mean when you were late last night, Kathy and I got to\ntalking, and one thing to another and\xc2\x85'
Joey	\xc2\xa0 And what?! Did you sleep with her?!'
Chandler	\xc2\xa0 No! No! No! I just kissed her.'
Joey	\xc2\xa0 What?!! That\xc2\x92s even worse!!'
Chandler	\xc2\xa0 How is that worse?!'
Joey	\xc2\xa0 I don\xc2\x92t know! But it\xc2\x92s the same!'
Chandler	\xc2\xa0 You\xc2\x92re right, I have no excuses! I was totally over the\nline.'
Joey	\xc2\xa0 Over the line?! You-you\xc2\x92re-you\xc2\x92re so far past the line,\nthat you-you can\xc2\x92t even see the line! The line is a dot to you!'
Chandler	 Look, I\xc2\x92m not saying that you should magically forgive me! But\nyou\xc2\x92re not perfect! You\xc2\x92ve made some errors in judgment too!'
Joey	 Name one!'
Chandler	 (lets him out) What happened?!!'
Joey	 (getting out) Awww, man! He promised he wouldn\xc2\x92t take the chairs!!'
Chandler	\xc2\xa0 What the hell happened?!! How were you locked in?!! And where\nthe hell is all of our stuff?!!'
Joey	\xc2\xa0 Well, this guy came by to look at the unit and-and he said he\ndidn\xc2\x92t think big enough to fit a grown man!'
Chandler	\xc2\xa0 So--You got in voluntarily?!'
Joey	\xc2\xa0 I was tryin\xc2\x92 to make a sale!! Oh, man, if I ever run into that\nguy again, do you know what I\xc2\x92m gonna do?'
Chandler	\xc2\xa0 BEND OVER?!!!'
Chandler	 Ok, now, remember, no trading. You get the pretty one, I get the mess.'
Lorraine	 Hi, Joey. (Sees Chandler.) Well well, look what you brought.'
Chandler	 ...And what did you bring?'
Lorraine	 She's checking the coats. Joey, I'm gonna go wash the cab\nsmell off my hands. Will you get me a white Zinfandel, and a glass of red for Janice."
Chandler	 Janice?'
Chandler	 Janice?!'
Janice	 Oh.... my.... God.'
Chandler	 Joey's tailor...took advantage of me."
Ross	 What?'
Joey	 No way!\xc2\xa0 I've been going to the guy for 12 years."
Chandler	 Oh come on!\xc2\xa0 He said he was going to do my inseam, and he ran his\nhand up my leg, and then, there was definite...'
Ross	 What?'
Chandler	 Cupping.'
Joey	 That's how they do pants!\xc2\xa0 Ross, will you tell him? Isn't that how\nthey measure pants?"
Ross	 Yes, yes it is. In prison!'
Joey	 I said name one!'

Chandler	 I can\xc2\x92t believe I did this! What an idiot!'
Monica	 Oh, stop beating yourself up! People make mistakes! These things happen!\nThere aren\xc2\x92t any message you\xc2\x92ve forgotten to give me are there? (Chandler has a\ndisgusted look on his face.) Apparently you\xc2\x92re not very good at it! I\xc2\x85'
Chandler	 Do you think he\xc2\x92ll ever forgive me?'
Rachel	 Of course he will! But Chandler the most important thing is you forgive\nyourself!'
Chandler	 Y\xc2\x92know what? I-I kinda have.'
Rachel	 Already? That\xc2\x92s pretty bad what you did.'
Monica	 Y\xc2\x92know what? He will forgive you. And I like to bring a pad\nwith me when I go answer the phone just in case\xc2\x85 (Chandler gets that disgusted look\nback.) Okay\xc2\x85'
Chandler	 You didn\xc2\x92t see how mad he was, y\xc2\x92know?'
Rachel	 I\xc2\x92m sure he will forgive you. Look, we have all been there!\nY\xc2\x92know, you fight, you make up, it\xc2\x92s just the way it works.'
Ross	 It took two people to break up this relationship!!'
Rachel	 Yeah! You and that girl from that copy place, which yesterday you took\nfull responsibility for!!'
Ross	 I didn\xc2\x92t know what I was taking full responsibility for! Okay?! I\ndidn\xc2\x92t finish the whole letter!'
Rachel	 What?!!'
Ross	 I fell asleep!'
Rachel	 (mocking him) You fell asleep?!'

Ross	 (starts to cry) FINE BY ME!! (he opens the door and traps Chandler behind\nit)'
Rachel	 And hey! Just so you know, it\xc2\x92s not that common! It doesn\xc2\x92t\nhappen to every guy! And it is a big deal!!'
Chandler	 (coming out from behind the door) I KNEW IT!!!!'

Rachel	 That is the most ridiculous...'
Monica	 You sold me out.'
Rachel	 I did not sell you out.'
Monica	 Yes you did.\xc2\xa0 You absolutely sold me...'
Rachel	 Would you let me talk. [flicks Monica on the forehead]'
Monica	 Did you just flick me?'

Chandler	 Oh my God!\xc2\xa0 '
Joey	 Look at me! I'm Chandler! Could I be wearing any more clothes?\nMaybe if I wasn't going commando..."
Joey	 Yeah. Whew, it's hot with all of this stuff on. I ah, I better not do any,\nI don't know, lunges. (starts doing lunges)"
[Scene	 Joey and Rachel's apartment, Chandler is entering with a peace offering of a\nJoey Special, two pizzas.]"
Chandler	 Joey? Got you a Joey Special, two pizzas! Joe? (The phone rings\nand he answers it) (On phone) Hello? (Takes the phone away from his mouth when he realizes\nwhat he just did and yells.) Damnit! (Back on phone.) Hello? (Listens.) No, Joey\xc2\x92s\nnot here right now, but I can take a message I think. (Listens) He\xc2\x92s still got a\nchance for the part?! Oh, that\xc2\x92s great news! (Listens) Well no obviously not for the\nactor who was mauled by his dog. (Listens) Oh well, that\xc2\x92s great. I will give Joey\nthe message. Thank you! (Hangs up and goes to write the message on the Magna-Doodle.)\nYes! (Reading what he\xc2\x92s writing) Okay, Mac audition at 2
Joey	 Hey!'
Chandler	 Please tell me you got the message!'
Joey	 What message?'
Chandler	 The actor playing Mac couldn\xc2\x92t do it, they needed to see you at 2\no\xc2\x92clock.'
Joey	 What?! It\xc2\x92s 6 o\xc2\x92clock!'
Chandler	 Du-du-I wrote it, I wrote it on the board! I wrote it on the board,\nthen I went all over New York City looking for ya! I went to Ross\xc2\x92s! I went to the\ncoffeehouse! I went to any place that they made sandwiches!'
Joey	 I can\xc2\x92t believe this Chandler!'
Chandler	 Sorry! I-I-I don\xc2\x92t know what to say.'
Joey	 Well you-you-you-you might say congratulations! I saw the board! I went to\nthe audition! I got the part!!'
Chandler	 (angrily) Is that supposed to be funny! I was really worried over\nhere!'
Joey	 Oh, well I\xc2\x92m uh\xc2\x85'
Chandler	 Y\xc2\x92know, sometimes that fake out thing is just mean!'
Joey	 Oh wow! Okay man, I\xc2\x92m sorry. I did not mean to make you feel bad.'
Chandler	 Well that\xc2\x92s good. Because you didn\xc2\x92t! And I\xc2\x92m\nincredibly happy for ya!!'
Joey	 (shocked) That\xc2\x92s mean! You really had me going there!'
Chandler	 Oh, we could do this all day.'
Joey	 Yeah, you\xc2\x92re right. Okay look, listen, let\xc2\x92s talk about what a\nhuge star I\xc2\x92m gonna be!'
Chandler	 You are gonna be a huge star! I\xc2\x92m gonna hug ya!'
Joey	 You hug me!'
Chandler	 All right!'
Joey	 Hey, do we do this too much?'
Chandler	 I think so. Yeah, get off me.'
Joey	 Yeah.'

Joey	 Come on C.H.E.E.S.E., I\xc2\x92m not leaving without you! Try routing your\nbackup source through your primary CPU.'
Phoebe	 (overacting badly) I can\xc2\x92t! My circuits are fried! They\xc2\x92re\nfried I tell you!!'
Joey	 Wow! (Back to reading the scene.) Well then I\xc2\x92ll just have to carry\nyou.'
Ross	 That\xc2\x92ll be a neat trick, when you\xc2\x92re, (looks at the script) when\nyou\xc2\x92re dead!'
Joey	 Ross, you don\xc2\x92t have to yell.'
Ross	 There was just an explosion, okay? My hearing would be impaired. '
Phoebe	 I thought you were excellent! In fact for a minute there I was like,\n"Ooh, where\xc2\x92d Ross go?"'
Ross	 Thank you! And I have to say that first scene when you meet Mac\xc2\x85'
Phoebe	 Yeah?'
Ross	 Oh my God. I mean\xc2\x85'
Joey	 Y\xc2\x92know what? I think that\xc2\x92s enough for today. Thanks for your\nhelp! (He grabs their scripts and heads for his room.)'
Phoebe	 (To Ross) He\xc2\x92s holding us back.'
Ross	 Totally.'
