Chandler	 Okay, she is the star of the play. And she is my girlfriend! I\nget to have sex with the star of the play!'
Ross	 People can hear you.'
Chandler	 I know!!'
Chandler	 Wow! She looks great. Doesn\xc2\x92t she?'
Ross	 Yeah.'
Kathy's Co-Star	 Hi!"
Kathy	 Hi!'
Ross	 That is one good looking man!'
Chandler	 Is it just me, or can you actually see his abs through his overcoat?!'
Kathy's Co-Star	 Sooo, you\xc2\x92ve been doing this long?"
Kathy	 No, you\xc2\x92re my first. Put the money on the table.'
Kathy's Co-Star	 Oh, yeah! Ooh, that\xc2\x92s nice. (They start making out\nharder.)"
Ross	 Dude!'
Kathy's Co-Star	 Is that an expensive blouse?"
Kathy	 If you want it to be. '
Ross	 Here\xc2\x92s your girlfriend\xc2\x92s button. (Holding the button.)'

Phoebe	 Oh, hey, Mon, do you still have your like old blouses and dresses from\nhigh school?'
Monica	 Yeah, I think I have some around here somewhere. Why? '
Phoebe	 Well, it\xc2\x92s just that maternity clothes are so expensive.'
Monica	 Hey, Rach! I made a pile of your stuff over on this side of the room. If\nyou could just\xc2\x85(Rachel grunts and throws her purse at it)\xc2\x85throw your purses at\nit.'
Rachel	 Bloomingdale\xc2\x92s eliminated my department. (Phoebe gasps)'
Monica	 Oh my God, are you out of a job?'
Rachel	 No, but they stuck me in personal shopping. Which is just a huge\nstep down!'
Phoebe	 Personal shopping? What is that? Like where you walk around with snooty\nrich people and tell them what to buy?'
Rachel	 Uh-huh.'
Phoebe	 That sounds great!'
Joey	 (entering) Hey! (Goes to the fridge.)'
Monica	 Umm, excuse me, we switched apartments. You can\xc2\x92t eat are food\nanymore, that-that gravy train had ended.'
Joey	 (Holding a turkey leg) There\xc2\x92s gravy?'
Monica	 If you have the big apartment you have to deal with people coming over\nall the time. That fridge has got to be stocked, okay, that\xc2\x92s your department now.\n(She takes back the turkey leg)'
Monica	 What are you doing?'
Joey	 I think I left a donut up here.'
Ross	 Hey!'
Phoebe	 Hey!'
Joey	 Hey!'
Phoebe	 Ooh! How was Kathy\xc2\x92s play?'
Ross	 Well, Kathy gets half-naked and simulates sex with a real good\nlookin\xc2\x92 guy.'
Chandler	 Yeah, it\xc2\x92s like someone literally wrote down my worst\nnightmare and then charged me $32 to see it!'
Phoebe	 That\xc2\x92s a good idea for a business!'
Chandler	 I\xc2\x92m totally screwed. Okay, they are gonna be hot and heavy on\nstage every night, and then they\xc2\x92re gonna go to their cast parties and he\xc2\x92s\ngonna try to undermine me. Y\'know it\xc2\x92ll be like, "So where\xc2\x92s your\nboyfriend, what\xc2\x92s-his-name, Chester?" And she\xc2\x92ll go, "No-no-no,\nit\xc2\x92s Chandler." And he\xc2\x92ll go, "Whatever. Ha-ha-ha-ha!"'
Joey	 (to Ross) That-that is a good trick.'
Chandler	 All right, look, look, what am I gonna do?'
Joey	 Chandler, look they\xc2\x92re actors. They\xc2\x92re there to do a job, just\n\xc2\x91cause they work together, doesn\xc2\x92t mean they\xc2\x92re gonna get together. I mean\njust \xc2\x91cause it happened with Susan Sarandon and Tim Robbins, it doesn\xc2\x92t mean\nit\xc2\x92s gonna happen with them.'
Ross	 Oh-oh, Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger.'
Joey	 Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman. '
Ross	 Yeah.'
Phoebe	 Hey, Mel Gibson and Clint Eastwood.'
Ross	 They\xc2\x92re not a couple!'
Phoebe	 Oh-okay, I get the game now.'
Joey	 Okay look, look, let me ask you a question, when they were doing it on\nstage, was it like really hot?'
Ross	 Oh yeah!'
Joey	 Well okay, so then you\xc2\x92re fine. The rule is when two actors are\nactually doing it off-stage all the sexual tension between them is gone. Okay? So as long\nas it\xc2\x92s hot onstage you got nothing to worry about. It\xc2\x92s when the heat goes\naway, that\xc2\x92s when you\xc2\x92re in trouble.'
Chandler	 Really?'
Joey	 Look, you guys have been to every play I\xc2\x92ve ever been in, have I ever\nhad chemistry on stage?'
Ross	 No.'
Joey	 Noooo!!'
Chandler	 So uh, man, are you gonna go to the play with me tonight?'
Ross	 Y\xc2\x92know what, I don\xc2\x92t know how comfortable I am going to see how\nhot the sex is between some guy and your girlfriend.'
Chandler	 Yeah, I know but\xc2\x85'
Ross	 Oh no-no-no, I\xc2\x92m there.'
Monica	 (entering) Hey!'
Joey	 Hey Mon! Want some pancakes?'
Monica	 You made pancakes?'
Joey	 Yep! Grab a plate.'
Monica	 Okay. (She does so and starts to walk towards Joey to receive her\npancakes.)'
Joey	 No-no, stay right there. (Monica stops and Joey flips her a pancake, which\nflies over her head and lands in the living room.) Gettin\xc2\x92 closer.'
Chandler	 Okay, okay, but don\xc2\x92t worry, because we also have cereals,\nmuffins, waffles, and, jams, jellies, and marmalades. Which I\xc2\x92m fairly certain\nare the same thing.'
Joey	 Listen also we\xc2\x92re uh, we\xc2\x92re watching the game here Saturday\nnight, if people want to come over.'
Ross	 Oh yeah!'
Monica	 Oh, I was thinking about having people over for the game.'
Joey	 Oh yeah, who\xc2\x92s playing?'
Monica	 The players.'
Ross	 Somebody seems to be missing being the hostess.'
Monica	 (laughs) Please, it\xc2\x92s a relief is what it is, is what it is.'
Joey	 All right Pheebs, stick out your plate!'
Phoebe	 Oh. (Joey flips the pancake and Phoebe catches it and throws it on her\nplate.)'
Rachel	 (on the phone) Monica, I\xc2\x92m quitting! I just helped an 81 year old\nwoman put on a thong and she didn\xc2\x92t even buy it! (Pause) I\xc2\x92m telling you\nI\xc2\x92m quitting! That\xc2\x92s it! I\xc2\x92m talking to my boss right now! (Pause) Yes I\nam! (Pause) Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Okay bye, call me when you\nget this message. (Hangs up as her boss, Mr. Waltham, walks in.) Oh! Mr. Waltham, I ah\nreally need to talk to you.'
Mr. Waltham	 In a moment, please, I\xc2\x92m in the middle of a task. And you have\na customer. '
Rachel	 Hi!'
Joshua	 Hi, I\xc2\x92m Joshua.'
Rachel	 Hi, I\xc2\x92m Rachel Green. What can I do for you Joshua?'
Joshua	 Well, I need a whole new wardrobe. My wife, well my ex-wife\xc2\x85'
Rachel	 Oh, I\xc2\x92m so sorry.'
Joshua	 Anyway, she burned all of my clothes. I got away with two things. This\nsuit and what turned out to be a skirt.'
Rachel	 Well, at least that\xc2\x92s a great suit.'
Joshua	 Yeah, but it wasn\xc2\x92t much fun dropping it off at the dry cleaners in\nthe skirt. (Rachel laughs) So I need everything down to underwear, so if you\xc2\x92re\nwilling, I\xc2\x92m all yours.'
Rachel	 Okay.'
Mr. Waltham	 Rachel, you needed to speak to me?'
Rachel	 No-no, that wasn\xc2\x92t me! (To Joshua) Well, we should get started. Let\nme show you my underwear. (Joshua turns at that) The selection of underwear we carry.'
Rachel	 Oh-oh, sorry, it\xc2\x92s this way, it\xc2\x92s this way. (Motions to the\ncorrect way.)'
Joshua	 It\xc2\x92s this way? Sorry. (He walks past her and she again admires his\nbutt.)'
Chandler	 I\xc2\x92m right! Right? There was like no chemistry between them.\nBefore they had heat, and now there\xc2\x92s no heat! Now you know what this means, Joey\ntold us what this means!'
Ross	 All right, let\xc2\x92s not jump to any conclusions. All right? There was\nsome sexual chemistry between them.'
Chandler	 Come on, it was like cousins having sex up there!'
Ross	 Here she comes. Don\xc2\x92t say a word, okay? Just be cool, don\xc2\x92t\nbe\xc2\x85y'know you."
Kathy	 Hey you guys!'
Ross	 Hey!'
Kathy	 Hi! (Kisses Chandler) Thank you so much for coming again. Did you like it\ntonight?'
Ross	 Oh, absolutely! (Chandler mumbles something.)'
Kathy	 Wasn\xc2\x92t Nick funny when he couldn\xc2\x92t get his match lit?'
Kathy	 It\xc2\x92s a good play, isn\xc2\x92t it?'
Chandler	 Oh, I loved the play. You were great, and Nick ditto. Clearly\nyou\xc2\x92re having sex with him.'
Ross	 Okay, I\xc2\x85 (Walks away.)'
Kathy	 Clearly, I\xc2\x92m having sex with him?'
Chandler	 Oh come on, it was so obvious! There was no chemistry between you two!'
Kathy	 Okay, so let me just get this straight. You\xc2\x92re accusing me of\ncheating on you, and insulting my performance?'
Chandler	 Y\xc2\x92know, I-I could see how this could happen, y'know you\xc2\x92re\nup there every night, you\xc2\x92re naked, touching, kissing."
Kathy	 Acting! Chandler, this is my job! I\xc2\x92m-I\xc2\x92m playing a part in a\nplay! How can you not trust me?!'
Chandler	 Well, you can understand, given how we started.'
Kathy	 Oh, wow. I can\xc2\x92t believe you\xc2\x92re throwing that in my face.'
Chandler	 Well, that is what happened, and I don\xc2\x92t even see you denying\nthis!'
Kathy	 I\xc2\x92ll tell you what, Chandler, why don\xc2\x92t you call me when you\ngrow up!'
Chandler	 Yeah, well, don\xc2\x92t expect that to happen anytime soon!'

Rachel	 I have the best job in the entire world! The most adorable guy came over\ntoday, and I got to dress him up all day!'
Phoebe	 Rachel has a new doll.'
Rachel	 Oh, I wish he was a doll, then I could get a Rachel doll and bump them\ntogether and make kissy noises. Oh! And he has the most beautiful name, I never realised\nit, Joshua! Josh-u-a! Joshua! Josh.'
Ross	 Uh, hello!'
Rachel	 Hi-e!!'
Phoebe	 Ooh, what do I smell?'
Joey	 I don\xc2\x92t know, it smells good.'
Monica	 Fresh cookies! Hot from the oven!'
Phoebe	 Ooh! (They all go over to her apartment)'
Monica	 Please, have some!'
Ross	 Oh, yumm!'
Monica	 Yeah, I\xc2\x92ve just been fiddling around in here making delicious\ntreats for everyone.'
Joey	 (Holding a magazine) Wow! The new Playboy!'
Monica	 Yeah, it\xc2\x92s just something I picked up.'
Ross	 Cookies and porn, you\xc2\x92re the best mom ever!!'
Phoebe	 What? What?'
Rachel	 Well, it was just something Josh said about v-necks, but you had to be\nthere.'
Ross	 Yeah, how does Jason look in a v-neck?'
Rachel	 It\xc2\x92s Joshua.'
Ross	 Oh, whatever. (Laughs and gives Joey the thumbs up heading back to his\napartment. Joey follows him)'
Monica	 Wait! Wait! This isn\xc2\x92t take-out!'
Phoebe	 (getting up) Well, I hate to eat and run, but\xc2\x85'
Monica	 No, wait, please don\xc2\x92t go! I\xc2\x92ve got porn for you too!'
Phoebe	 Yeah, I don\xc2\x92t need it.'
Monica	 People are supposed to wanna hang out here!'
Rachel	 Why? Honey, what is the big deal?'
Monica	 I\xc2\x92m the hostess! Not those guys! I\xc2\x92m always the hostess! I\nmean, I was always the hostess, I mean even when I was little, I mean the girls brought\ntheir dollies to my tea party, I-I served the best air.'
Phoebe	 Well, why did you make like a whole big thing out of y'know, everyone\nhas to hang out in the big apartment?"
Monica	 \xc2\x91Cause they took our apartment, I wanted to punish them. But\nI\xc2\x92m-I\xc2\x92m done now. They\xc2\x92ve suffered enough.'
Phoebe	 If you wanted to punish them, you should\xc2\x92ve just made them hang out\nhere! '
Rachel	 Yeah, that\xc2\x92s true.'
Monica	 All right then, when I\xc2\x92m done with this place, it\xc2\x92s gonna be\nten times better than that place!'
Phoebe	 Oh, are we gonna trash that place?'
Chandler	 Steps! (He opens the door to his apartment to Ross and Joey looking at\nthe new Playboy) Slut! (Ross and Joey quickly hide the Playboy behind\ntheir backs. Chandler wonders into the girl\xc2\x92s apartment.) You will all be very happy\nto hear that Kathy is sleeping with that guy!'
All	 What?!'
Ross	 So you were right?'
Chandler	 I confronted her, and she didn\xc2\x92t deny it! (Pause) I don\xc2\x92t\nlive here! (Goes back into his apartment and they all follow him.)'
Ross	 Chandler!'
Rachel	 Chandler, what did she say?'
Phoebe	 Wait a minute.'
Joey	 Come here.'
Monica	 Are you sure?'
Chandler	 Well, I may be drunk, but I know what she said! Then I went over to Beefsteak\nJulie\xc2\x92s\xc2\x85'
Rachel	 Beefsteak Charlie\xc2\x92s?'
Chandler	 Yes! See you and I have always been like\xc2\x97(motions that they think\nthe same.)'
Rachel	 Whoops. (Starts to go into Chandler and Joey\xc2\x92s.) Oh, hey, do you\nneed help with that?'
Monica	 Nah, I got it.'
Rachel	 Ooh, I just feel bad, I never vacuum. (She goes into Chandler and\nJoey\xc2\x92s.)'
Rachel	 Hi!'
All	 Hey!'
Rachel	 So I was with Joshua for an hour today, and he has not asked me out.\nIt\xc2\x92s just so frustrating!'
Phoebe	 Why don\xc2\x92t you ask him out?'
Joey	 Oh, yeah, totally! That\xc2\x92s such a turn-on!'
Rachel	 Really? It doesn\xc2\x92t seem desperate?'
Joey	 Oh-ooh, that\xc2\x92s the turn-on.'
Phoebe	 He just got a divorce right? '
Rachel	 Hmm-mmm.'
Phoebe	 So he\xc2\x92s probably really nervous around women, y'know? Maybe, you\njust have to make the first move."
Rachel	 Yeah but, I\xc2\x92ve never asked a guy out before.'
Phoebe	 (shocked) You\xc2\x92ve never asked a guy out?!!'
Rachel	 No. Have you?'
Phoebe	 Thousands of times!! That doesn\xc2\x92t make me sound too good does it?'
Rachel	 I don\xc2\x92t even know how I would go about it.'
Joey	 Oh-oh-oh-oh, how I do it is, I look a woman up and down and say,\n"Hey, how you doin\xc2\x92?"'
Phoebe	 Oh, please!'
Joey	 (to Phoebe) Hey, how you doin\xc2\x92?'
Rachel	 You know what, I\xc2\x92m gonna do that, I\xc2\x92m gonna call him up, and\nI\xc2\x92m gonna ask him out. I can do that. Ask him out. (Practising) How you doin\xc2\x92?\n(Calls him) Hi! Joshua? It\xc2\x92s Rachel Green from Bloomingdale\xc2\x92s.\n(Listens) Yeah, umm, I was wondering if you umm, if you umm, left your wallet at the store\ntoday? Well, we found a wallet, and we\xc2\x97(Listens) the license? Well, that is a\ngood idea! Uh, well, let\xc2\x92s see here this says this license belongs to a uh, uh,\nbelongs to a mister uh, Pheebs, and umm, yeah, so sorry to bother you at home. I\xc2\x92ll\nsee you tomorrow. Bye. (Hangs up) (to Phoebe) You\xc2\x92ve done that a thousand times?'
Phoebe	 I\xc2\x92ve never done that.'
Rachel	 Ohh, God, I just got so nervous that he would say no.'
Joey	 Well, you gotta give him something that he can\xc2\x92t say no too. Like uh,\nKnicks tickets! Invite the guy to a Knicks game, you\xc2\x92re guaranteed he\xc2\x92ll say\nyes!'
Rachel	 Really?! You think that will work?'
Joey	 Absolutely! And if it doesn\xc2\x92t, can I get the extra ticket?'
Joey	 What the heck is that?'
Chandler	 Did she call?'
Phoebe	 No, sorry.'
Chandler	 All right, maybe I should call her.'
Joey	 No! Forget her, man! You don\xc2\x92t need her, you don\xc2\x92t need that!'
Ross	 He\xc2\x92s right, what she did was unforgivable.'
Chandler	 Well, yeah, but y'know, what-what if I was wrong?"
Ross	 How might you be wrong?'
Chandler	 Well y'know, what if she didn\xc2\x92t actually sleep with the guy?"
Joey	 Dude, tell me she actually told you this.'
Chandler	 She did not have to tell me, I saw the play, and there was no heat.\nBack me up here, Ross!'
Ross	 That\xc2\x92s all you\xc2\x92re basing this on?'
Chandler	 That\xc2\x92s not backing me up! Look, you said with the off-stage and\nthe heat, and the onstage and the oy heat.'
Joey	 Whoa-whoa, that-that was just a theory! There\xc2\x92s a lot of theories\nthat didn\xc2\x92t pan out. The lone gunman. Communism. Geometry.'
Chandler	 Oh my God!!'
Rachel	 Would you like to go to a basketball game with me? (Tries again.) You\nknow, its funny, basketball, because I happen to have tickets too\xc2\x85 (Tries again.)\nUmm, who likes the Knicks\xc2\x97(Joshua comes in from the dressing room.)'
Joshua	 What do you think?'
Rachel	 Oh! Well, as a single woman, who is available, I think you look great!'
Joshua	 Huh. (She starts brushing the lint off and checking him out in the\nmirror.) Yeah?'
Rachel	 Yep. Oh, yeah, look you great. (She puts her arm in his and checks how\nthey would look as a couple.) Oh yeah. Yeah, this looks great. (Pause) Umm, so you like\nit?'
Joshua	 I do. I do. I love it. In fact, I think I\xc2\x92m gonna wear it home.'
Rachel	 Great.'
Joshua	 All right, thank you so much for all your help. '
Rachel	 Sure.'
Joshua	 Well, I guess this is uh, I guess this is it.'
Rachel	 Yeah-eah-ha!'
Joshua	 Thanks. (He starts to leave) Maybe I\xc2\x92ll see in the spring, with the\nuh, y\xc2\x92know, for the uh, bathing suits.'
Rachel	 Oh well, you don\xc2\x92t want to do that now?!'
Joshua	 Ah, that\xc2\x92s okay, thanks.'
Rachel	 Okay.'
Joshua	 Anyway, hopefully, I\xc2\x92ll see you around sometime. (He goes out the\ndoor.)'
Rachel	 Basketball!'
Joshua	 (coming back in) I\xc2\x92m sorry.'
Rachel	 I uh, I have two tickets to the Knicks game tonight if you\xc2\x92re\ninterested, just as a thank you for this week.'
Joshua	 Wow! That would be great.'
Rachel	 Really?'
Joshua	 Yeah, that would be fantastic! My-my nephew is crazy about the Knicks!\nThis is fantastic, thank you so much Rachel. (He takes the tickets and leaves as Mr.\nWaltham returns.)'
Mr. Waltham	 Good morning.'
Joshua	 Hi!'
Kathy	 (opening the door) Hey.'
Chandler	 Hey. I just, I just wanted to come over to-to say that I\xc2\x92m sorry.\nY\xc2\x92know? I know I acted like the biggest idiot in the world, and I can completely\nunderstand why you were so upset.'
Kathy	 Oh wow. I really wish you\xc2\x92d call me.'
Chandler	 Yeah, I know, I-I wish I had too, but y\xc2\x92know I-I think this is a\ngood thing. Y'know? \xc2\x91Cause we\xc2\x92ve had our first fight, and now we can move on.\nY\xc2\x92know, I know for me\xc2\x97(Notices a pair of men\xc2\x92s pants on the chair.)\nNick\xc2\x92s pants?"
Kathy	 Yeah.'
Chandler	 Yeah. Well, I think our second fight is going to be a big one!'
Joey	 Okay, for next time, what do you say?'
Rachel	 I have an extra ticket. An extra ticket. Not, two tickets, I have an\nextra ticket.'
Ross	 So the first time you ask a guy out, he-he turns you down?'
Rachel	 He didn\xc2\x92t turn me down! He\xc2\x92s at the game isn\xc2\x92t he? I got\nthe date, I\xc2\x92m just not on it!'
Monica	 (entering) Okay, it\xc2\x92s ready. Come on.'
Joey	 What\xc2\x92s ready?'
Monica	 Just come. '
Ross	 Oh my God!'
Rachel	 Wow! Monica!'
Phoebe	 Great!'
Ross	 This is beautiful!'
Phoebe	 Oh did you\xc2\x97what did you\xc2\x97did you work for two days straight?'
Monica	 Pretty much. (to Joey) So, what do you, what do you think of the floor?'
Joey	 I don\xc2\x92t know, it looks the same.'
Monica	 You used to have carpet.'
Joey	 Oh yeah!'
Monica	 So I made snacks. Please, just hang out okay? I\xc2\x92m just gonna rest\nmy eyes just a little bit.'
Ross	 Look, Mon, do you want us to uh, come back later?'
Monica	 Oh no-no-no, stay, stay, stay, just keep talking. I\xc2\x92m always the\nhostess.'
Ross	 Hey!'
Joey	 How\xc2\x92d it go?'
Chandler	 Well, she wasn\xc2\x92t sleeping with him.'
Phoebe	 Oh good!'
Chandler	 She is now.'
Ross	 What are you saying?'
Chandler	 I\xc2\x92m saying that she\xc2\x85 is a devil woman! Y\xc2\x92know I mean\nyou think you know someone and then they turn around and they sleep with Nick! Nick, with\nhis rock hard pecs, and his giant man-nipples! I hate him, I hate her! Well, I\ndon\xc2\x92t hate her, I love her. This is all my fault really.'
Phoebe	 How? How is your fault?'
Chandler	 Because, I-I should\xc2\x92ve called! Y\xc2\x92know if I had just called\nher after our big, stupid fight, she never would\xc2\x92ve gone out with Nick, and they\nwould\xc2\x92ve ended up in bed together. I threw her at his man nipples!'
Rachel	 Honey, this is not your fault, just because you guys had a fight, it\ndoes not justify her sleeping with someone.'
Ross	 Well, if-if she thought they were on a break\xc2\x85'

Mr. Waltham	 Rachel, one of your customers seems to have left his billfold. A\nJoshua Bergen. '
Rachel	 Really?'
Mr. Waltham	 Will you call him?'
Rachel	 Yes! I will! Absolutely! (She takes out his license and her license and\nholds them face to face with each other. She then proceeds to act like Dark Helmut in Spaceballs,\nand mimic a conversation between the two of them.) Hello, Rachel. Hi, Joshua. I left my\nwallet here on purpose. Really? Yes, I just wanted to see you again. Oh, I\xc2\x92m glad.\nRachel, I\xc2\x92d like to say something to you. Yes? How you doin\xc2\x92?'
