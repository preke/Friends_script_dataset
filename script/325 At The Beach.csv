Chandler	 (to Bonnie) So ah, your first sexual experience was with a woman?!'
Bonnie	 All right, I was 15, it was my best friend, Ruth, and we got drunk on\nthat hard cider, and then suddenly, I don\xc2\x92t know, we were, we were making out.'
Chandler	 Tell it again. (pause, we see Rachel is not amused.) Seriously.'
Rachel	 (to Monica) I mean is that woman capable of talking about anything else\nbut sex?'
Joey	 Yeah, sure. Well y'know, earlier she was talking about geography."
Monica	 Joey, she was listing the countries she\xc2\x92s done it in.'
Joey	 Well, I think we all learned something.'
Phoebe	 (entering, hurridly) Hey, you guys! Look what I found! Look at this!\n(She hands Chandler a picture) That\xc2\x92s my Mom\xc2\x92s writing! Look.'
Chandler	 (reading the back of the picture) Me and Frank and Phoebe, Graduation\n1965.'
Phoebe	 Y'know what that means?"
Joey	 That you\xc2\x92re actually 50?'
Phoebe	 No-no, that\xc2\x92s not, that\xc2\x92s not me Phoebe, that\xc2\x92s\nher pal Phoebe. According to her high school yearbook, they were like B.F.F. (Ross and\nBonnie look at her quizzically) Best Friends Forever.'
All	 Oh!'
Rachel	 That is so cool.'
Phoebe	 I know! So this woman probably could like have all kinds of stories\nabout my parents, and she might even know like where my Dad is. So I looked her up, and\nshe lives out by the beach. So maybe this weekend we could go to the beach?'
All	 Yeah! Yeah, we can!'
Bonnie	 (to Ross) Shoot! I can\xc2\x92t go, I have to work!'
Ross	 That\xc2\x92s too bad.'
Rachel	 (sarcastic) Ohh, big, fat bummerrr.'
Phoebe	 So great! Okay! Tomorrow we\xc2\x92re gonna drive out to Montauk.'
Joey	 Hey, Bonnie had sex there!'

Monica	 (watching a happy couple walk by, arm in arm) Would you look at them. Am\nI ever gonna find a boyfriend again? I gonna die an old maid.'
Chandler	 You\xc2\x92re not gonna die an old maid, maybe an old spinster cook.'
Monica	 (sarcastic) Thanks!'
Chandler	 Hey now besides, if worst comes to worst, I\xc2\x92ll be your boyfriend.'
Monica	 Yeah right.'
Chandler	 Why is that so funny?'
Monica	 You made a joke right? So I laughed.'
Chandler	 Ha-ha-ha. A little to hard. What am I not ah, boyfriend material?'
Monica	 Well, no. You\xc2\x92re Chandler. Y'know, Chandler! (hits him on the arm)"
Chandler	 Okay, so we\xc2\x92ve established my name, and hit me. But theoretically\ny'know, I mean say we weren\xc2\x92t friends, say it\xc2\x92s a blind date. I show up at your\ndoor, and I\xc2\x92m like (in a fake voice) \xc2\x93Hey, nice to meet, ya. Hey, oh-hey.\xc2\x94"
Monica	 Well I\xc2\x92d probably be scared of a guy using a fake voice.'
Joey	 (walking up carrying a brown paper bag) Hey!'
Monica	 Oh, hey! Oh good, you brought food!'
Joey	 No, it\xc2\x92s just my luggage.'
Chandler, Monica, and Joey	 Hey!!'
Joey	 Woo-hoo! All right! Yeah!'
Phoebe	 Oh, I am having the best karma this week. First, I find this woman who\nknew my parents, and then my client with the fuzzy back gives me his beach house.'
Ross	 Yeah? What about ah, that bike messenger you hit?'
Phoebe	 Oh, I wasn\xc2\x92t talking about his karma.'
Rachel	 (approaching) Hey! '
Chandler	 Hey!'
Joey	 Hey-hey, check out the hat!'

Chandler	 What a minute, I know that hat! I was taken aboard that hat! They did\nexperiments on me! I can\xc2\x92t have children!!'
Monica	 Seriously, where did you get the hat?'
Rachel	 Ross gave it to me.'
Ross	 Yeah, I think she looks good.'
Rachel	 Ohh, thank you.'
Chandler	 Buy it for ya, or win it for ya?'
Rachel	 Well excuse me, my fashion-impaired friends, I am here to tell you that\nhats are back.'
Phoebe	 And this time, they\xc2\x92ve ganged up to form one giant, super hat.'
Ross	 Go, go, go!'
Rachel	 Oh yeah, now everybody wants to be under this hat!'
Phoebe	 Oy!!'
Monica	 What\xc2\x92s with all this sand? (picking a handful of sand off of the\nfloor, which is covered in sand)'
Phoebe	 Oh, yeah, Bob said there might be flood damage.'
Ross	 Yeah, either that, or he has a really big cat.'
Phoebe Sr	 Well, yes, it\xc2\x92s kind\xc2\x92ve an unusual house. It has umm, three\nbeautiful bedrooms and ah, no baths. But y'know, the ocean is right there."
Phoebe	 (at the door) Knock, knock, knock.'
Phoebe Sr	 (on phone) Ah, oh, hang on a second. (to Phoebe) Come in, come in.\n(on phone) All right, so think about it, and call me back. (hangs up)'
Phoebe	 (entering) Are you ah, Phoebe Abott?'
Phoebe Sr	 Ahh, yes.'
Phoebe	 Hi Phoebe Abott, I\xc2\x92m your best friends daughter!'

Phoebe	 No-no, sorry. Cookies are good, thanks. '
Phoebe Sr	 Oh.'
Phoebe	 (goes and gets some cookies) Well, so, umm, anyway umm, I\xc2\x92ve been,\nI\xc2\x92ve been looking for my Father, and umm, have you heard from him, or seen him?'
Phoebe Sr	 Oh no, I-I\xc2\x92m sorry, I guess we lost track of everybody after\nhigh school.'
Phoebe	 (disappointed) Oh, okay. Well, so tell me everything about my parents.\nEverything.'
Phoebe Sr	 Ohh, well. Y'know we were always together, in fact the had a nickname\nfor the three of us."
Phoebe	 Oh, what? What was it?'
Phoebe Sr	 The three losers. Oh, poor Lily. (Phoebe notices a picture on the\nfridge, takes it, and puts it in her pocket.) Ohh, y'know I-I heard about what happened,\nthat must have been just terrible for you, losing your mother that way."
Phoebe	 (happily) Yeah, no, it was great.'

Monica	 (gasps) Totally familiar. (Phoebe shows the rest of them.)'
Rachel	 Oh, yeah.'
The Guys	 Yeah!'
Monica	 Well, why would she lie to you?'
Phoebe	 I don\xc2\x92t know, but we\xc2\x92re having dinner tomorrow night, so I\nfigured, she\xc2\x92s gonna tell me then. Y'know maybe she just wanted to give him time to,\nbuy me presents, I don\xc2\x92t know! So, you\xc2\x92re all bored?"

And now if I go up there, and-and I kiss her, and, Gooood I wanna kiss her,\nand-and-and it doesn\xc2\x92t work out, right? Do I really wanna put myself through that\nagain?"
