Chandler	 Y'know, I can't believe I'm getting my nails done!\xc2\xa0 And you\nsaid it was gonna be fun! (pause) Which it kinda is.\xc2\xa0 Also, you said there would be\nother guys here. There are no other guys here!"
Rachel	 Chandler, there\xc2\x92s a guy right over there. (Points to the counter)'
Chandler	 That\xc2\x92s a mailman! That\xc2\x92s our mailman! (Waves to the\nmailman) (Sarcastic) Hi. How are ya?'
Rachel	 Chandler, don\xc2\x92t worry! This doesn\xc2\x92t make you any less of a\nguy! (Chandler starts blowing on his fingernails like women do.) That does!\n(Chandler stops blowing.) What am I sitting on? (She looks and finds a huge nail.) I hate\nto think what this woman was scratching when this broke off.'
Chandler	 Hey, you know who used to have nails like that?'
Rachel	 Hmm.'
Woman	 OH\xc2\x85MY\xc2\x85GAWD!! (Yep, you guessed it. It\xc2\x92s Janice.)'

Monica	 Joey let me ask you a question. What does this light switch do?'
Joey	 Ohh, Nothing.'
Monica	 Didn\xc2\x92t it drive you crazy to have a switch and not know what it\ndid?'
Joey	 I know what it did! Nothing.'
Monica	 They wouldn\xc2\x92t have put it there if it didn\xc2\x92t do something! How\ncan you not care?'
Joey	 Like this. (Shrugs)'
Rachel	 Well, here\xc2\x92s another question for ya. Uhh, do you know what that\nsilver knob on the toilet does?'
Joey	 Sure! It flushes it.'
Rachel	 Okay, good. Now that since you know, when you come over would you mind\nactually using it?'
Chandler	 (entering, with Janice in tow) Hello!'
Joey	 Hey! (Sees Janice.) Ah!! (Janice screams in surprise.)'
Rachel	 Guess who we ran into today?!'
Monica	 Janice?!'
Chandler	 Isn\xc2\x92t this amazing? '
Monica	 How have you been?'
Janice	 Oh well, I\xc2\x92m divorced.'
Phoebe	 Ohhh, wow.'
Janice	 Yeah, I\xc2\x92m riding the alimony pony. (Does the now famous laugh.)'
Joey	 And there it is.'
Janice	 I just came up to say, "Hi!" Hi! (to Chandler) And you,\nsweetie, I\xc2\x92ll see you tonight.'
Chandler	 Okay. Bye.'
Janice	 Bye.'
Chandler	 Bye.'
Janice	 Bye.'
Chandler	 Bye.'
Janice	 Bye.'
Chandler	 B-bye!'
Janice	 Bye-bye.'
Chandler	 Bye. (Finally closes the door on her.) (After it\xc2\x92s closed) I\ncan\xc2\x92t stand the woman! (Phoebe is shocked, Joey is relieved.)'
Phoebe	 What?! I thought you were crazy about her!'
Chandler	 Yeah, I know, but all of those little annoying things she did before\nwe fell in love? Like her voice, her laugh, her personality\xc2\x97Well, they\xc2\x92re all\nback! Y\xc2\x92know? And she\xc2\x92s picked up like nine new ones!'
Joey	 So what are you doing bringing her here?! There\xc2\x92s people here!'
Chandler	 Don\xc2\x92t worry about it. I\xc2\x92m taking care of it tonight.\n(Chandler opens the fridge and grabs something to drink.)'
Rachel	 You are not. You have never been able to break up with her.'
Chandler	 (standing in the door of the fridge) Well, I don\xc2\x92t have to break\nup with her this time. We\xc2\x92re not involved! I\xc2\x92m going to do a pre-emptive strike!\nI\xc2\x92m going to end it with her before it starts. My ass is like frozen! (Closes the\nfridge.) '
Joey	 Yeah, try sticking it in the freezer for 20 minutes. (They all look around\nand then back at Joey.) I\xc2\x92m tellin\xc2\x92 ya!'
Emily	 I can\xc2\x92t believe you really walk alone here! I mean, you hear such\nstories about New York.'
Ross	 No, it\xc2\x92s really not that bad. I mean, I-I for one, feel perfectly\nsafe.'
Ross	 Help! Help!! Help! Help!!'
Emily	 No, no, no Ross! Ross, these are friends of mine from home. (Introducing\nthem) Liam, Devon, this is Ross.'
Devon	 Hey, mate.'
Liam	 How are ya man?'
Ross	 Oh hey, that was a good one, huh? (Imitating himself) Help! Help!'
Emily	 So how are you? I\xc2\x92ve been meaning to ring you ever since I arrived\nbut umm, well, I\xc2\x92ve been rather busy.'
Devon	 Do you realise that we have not seen each other since the night of that\nU2 concert?'
Emily	 Oh my God. I think you\xc2\x92re right.'
Liam	 (puts his arm around her) Well, actually the last time you and I saw each\nother was that morning.'
Emily	 Oh, Liam. (Ross laughs and takes her back.)'
Ross	 Oh, Liam. So uh, what, were you guys playing soccer or something\xc2\x97or\nshould I call it (In an English accent) football?'
Devon	 We were playing rugby.'
Liam	 In fact we\xc2\x92re playing a game at the park tomorrow. You\xc2\x92re\nwelcome to play too if you want.'
Emily	 (laughs) Ross play rugby? I don\xc2\x92t think so.'
Ross	 What\xc2\x92s ah, what\xc2\x92s so funny about that?'
Emily	 Well I mean, you\xc2\x92re American to start with. You don\xc2\x92t even have\nrugby here.'
Ross	 Well, we didn\xc2\x92t have freedom here until 1776, either so\xc2\x85'
Devon	 So good then! We\xc2\x92ll see you at Riverside Park at 2
Liam	 Cheers!'
Ross	 Cheers!'
Janice	 Oh boy, I just love to sing!'
Chandler	 Yes, I-I know that you do, but I think one of the reasons people were\ncomplaining though, was that they paid to hear the actor sing Old Man River.'
Janice	 Oh, look at us! Who would\xc2\x92ve thought that Cupid had a station at\n14th Street Nails. (Does the laugh)'
Chandler	 (laughs) Okay, we have to talk. I\xc2\x92m just getting out of a very\nserious relationship\xc2\x85'
Janice	 I know! And I\xc2\x92m just getting out of a marriage, I mean talk about\nmeant to be!'
Chandler	 Right! I just think that this is happening too soon.'
Janice	 Oh, too soon, too schmoon. Face it honey, I am not letting you get away\nthis time.'
Chandler	 I hear ya. (Pause) But! Unfortunately, my company is transferring me\noverseas!'
Janice	 Oh no! Where to? (Gasps) Too Paris?'
Chandler	 No! No! Not, Paris. '
Janice	Too London? No-no, Rome? Vienna? Ooh-ooh, Barcelona?'
Chandler	 Okay, could you just stop talking for a second? (Thinks) Yemen.\nThat\xc2\x92s right, yes, I\xc2\x92m being transferred to Yemen!'
Janice	 When?'
Chandler	 I don\xc2\x92t know exactly.'
Janice	 Ugh, well I will just have to soak up every once of Chandler Bing until\nthat moment comes.'
Chandler	 But I do know that it\xc2\x92s some time tomorrow.'
Monica	 Done?'
Phoebe	 Yep!'
Rachel	 (entering, with Joey) Hey!'
Joey	 Hey! What\xc2\x92s up?'
Monica	 This switch thing has been driving me crazy. So I turned it off and\nchecked every outlet. Now, four of them don\xc2\x92t work. Which means, one of them\nhas to be controlled by the switch. So, I plugged in things in all four of the outlets\nthat-that make noise, so that way, when I turn it on I just follow the noise and find out\nwhich one it is.'
Joey	 (to Rachel) I bet I stopped listening before you did.'
Rachel	 Y\xc2\x92know, you-you also could\xc2\x92ve used uh, lamps and then\nfollowed the light.'
Monica	 Yeah, well, I\xc2\x92m using noise. Okay. All right! So, is everybody\nready? Here we go. (She flips on the switch and a hum starts.) I hear something! I hear\nsomething! Where is it? (They all start looking until Rachel realises it\xc2\x92s Joey.)'
Rachel	 It\xc2\x92s coming from Joey!'
Phoebe	 Oh my God, that\xc2\x92s so freaky! Turn him off!!'
Phoebe	 Ooh, hey, could we put on the news? I think it might be raining.'
Ross	 Oh, just hold on a second. I\xc2\x92m watching this rugby thing on ESPN.\nI don\xc2\x92t know what the big deal is. I\xc2\x92m man enough to play this sport.'
Joey	 Dude, you\xc2\x92re not even man enough to order the channel that\ncarries the sport.'
Janice	 (entering) Hey there Ross!'
Ross	 (shocked) Hey!'
Phoebe	 (whispering to Ross) Janice.'
Chandler	 Y\xc2\x92know uh, you didn\xc2\x92t really have to help me pack.'
Janice	 Ohh, well when you said all you were going to be doing between now and\nthe time you leave is packing, you didn\xc2\x92t really leave me much choice. Did you?'
Chandler	 Well, I-I thought I did but, I-I guess I did not!'
Joey	 Hey-hey, what\xc2\x92s going on?'
Chandler	 Oh, I\xc2\x92m packing. Y\xc2\x92know I\xc2\x92m-I\xc2\x92m packing\n\xc2\x91cause I\xc2\x92m moving to Yemen tomorrow.'
Joey	 Thanks for telling me!'
Chandler	 I\xc2\x92m only going to pretend I\xc2\x92m moving to Yemen, it\xc2\x92s the\nonly way I can get rid off her.'
Joey	 Ohhhh, good one! And Yemen that actually sounds like a real country.'
Janice	 (leaning in from the bedroom) Chandler! Come on, I\xc2\x92m gonna show how\nto roll up your underwear and stuff it in your shoes. It\xc2\x92s a real space saver.'
Phoebe	 Yeah, I know, I do that \xc2\x91cause it makes me look taller.'
Janice	 Okay, Chandler, come on!'
Chandler	 (to Janice) Okay. (to Joey) Joey, trade lives with me!'
Joey	 Nope. (To Ross) Man look at this! Ross, I can\xc2\x92t believe you said\nyou\xc2\x92d play rugby. I mean look how brutal this is!'
Ross	 Hey, I can handle it! All right?'
Rachel	 Please, Ross, you-you got hurt playing badminton with my dad.'
Ross	 That\xc2\x92s \xc2\x91cause-\xc2\x91cause you\xc2\x92re mom\xc2\x92s dog kept-kept\nlooking at me.'
Joey	 (pointing to the TV) Okay, Ross, look-look-look-look, look right here.\nThat\xc2\x92s called a scrum, okay? It\xc2\x92s kinda like a huddle.'
Ross	 And is a hum, kinda like a scruddle?'
Joey	 Ross! (Laughs) They\xc2\x92re gonna kill you!'
Phoebe	 Well, why are you doing this anyway?'
Ross	 Well, you should\xc2\x92ve seen the guy that she used to go out with. I\nmean, he\xc2\x92s like Joe Rugby.'
Phoebe	 You\xc2\x92re kidding! And he plays rugby?! That\xc2\x92s so funny.\n(Realises) Ohh! I see how you did that. All right.'
Ross	 Anyway, she thought the very idea of me playing rugby with him was\nlike hilarious. So I\xc2\x92m gonna show her how tough I really am!'
Rachel	 (starts laughing, Ross stares at her) I\xc2\x92m sorry. I\xc2\x92m sorry.\nYou\xc2\x92re right, you are a tough guy. You\xc2\x92re the toughest palaeontologist I know.'
Joey	 All right, come on look, Ross can take care of himself! It\xc2\x92s not like\nhe\xc2\x92s\xc2\x85Chandler!'
Chandler	 (from his bedroom) Thanks!'
Ross	 Look, don\xc2\x92t worry about me. Okay? I\xc2\x92ll just stay real energetic\nand stay away from the ball. I\xc2\x92ll uh, I\xc2\x92ll be that guy right out of the circle.\n(He points to a player who starts running and then gets viscously tackled from behind.)'
All	 Oh!'
Rachel	 Oh, well maybe there was a dog lookin\xc2\x92 at him.'

Joey	 Ross-Ross-Ross-Ross! Stay away from that guy (Points), and that guy\n(Points). And that one\xc2\x97Dude! They\xc2\x92re all huge!'
Ross	 They don\xc2\x92t look any bigger than me!'
Joey	 Well, maybe that\xc2\x92s because you\xc2\x92re closer to you. So you look\nbigger to you from where you are.'
Emily	 I\xc2\x92m just going to say hi to the lads. All right?'
Ross	 All right.'
Emily	 Okay. (Goes to say hi to the lads.) '
Phoebe	 (to the player) Hi.'
Phoebe	 Whoa! (The player leaves and to Joey) I kinda liked it.'
Ross	 Okay, I know what I have to do. I\xc2\x92ve got to go Red Ross. (Joey and\nPhoebe don\xc2\x92t know what he\xc2\x92s talking about.) Y\xc2\x92know, Red Ross!'
Joey	 I totally don\xc2\x92t know what you\xc2\x92re talking about.'
Ross	 Come on! The time we were all waiting in line for Dances With Wolves and\nthat one guy cut in line in front of us and I just lost it?! Screamed at him! Turned all\nred! Red Ross!!'
Joey	 No.'
Ross	 You\xc2\x92ll see.'
Emily	 Liam, do me a favour. Tell the lads to go easy on Ross, it\xc2\x92s his\nfirst time.'
Liam	 You don\xc2\x92t say! (We see Ross who is hopping about with the ball and\nspikes it in his face.)'
Emily	 (to Ross) Good luck, babe.'
Liam	 Ross! Ross! Come on! Get in here! (Ross gets pumped up.) Ross! Come on!'
Liam	 Ross, come on! Get in the bloody scrum! Ross, get in!'
Ross	 JOEY!!!!!!'
Rachel	 You\xc2\x85are\xc2\x85not going to believe it! Joshua came into work today,\nand guess what happened?'
Monica	 He asked you out?!'
Rachel	 No. But I was showing him some cufflinks and I felt his pulse.'
Monica	 Saucy!'
Rachel	 (refers to the table) What are these?'
Monica	 Electrical plans for the building.'
Rachel	 Okay, okay, okay should I be scared?'
Monica	 I know that switch does something, okay? So-so I went down to city hall\nand got these. All I had to do was pay $25 and wait in line for three hours.'
Rachel	 Wow! If only more people knew.'
Chandler	 Y\xc2\x92know you, really didn\xc2\x92t have to take me to the airport.'
Janice	 Oh please. Every moment is precious. Y\xc2\x92know? Besides, somebody had\nto ride in that other taxi with the rest of your luggage, and your friends don\xc2\x92t\nreally seem to care too much that you\xc2\x92re leaving.'
Chandler	 Well, we\xc2\x92re really not that close. (Pause) Okay, so I guess this\nis uh, good-bye then.'
Janice	 On no! No! It\xc2\x92s not good-bye, I\xc2\x92m not leaving until you get on\nthat plane.'
Chandler	 Okay. Then I guess it\xc2\x92s just, wait here then. (Hands her the sign\nthat says, Wait Here.") (To the ticket agent) Hi. I need one fake ticket to Yemen.'
Ticket Counter Attendant	 One ticket to Yemen?'
Chandler	 Oh no-no-no, no. No, no, no, I just, I just need a pretend ticket.'
Ticket Counter Attendant	 I\xc2\x92m sorry sir, I don\xc2\x92t understand. '
Chandler	 What would you give to a kid if he wanted a ticket to play with?'
Ticket Counter Attendant	 Are you travelling with a child?'
Chandler	 No. All right, y\xc2\x92know what, she\xc2\x92s (Points to Janice) gonna\nthink that I\xc2\x92m handing you a credit card, but what I\xc2\x92m really gonna do is hand\nyou a library card.'
Ticket Counter Attendant	 Ah, sir a ticket to Yemen is $2,100 and we don\xc2\x92t\ntake library cards.'
Janice	 What\xc2\x92s the matter? Is something wrong? Do you have to stay?'
Chandler	 (to the ticket agent) American Express?'
Emily	 I can\xc2\x92t believe they\xc2\x92re doing that to him! I told them to go\neasy on him!'
Phoebe	 No offence but, y\xc2\x92know sometimes it\xc2\x92s hard to understand you,\ny\xc2\x92know with the accent, so\xc2\x85'
Emily	 That\xc2\x92s just halftime, there\xc2\x92s more of this.'
Ross	 Did you see me? I was pretty good, huh? That is one fun game!'
Emily	 Right.'
Ross	 (to Emily) Hey, could you do me a favour? Could you just grab me a bottle\nof water? '
Emily	 Okay.'
Ross	 Thanks. (When she\xc2\x92s gone he collapses into Joey.) I-I think I\xc2\x92m\ndying. I really do. '
Phoebe	 Oh, poor baby.'
Ross	 (to Phoebe) Tell my son that I love him. (Emily returns with the water.)\nExcellent! Well, okay, I gotta have some more fun!'
Emily	 Ross, they are killing you out there!'
Ross	 (whines "No.") That\xc2\x92s not true!'
Phoebe	 She\xc2\x92s right! You have to stop!'
Ross	 What? No! No, I\xc2\x92m not stopping. I\xc2\x92m Red Ross!'
Joey	 Dude, if you go back out there, you\xc2\x92re gonna be Dead Ross!'
Ross	 I don\xc2\x92t care! I am not quitting! I insist on finishing this game!'
Emily	 All right, all right, if you insist on doing this, at least let me help\nyou.'
Ross	 No, God no! That is no place for a woman. Those guys will grab anything.'
Emily	 No. That\xc2\x92s not what I\xc2\x92m saying. I just may know a few things\nthat might help you inflict some pain.'
Ross	 I like that.'
Emily	 Yeah? Listen closely, Devon has got a weak ankle. '
Ross	 Huh?'
Emily	 One swift kick and he\xc2\x92ll back off.'
Ross	 All right, bad ankle, got it!'
Emily	 And that big bloke with the beard, he has got a trick hip. Yeah. And uh,\nand David over there, I heard he doesn\xc2\x92t wear a cup.'
Ross	 Yeah? I can use that, trick hip, no cup, okay! Okay!'
Emily	 And uh, Liam, Liam\xc2\x92s got bad knees. You hit him right and he\xc2\x92ll\ngo down like a lamp.'
Ross	 But-but, Liam\xc2\x92s on my team.'
Emily	 I don\xc2\x92t care! You just get him!'
Ross	 I\xc2\x92m gonna go get him! Okay, I am going back in! (Squeals like a\nmadman.)'
Joey	 The Red Ross! Okay.'
Rachel	 Hey!'
Monica	 Hi!'
Rachel	 (noticing a bunch of pictures around the door that weren\xc2\x92t there\noriginally.) What-what are-what are these?'
Monica	 Oh, just some pictures I made and hung up. I thought they\xc2\x92d\nbrighten up the place. They do don\xc2\x92t you think?'
Monica	 No-no-no, no!'
Monica	 I know that there\xc2\x92s no hole there, I just really liked that\npicture.'
Rachel	 Oh my God! Look at this!'
Monica	 Okay, but there is a wire back there! I mean that switch is\nconnected to something!'
Rachel	 I don\xc2\x92t care! The wires have come loose in your head!'
Monica	 I just thought that if I could follow the wire I could find out what it\ndid.'
Rachel	 And did you?!'
Monica	 No. It disappears back there behind that baseboard. For a minute there,\nI thought it went downstairs.'
Monica	 But it didn\xc2\x92t. Say hello to Mrs. Chatracus.'
Rachel	 Oh my God.'
Mrs. Chatracus	 Hello darling.'
Rachel	 Hello, Mrs. Chatracus.'
Phoebe	 Now, are you sure you don\xc2\x92t want to go see a doctor?'
Ross	 Oh no! That-that\xc2\x92ll just bring me down! This was great! I mean I-I-I\nwas great! This is a great day! Y\xc2\x92know what? I\xc2\x92m buying everyone coffee. All\nright? If someone would just grab my wallet, it\xc2\x92s in my pocket. '
Joey	 Yeah, sure.'
Ross	 No, not you. (Emily gets it.)'
Joey	 Uhh, look, your eye\xc2\x92s still popping out a little, I\xc2\x92m gonna go\nget some ice.'
Phoebe	 Ooh, ice! I am so in the mood for ice! (They go and get the coffee and\nthe ice leaving Ross and Emily alone.)'
Emily	 You were amazing out there.'
Ross	 Oh, I kinda was, wasn\xc2\x92t I?'
Emily	 Oh my God!'
Ross	 I made a man twice my size cry. I mean, I haven\xc2\x92t done that since I\nwas four and I washed my dad\xc2\x92s Porsche with rocks.'
Emily	 You really enjoyed yourself didn\xc2\x92t you?'
Ross	 Please! Are you kidding? I-I hurt three huge men, I gave a guy a bloody\nnose\xc2\x97I mean I-I\xc2\x92m not proud of it but, I really am. And it\xc2\x92s all because of\nyou, wonderful, amazing you.'
Emily	 I think you\xc2\x92ve got concussion.'
Ross	 No, no, I\xc2\x92m serious. Thank you.'
Emily	 You\xc2\x92re welcome. (She hugs him tightly and he winces.) I\xc2\x92m\nsorry. Did I hurt you?'
Ross	 It\xc2\x92s worth the pain. (She goes to hug him again.) Y\xc2\x92know what,\nyou know what? It\xc2\x92s not.'
Ticket Counter Attendant	 (on the P.A.) This is the final boarding call for\nFlight 664 to Yemen.'
Chandler	 Well, I-I guess I gotta go.'
Janice	 Oh, my Bing-a-ling. I\xc2\x92ll wait for you. Do you even know how long\nyou\xc2\x92re going to be gone?'
Chandler	 Well, just until we find an energy source to replace fuel.'
Janice	 Oh. Well, I\xc2\x92ll right you everyday. (Reading the address) 15 Yemen\nRoad, Yemen.'
Chandler	 Okay, good-bye. Good-bye. '
Janice	 Chandler?'
Chandler	 No!'
Janice	 Chandler! '
Chandler	 Janice! There you are! There you are! I had to have one last kiss, and\nalso-also you said that you were going to leave right after I got on the plane!'
Janice	 No! No! I wanna see you take-off.'
Chandler	 Well, I then guess I\xc2\x92m going to Yemen! I\xc2\x92m going to Yemen!\n(To this old woman also going to Yemen.) When we get to Yemen, can I stay with you?'

Monica	 All right. The super couldn\xc2\x92t figure out what it did. A $200 an\nhour electrician couldn\xc2\x92t figure out what it did. I\xc2\x92ve had seven pretty serious\nshocks. I officially give up.'
Rachel	 Thank God.'
Monica	 I guess Joey was right, it does nothing.'
Phoebe	 See? I\xc2\x92m doing it. I am totally doing it. (Suddenly it stops\nworking.) I lost it.'
