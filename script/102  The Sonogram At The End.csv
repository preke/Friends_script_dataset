Monica	 What you guys don't understand is, for us,\nkissing is as important as any part of it. "
Joey	 Yeah, right!.......Y'serious? "
Phoebe	 Oh, yeah! '
Rachel	 Everything you need to know is in that first kiss. '
Monica	 Absolutely. '
Chandler	 Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act,\ny'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd\ncomes out. "
Ross	 Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that...\nthat's not why we bought the ticket. "
Chandler	 The problem is, though, after the concert's over, no matter how great\nthe show was, you girls are always looking for the comedian again, y'know? I mean, we're\nin the car, we're fighting traffic... basically just trying to stay awake. "
Rachel	 Yeah, well, word of advice
Joey	 (pause)....Are we still talking about sex?'

Ross	 No, it's good, it is good, it's just that- mm- doesn't she seem a little\nangry? "
Marsha	 Well, she has issues. '
Ross	 Does she. '
Marsha	 He's out banging other women over the head with a club, while she sits\nat home trying to get the mastodon smell out of the carpet! "
Ross	 Marsha, these are cave people. Okay? They have issues like 'Gee, that\nglacier's getting kinda close.' See? "
Marsha	 Speaking of issues, isn't that your ex-wife? "
Ross	 (trying to ignore her) No. No. '
Marsha	 Yes, it is. Carol! Hi! '
Ross	 Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in\nthe Ice Age. "
Ross	Hi. '
Carol	 So. '
Ross	 You look great. I, uh... I hate that. '
Carol	 Sorry. You look good too. '
Ross	 Ah, well, in here, anyone who... stands erect... So what's new? Still,\nuh... "
Carol	 A lesbian? '
Ross	 Well... you never know. How's, um.. how's the family? "
Carol	 Marty's still totally paranoid. Oh, and, uh- "
Ross	 Why- why are you here, Carol? '
Carol	 I'm pregnant. "
Ross	 Pregnant?! '
Chandler	 Oh, I think this is the episode of Three's\nCompany where there's some kind of misunderstanding. "
Phoebe	...Then I've already seen this one! (Turns off the TV.) "
Monica	 (taking a drink from Joey) Are you through with that? '
Joey	 Yeah, sorry, the swallowing slowed me down. '
Monica	 Whose little ball of paper is this?! '
Chandler	 Oh, uh, that would be mine. See, I wrote a note to myself, and then I\nrealised I didn't need it, so I balled it up and... (sees that Monica is glaring at him)\n...now I wish I was dead. "
Phoebe	 She's already fluffed that pillow... Monica, you know, you've already\nfluffed that- (Monica glares at her.) -but, it's fine! "
Monica	 Look , I'm sorry, guys, I just don't wanna give them any more ammunition\nthan they already have. "
Chandler	 Yes, and we all know how cruel a parent can be about the flatness of a\nchild's pillow. "
Phoebe	 Monica- Hi! Um, Monica, you're scaring me. I mean, you're like, you're\nlike all chaotic and twirly. And not-not in a good way. "
Joey	 Yeah, calm down. You don't see Ross getting all chaotic and twirly every\ntime they come. "
Monica	 That's because as far as my parents are concerned, Ross can do no wrong.\nY'see, he's the Prince. Apparently they had some big ceremony before I was born. "
Chandler	 (looking out the window) Ew, ew, ew, ew ew ew ew ew! '
Monica	 What? '
Chandler	 Ugly Naked Guy got a Thighmaster! '
All	 Eeaagh! '
Rachel	 Has anybody seen my engagement ring? '
Phoebe	 Yeah, it's beautiful. "
Rachel	 Oh God, oh God, oh God oh God oh God oh God.... (Starts to look under\nthe couch cushions.) '
Phoebe	 No, look, don't touch that! "
Rachel	 Oh, like I wasn't dreading tomorrow enough, having to give it back to\nhim... 'Hi Barry! Remember me? I'm the girl in the veil who stomped on your heart in front\nof your entire family!' Oh God and now I'm gonna have to return the ring, without the\nring, which makes it so much harder... "
Monica	 Easy Rach, we'll find it. (To all) Won't we! "
Chandler and Joey	 Oh! Yeah!'
Joey	 Alright, when'd'ya have it on last?"
Phoebe	 Doy! Probably right before she lost it! '
Chandler	 You don't get a lot of 'doy' these days... "
Rachel	 I know I had it this morning, and I know I had it when I was in the\nkitchen with... '
Chandler	 ...Dinah? '
Rachel	 (looks at the lasagne and realizes something) Ohhhhh, don't be mad... "
Monica	 You didn't. "
Rachel	 Oh, I am sorry... '
Monica	 I gave you one job! (Starts to examin the lasagne through the bottom of\nthe glass pan.) '
Rachel	 Oh, but look how straight those noodles are! '
Chandler	 Now, Monica, you know that's not how you look for an engagement ring\nin a lasagne... "
Monica	 (puts down the lasagne) I just... can't do it. "
Chandler	 Boys? We're going in. "
Ross	 (standing outside the door).....Hi. '
Monica	 Wow. That is not a happy hi. '
Ross	 Carol's pregnant. "
Phoebe	 (while everyone else is stunned) Ooh! I found it! '
Monica	 W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-... '
Ross	 Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about\nnow. (He enters.) '
Chandler	 Kinda puts that whole pillow thing in perspective, huh, Mon? '
Rachel	 Well now, how-how do you fit into this whole thing? '
Ross	 Well, Carol says she and Susan want me to be involved, but if I'm not\ncomfortable with it, I don't have to be involved.. basically it's entirely up to me. "
Phoebe	 She is so great! I miss her. '
Monica	 What does she mean by 'involved'? "
Chandler	 I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done. '
Ross	 Anyway, they want me to go down to this- sonogram thing with them\ntomorrow. '
Rachel	 So what are you gonna do? '
Ross	 I have no idea. No matter what I do, though, I'm still gonna be a father. "
Joey	 .....Well, this is still ruined, right?'
Mrs. Geller	 Oh, Martha Ludwin's daughter is gonna call you. (Tastes a snack)\nMmm! What's that curry taste? "
Monica	 Curry. '
Mrs. Geller	 Mmmm! '
Ross	 I- I think they're great! I, I really do. "
Mr. Geller	 (To Ross) Do you remember the Ludwins? The big one had a thing for\nyou, didn't she? "
Mrs. Geller	 They all had a thing for him. '
Ross	 Aw, Mom... '
Monica	 I'm sorry, why is this girl going to call me? "
Mrs. Geller	 Oh, she just graduated, and she wants to be something in cooking,\nor food, or.... I don't know. Anyway, I told her you had a restaurant- "
Monica	 No Mom, I don't have a restaurant, I work in a restaurant. "
Mrs. Geller	 Well, they don't have to know that... (She starts to fluff the same\npillow Monica fluffed multiple times earlier.) "
Monica	 Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please? '
Ross	 Yeah. (They go to the kitchen.) '
Mrs. Geller	 Oh, we're having spaghetti! That's.... easy. "
Monica	 I know this is going to sound unbelievably selfish, but, were you\nplanning on bringing up the whole baby/lesbian thing? Because I think it might take some\nof the heat off me. '
Mrs. Geller	 What that Rachel did to her life.... We ran into her parents at the\nclub, they were not playing very well. '
Mr. Geller	 I'm not gonna tell you what they spent on that wedding... but forty\nthousand dollars is a lot of money! "
Mrs. Geller	 Well, at least she had the chance to leave a man at the altar... '
Monica	 What's that supposed to mean? "
Mrs. Geller	 Nothing! It's an expression. "
Monica	 No it's not. "
Mr. Geller	 Don't listen to your mother. You're independent, and you always have\nbeen! Even when you were a kid... and you were chubby, and you had no friends, you were\njust fine! And you would read alone in your room, and your puzzles... "
Mr. Geller	 Look, there are people like Ross who\nneed to shoot for the stars, with his museum, and his papers getting published. Other\npeople are satisfied with staying where they are- I'm telling you, these are the people\nwho never get cancer. "
Mr. Geller	 ...And I read about these women trying to have it all, and I thank\nGod 'Our Little Harmonica' doesn't seem to have that problem. "
Monica	 (trying desperately to change the subject) So, Ross, what's going on\nwith you? Any stories? (Digs her elbow into his hand.) No news, no little anecdotes to\nshare with the folks? "
Ross	 (pulls his hand away) Okay! Okay. (To his parents) Look, I, uh- I realise\nyou guys have been wondering what exactly happened between Carol and me, and, so, well,\nhere's the deal. Carol's a lesbian. She's living with a woman named Susan. She's pregnant\nwith my child, and she and Susan are going to raise the baby. "
Mrs. Geller	 (To Monica) And you knew about this?! '

Joey	 Your folks are really that bad, huh? '
Ross	 Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they\ntake their time, they get the job done. "
Monica	 Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you\ncould- (To Ross) -I'd want yours. "
Ross	 Must pee. (Goes to pee.) '
Phoebe	 Y'know, it's even worse when you're twins. "
Rachel	 You're twins? "
Phoebe	 Yeah. We don't speak. She's like this high-powered, driven career type. "
Chandler	 What does she do? '
Phoebe	 She's a waitress. "
Rachel	 All right, you guys, I kinda gotta clean up now. (They all start to\nleave.) '
Monica	 Chandler, you're an only child, right? You don't have any of this. "
Chandler	 Well, no, although I did have an imaginary friend, who... my parents\nactually preferred. '
Rachel	 The lights, please..'
Ross	 ...How long was I in there? '
Rachel	 I'm just cleaning up. "
Ross	 D'ya.. uh.. d'ya need any help? "
Rachel	 Uh.. okay, sure! Thanks! (She hands him the broom and sits down.) '
Ross	 Anyway.. um.. (Starts to sweep.) So, you- uh- you nervous about Barry\ntomorrow? '
Rachel	 Oh.. a little.. '
Ross	 Mm-hmm.. '
Rachel	 A lot. '
Ross	 Mm. '
Rachel	 So, got any advice? Y'know, as someone who's recently been- dumped? "
Ross	 Well, you may wanna steer clear of the word 'dumped'. Chances are he's\ngonna be this, this broken shell of a man, y'know, so you should try not to look too\nterrific, I know it'll be hard. Or, y'know, uh, hey!, I'll go down there, and I'll give\nBarry back his ring, and you can go with Carol and Susan to the OB/GYN... "
Rachel	 Oh, you've got Carol tomorrow.. When did it get so complicated? "
Ross	 Got me. '
Rachel	 Remember when we were in high school together? '
Ross	 Yeah. '
Rachel	 I mean, didn't you think you were just gonna meet somone, fall in love-\nand that'd be it? (Ross gazes at her.) ..Ross? "
Ross	 Yes, yes! '
Rachel	 Oh! Man, I never thought I'd be here.. (She leans back onto his hand.) "
Ross	 Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn't have to move his\nhand.) "
Ross	 (entering) Sorry I'm late, I was stuck at work. There was this big\ndinosaur.. thing.. anyway. "
Susan	 Hi. '
Carol	 Ross, you remember Susan. '
Ross	 How could I forget? '
Susan	 Ross. '
Ross	 (they shake hands) Hello, Susan. (To Carol) Good shake. Good shake. So,\nuh, we're just waiting for...? "
Carol	 Dr. Oberman. '
Ross	 ..Dr. Oberman. Okay. And is he- '
Susan	 She. '
Ross	 -she, of course, she- uh- familiar with our.. special situation? '
Carol	 Yes, and she's very supportive. "
Ross	 Okay, that's great. (Susan gives her drink to Carol.) No, I'm- Oh.\xc2\xa0 "
Carol	 Thanks. '
Ross	 (picks up a surgical instrament and mimes a duck with it) Quack, quack.. '
Carol	 Ross? That opens my cervix. (He drops it in horror.) '
Rachel	 Barry? '
Barry	 C'mon in. "
Rachel	 (hesitates) Are you sure? '
Barry	 Yeah! It's fine, it's fine. Robbie's gonna be here for hours. "
Robbie	 Huh?! '
Barry	 So, how ya doin? '
Rachel	 I'm- uh- I'm okay... You look great! "
Barry	 Yeah, well.. '
Bernice	 (over intercom) Dr. Farber, Jason Greenstein's gagging. "
Barry	 (answering the intercom) Be right there. (To Robbie and Rachel) Be back\nin a sec. '
Rachel	 I dumped him. '
Robbie	 Okay. '
Ross	 So, um- so how's this, uh, how's this gonna work? Y'know, with us? Y'know,\nwhen, like, important decisions have to be made? "
Carol	 Give me a 'for instance'. "
Ross	 Well, uh, uh, I don't know, okay, okay, how about with the, uh, with the\nbaby's name? "
Carol	 Marlon- '
Ross	 Marlon?! '
Carol	 -if it's a boy, Minnie if it's a girl. "
Ross	 ...As in Mouse? '
Carol	 As in my grandmother. '
Ross	 Still, you- you say Minnie, you hear Mouse. Um, how about, um.. how about\nJulia? '
Carol	 Julia.. '
Susan	 We agreed on Minnie. '
Ross	 'S'funny, um, uh, we agreed we'd spend the rest of our lives together.\nThings change, roll with the punches. I believe Julia's on the table..? "
Barry	 Sorry about that. So. What have you been up to? '
Rachel	 Oh, not much. I-I got a job. '
Barry	 Oh, that's great. "
Rachel	 Why are- why are you so tanned? '
Barry	 Oh, I, uh- I went to Aruba. '
Rachel	 Oh no. You went on our honeymoon alone? '
Barry	 No. I went with, uh.. Now, this may hurt. '
Robbie	 Me?! '
Barry	 No! (To Rachel) I went with Mindy. '
Rachel	 Mindy?! My maid of honour, Mindy?! '
Barry	 Yeah, well, uh, we're kind of a thing now. "
Rachel	 Oh! Well, um.. (Grabs his forehand) You've got plugs! "
Barry	 Careful! They haven't quite taken yet. "
Rachel	 And you've got lenses! But you hate sticking your finger in your eye! "
Barry	 Not for her. Listen, I really wanted to thank you. '
Rachel	 Okay.. '
Barry	 See, about a month ago, I wanted to hurt you. More than I've ever wanted\nto hurt anyone in my life. And I'm an orthodontist. "
Rachel	 Wow. '
Barry	 You know, you were right? I mean, I thought we were happy. We weren't\nhappy. But with Mindy, now I'm happy. Spit. "
Rachel	 What? '
Robbie	 Me. (Spits.) '
Rachel	 Anyway, um, (Gets the ring out of her purse.) I guess this belongs to\nyou. And thank you for giving it to me. '
Barry	 Well, thank you for giving it back. '
Robbie	 Hello?! '
Susan	 Oh, please! What's wrong with Helen? "
Ross	 Helen Geller? I don't think so. "
Carol	 Hello? It's not gonna be Helen Geller. "
Ross	 Thank you! '
Carol	 No, I mean it's not Geller. "
Ross	 What, it's gonna be Helen Willick? "
Carol	 No, actually, um, we talked about Helen Willick-Bunch. '
Ross	 Well, wait a minute, wha- why is she in the title? '
Susan	 It's my baby too. "
Ross	 Oh, 's'funny, really? Um, I don't remember you making any sperm. "
Susan	 Yeah, and we all know what a challenge that is! '
Carol	 All right, you two, stop it! '
Ross	 No no no, she gets a credit, hey, I'm in there too. "
Carol	 Ross. You're not actually suggesting Helen Willick-Bunch-Geller? 'Cause I\nthink that borders on child abuse. "
Ross	 Of course not, I'm... suggesting Geller-Willick-Bunch. "
Susan	 Oh, no, nonononono, you see what he's doing? He knows no-one's gonna say\nall those names, so they'll wind up calling her Geller, then he gets his way! "
Ross	 My way?! You-you think this is my way? Believe me, of all the ways I ever\nimagined this moment in my life being, this is not my way- y'know what? Uh, um, this is\ntoo hard. I'm not, I can't do- "
Dr. Oberman	 (entering) Knock knock!How are we today? Any nausea? '
All	 Yeah. Yeah. A little. '
Dr. Oberman	 Well, I was just wondering about the mother-to-be, but.. thanks for\nsharing. (To Carol) Uh, lie back.. '
Ross	 You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be\ninvolved in this particular thing right now. "
Ross	 Oh my God. '
Susan	 Look at that. '
Carol	 I know. '

Ross	 Well? Isn't that amazing? "
Joey	 What are we supposed to be seeing here? '
Chandler	 I dunno, but.. I think it's about to attack the Enterprise. "
Phoebe	 You know, if you tilt your head to the left, and relax your eyes, it\nkinda looks like an old potato. '
Ross	 Then don't do that, alright? "
Phoebe	 Okay! '
Ross	 (walks over to where Monica is standing)Monica. Whaddya think? '
Monica	 (welling up) Mm-hmm. '
Ross	 Wh- are you welling up? '
Monica	 No. '
Ross	 You are, you're welling up. "
Monica	 Am not! '
Ross	 You're gonna be an aunt. "
Monica	 (pushes him and starts to cry) Oh shut up! '
Rachel	 (on phone) Hi, Mindy. Hi, it-it's Rachel. Yeah, I'm fine. I-I saw Barry\ntoday. Oh, yeah, yeah he-he told me. No, no, it's okay. I hope you two are very happy, I\nreally do. Oh, oh, and Mind, y'know, if-if everything works out, and you guys end up\ngetting married and having kids- and everything- I just hope they have his old hairline\nand your old nose. (Slams the phone down.) (To everyone) Okay, I know it was a cheap shot,\nbut I feel so much better now. "
