Rachel	 I cannot believe that you didn\xc2\x92t tell me that we are still\nmarried!!'
Ross	 Look I was going to tell you!'
Rachel	 When?! After the birth of our first secret child?! (To All) Ross\ndidn\xc2\x92t get the annulment; we are still married.'
Chandler	 What?'
Monica	 You\xc2\x92re kidding!'
Phoebe	 (overdoing it) Oh my God!!'
Monica	 Ross!'
Ross	 Okay, maybe it wasn\xc2\x92t my best decision. But I just couldn\xc2\x92t face\nanother failed marriage.'
Chandler	 Okay, let me just jump in and ask, at what point did you think this\nwas a successful marriage?'
Ross	 Rach, come on, if you think about it, it\xc2\x92s actually kinda funny. (He\nlaughs, and he laughs alone.) Okay, maybe it\xc2\x92s best not to think about it.'
Phoebe	 Okay, this is inexcusable. I am shocked to my very core!'
Ross	 Phoebe, I told her you already knew.'
Phoebe	 Another lie. You have a sickness!'
Chandler	 Ross, just for my own piece of mind, you\xc2\x92re not married to\nanymore of us are ya?'

Joey	 Oh! Hey, somebody left their keys. (Looks at them) Ooohh, to a Porsche!\n{Transcriber\xc2\x92s note
Gunther	 Yeah, that\xc2\x92s what I drive. I make four bucks an hour, I saved up\nfor 350 years!'
Joey	 Na-uh! (To everyone there) Hey did anybody lose their keys?'
Monica	 Joey, why don\xc2\x92t you put them in the lost and found?'
Joey	 There\xc2\x92s a lost and found? (Gunther sets the box up on the table.) My\nshoe! (Grabs it out of the box.)'
Chandler	 You left a shoe here?!'
Joey	 Well, I didn\xc2\x92t realize until I got home. I wasn\xc2\x92t gonna walk all\nthe way back down here with one shoe! Y\xc2\x92know what? I\xc2\x92m gonna go find that\nguy\xc2\x92s car and leave a note on the windshield. (Goes to do so.)'
Chandler	 Oh good, when he comes back for his keys, I\xc2\x92ll be sure to give\nhim your shoe.'
Joey	 Great! Thanks. (Exits.)'
Phoebe	 (coming in from the bathroom) Oh, good, good, you guys are here! Listen,\nhow would like to spend tomorrow taking care of three incredibly cute little puppies?!'
Monica	 Oh my God, what a fun day! That sounds great!'
Chandler	 (not enthused) Yeah, all right.'
Phoebe	 Okay, well I\xc2\x92ll bring them by tomorrow morning. Okay, and uh, by\nthe way, they\xc2\x92re not actually puppies, they\xc2\x92re Frank and Alice\xc2\x92s triplets.\nOkay, see ya! (Exits.)'
Chandler	 Whoa-whoa-whoa! What?'
Phoebe	 (stops) Please! Please! Please! Please! Oh please! Please! Please! Frank\nand Alice asked me to baby sit the triplets and I\xc2\x92m nervous \xc2\x91cause I\xc2\x92ve\nnever done that before by myself!'
Monica	 Don\xc2\x92t worry about it Phoebe, we\xc2\x92ll absolutely do it.'
Chandler	 Yeah, I\xc2\x92m gonna pass. \xc2\x91Cause I was kinda iffy when it was\npuppies.'
Monica	 Come on Chandler, come on! It\xc2\x92ll give us great practice for\nwhen\xc2\x97(realizes what she\xc2\x92s about to say and changes)\xc2\x97people with babies come\nto visit.'
Guy #1	 Nice car!'
Joey	 Yeah, it\xc2\x92s not mine.'
Woman	 (walking up) I love your car.'
Joey	 Yeah, it\xc2\x92s (looks up and sees the woman) mine.'
Woman	 I bet it\xc2\x92s fast.'
Joey	 Me too! Yeah. And comfortable. Do uh, do you like leather seats?'
Woman	 Yeah!'
Joey	 (checks in the window to make sure it has them) It\xc2\x92s got \xc2\x91em!'
Rachel	 So, I still have boxes here. I still have boxes at Ross\xc2\x92s, and\nI have nowhere to live! Wow. I could so easily freak out right now.'
Phoebe	 What about me? I just found out that Denise is leaving town for a while,\nI don\xc2\x92t have a roommate.'
Rachel	 Well, maybe-maybe I could be your roommate Pheebs.'
Phoebe	 Maybe you could be my roommate!'
Rachel	 Well there\xc2\x92s an idea!!'
Phoebe	 Yeah!'
Rachel	 That would be great! Wait, how long is Denise gone for?'
Phoebe	 Umm, she said she\xc2\x92d be back December 26th. '
Rachel	 December 26th, huh maybe she\xc2\x92s Santa Clause.'
Rachel	 (deadpan) Oh look who it is, my husband. The apple of my eye.'
Ross	 Okay, I got us a court date for tomorrow at 2
Rachel	 Well sure, if you say you\xc2\x92re gonna take care of everything I have\nno reason to doubt you. Give me those forms! (Grabs them from him.) All right, now\nI\xc2\x92m gonna do this my way and I don\xc2\x92t want to hear a peep out of you!'
Ross	 Okay Rach, but\xc2\x85'
Rachel	 Op! You\xc2\x92re peeping!'
Rachel	 Ross! Y\xc2\x92know what, I just got\xc2\x97why? Why did you do this?!'
Ross	 Look I told you\xc2\x85'
Rachel	 I don\xc2\x92t wanna hear "Three failed marriages!"'
Ross	 Look, if you\xc2\x92d had two failed marriages, you\xc2\x92d understand!'
Rachel	 Well, y\xc2\x92know what? Thanks to you I\xc2\x92m half way there! Ugh! Oh!\nI am so mad! Ross, I don\xc2\x92t think I have ever been this angry!'
Ross	 What about the time I said we were on a break?'
Rachel	 Ugh! (Stares at him.)'
Monica	 Pheebs, how\xc2\x92s it going?'
Phoebe	 (rapidly) I\xc2\x92m doing okay. I think it\xc2\x92s going well. Do you\nthink they\xc2\x92re having fun? Am I talking to fast?'
Monica	 Nope, sound like me. Pheebs, it\xc2\x92s going great. Look at Chandler\nwith little baby girl Chandler.'
Chandler	 Little baby girl Chandler, where I have heard that before? Oh right,\nCoach Ruben. (Tries to get her to drink a little more from the bottle when he suddenly\nsmells something. It\xc2\x92s times like these I\xc2\x92m glad Smell-O-Vision hasn\xc2\x92t been\ninvented.) Do you know what Pheebs? When you\xc2\x92re done over there, we kinda have a\nsituation over here too. (Phoebe is changing hers.)'
Phoebe	 Na-uh, no, we are all responsible for our own babies.'
Chandler	 See that\xc2\x92s where I think that you\xc2\x92re wrong. We\xc2\x92ve been\nplaying these babies man for man; we should really be playing a zone defense.'
Monica	 What do you mean?'
Chandler	 I just think that things would go a lot smoother if we each have our\nown zone. Phoebe, you can be in charge of wiping. And y\xc2\x92know Mon, you can be in\ncharge of diapering and I can be in charge of looking how cute they are when they put\ntheir hands around\xc2\x85 (He degrades into baby talk, but he means when they grab his\nfinger.)'
Phoebe	 That sounds really great, but maybe you should be in charge of wiping.'
Chandler	 Okay, I\xc2\x92m a rookie. I should not be in the end zone.'
Monica	 This is so great! This is exactly how we set the plates at the\nrestaurant.'
Phoebe	 Yeah? (Checking the final diaper) Well this is not what I ordered.'
Joey	 (entering) Hey guys!'
Chandler	 Hey!'
Phoebe	 Hey!'
Joey	 Hey babies! Oh, I\xc2\x92m having the best morning. That uh, that Porsche\nI\xc2\x92ve got the keys too, still there!'
Chandler	 Shocking! Since you still have the keys.'
Joey	 You should see the treatment I get when I\xc2\x92m with that car! People are\nfriendly; they-they wanna talk, and not just about the car! One guy gave me advice about\nmy equity investments.'
Chandler	 What equity investments?'
Joey	 The ones that got me the Porsche! Will you keep up! (Chandler wipes his\nforehead with a baby wipe, that might have been used. He drops it disgustedly.) But I\nfigured, if-if people keep seeing me just standing there, they\xc2\x92re gonna start to\nthink that I don\xc2\x92t own it. So I figured I\xc2\x92ll wash it. Right? Monica, you got a\nbucket and some soap I can borrow?'
Monica	 Oh yeah, I got soap and sponges and rags and Carnuba wax and polishing\ncompound.'
Chandler	 You don\xc2\x92t even have a car!'
Monica	 I know. But umm, one time there was this really dirty car in front of\nthe building, so I washed it.'
Chandler	 And?'
Monica	 And six others.'
Chandler	 There you are.'
Joey	 Yeah, she tops out at 130.'
Guy #2	 Wow!'
Joey	 And that\xc2\x92s just in the city. I get her up to 160 when I take her\nupstate.'
Guy #2	 Really! You got a place upstate?'
Joey	 Sure!'
Guy #2	 Well, I\xc2\x92ll see you later.'
Joey	 Okay, take it easy.'
The Porsche Owner	 Hey! That\xc2\x92s my car.'
Joey	 Really? Oh uh, oh just give me five more minutes with it.'
The Porsche Owner	 What-what are you doing?'
Joey	 Oh I-I uh, found the keys and now I\xc2\x92m just polishing her up.'
The Porsche Owner	 But it\xc2\x92s my car!'
Joey	 Yeah, but it\xc2\x92s my wax.'
The Porsche Owner	 Listen, I-I-I don\xc2\x92t come to this city much so I\ndon\xc2\x92t know if you\xc2\x92re crazy or this is some kind of street theater, but could I\nhave my keys.'
Joey	 Sure. Here. (He hands them over.) I\xc2\x92ll uh, save your parking spot.'
The Porsche Owner	 I\xc2\x92m not coming back.'
Joey	 Why not?'
The Porsche Owner	 I live upstate.'
Joey	 Yeah, so did I.'
Phoebe	 I don\xc2\x92t know why I was so nervous about this. And I don\xc2\x92t know\nwhy Frank and Alice are always complaining. This is so easy.'
Monica	 Yeah, two hours, a lifetime that\xc2\x92s the same.'
Chandler	 (entering) Check it out! Check it out! When the babies wake up, they\ncan meet Krog! (He holds up this Xena-like warrior action figure.)'
Monica	 Chandler, what are you doing? That thing can put someone\xc2\x92s eye out!'
Chandler	 He can do more than that! He can destroy the universe!'
Phoebe	 No Chandler, they can swallow one of those little parts! And also, look\nat his smooth area, that\xc2\x92s just gonna mess them up.'
Chandler	 They\xc2\x92re not gonna swallow anything, you guys are being way over\nprotective. When I was a kid, my mom used to just throw me into a pile of broken glass!'
Phoebe	 What?!'
Chandler	 Glass, sand, whatever. (Walks out as Monica and Phoebe turn to check\non the babies again.)'
Phoebe	 Oh, look at little Leslie stretching in her sleep.'
Monica	 Oh it\xc2\x92s so cute. I wonder what age it is when you stop being able\nto put both legs over your head.'
Phoebe	 Oh, I can still do that.'
Monica	 How are you still single?!'
Chandler	 (entering) All right. (Clears throat) I thought about it and maybe\nyou\xc2\x92re right. Maybe Krog is not a safe toy.'
Monica	 Good. What made you change your mind?'
Chandler	 I swallowed the sonic blaster gun.'
Phoebe	 How did that happen?!!'
Chandler	 Well, I was trying to prove that I was right. Y\xc2\x92know? And it\nturns out I was wrong. And now it\xc2\x92s lodged in my throat. (Mimics a cat trying to\ncough up a hairball.) (He does it again.)'
Monica	 Damnit! Y\xc2\x92know this whole time we were concentrating on watching\nthe babies and, and no one was watching Chandler! (He does it again.)'
Judge	 Okay you two are asking the court for an annulment?'
Rachel	 Yes your honor, and here are, are forms, all filled out.'
Judge	 So based on your petition you are seeking an annulment on the grounds\nthat Mr. Geller is mentally unstable.'
Ross	 Fine, I\xc2\x92m mentally unstable.'
Judge	 And based on the fact that Mr. Geller is intravenous drug user.'
Ross	 What?!'
Rachel	 Uh yes, heroin and crack.'
Ross	 Crack isn\xc2\x92t even an intravenous drug!'
Rachel	 Well, you would know.'
Judge	 Now it also says here that you lied about your sexual preference before\nmarriage?'
Ross	 Oh, come on!'
Rachel	 (starts to cry) Ross, please, I found the magazines!'
Judge	 And finally that you were unable to consummate the marriage. Well, that\nmakes sense since you\xc2\x92re gay and addicted to heroin.'
Ross	 Okay, I\xc2\x92m sorry, this is insane! I-I-I\xc2\x92m not addicted to heroin,\nI\xc2\x92m not gay, and there is no problem with my ability to consummate anything!\nLook, I\xc2\x92ll consummate this marriage right here, right now!'
Judge	 That won\xc2\x92t be necessary.'
Ross	 And when we were dating we consummated like bunnies!'
Rachel	 Ugh!'
Judge	 Now if you were two involved in a serious relationship, that really\ncreates a problem.'
Rachel	 Ross! Your honor, rest assured relationship ended like two years ago!\n(To the stenographer) And could you strike "Consummated like bunnies" from the\nrecord?'
Judge	 Is there, anything in this record that is actually true?'
Rachel	 Well, yes, we got married in Vegas and uh, and the names I think.'
Judge	 Well, based on what I heard, you two certainly don\xc2\x92t qualify for an\nannulment. If you two don\xc2\x92t want to be together you\xc2\x92ll have to file for divorce.'
Ross	 (stands up) That\xc2\x92s great! Are you happy now? Look what you did with\nyour funny, funny form!'
Rachel	 (stands up as well) What?! Me?! What about you and your consummated like\nbunnies nonsense!'
Ross	 And what\xc2\x97(notices the stenographer is still typing)\xc2\x97What are you\ntyping that for? Did you hear what she said? We don\xc2\x92t get the annulment. Don\xc2\x92t\ntype that! What?! Stop typing! (He goes over to where the stenographer is typing and in\nthe process pushes Rachel out of his way.) Hey! Stop typing! (He\xc2\x92s still typing.)\nStop typing! Stop typing!!'
Rachel	 (to the judge) Okay, do you see, do you see what you\xc2\x92re keeping me\nmarried too?!'
Judge	 You need to get out of my chambers.'
Rachel	 All right look lady here is the deal, I came here for an annulment and I\nam not leaving here until I get one!'
Ross	 Yeah!'
Judge	 Would you like to spend the night in jail?'
Rachel	 And thank you for your time. (They both beat a hasty retreat.)'

Joey	 (entering wearing nothing but Porsche clothes) So the Porsche guy took his\ncar back.'
Chandler	 But you found the keys to his clothes?'
Joey	 No. No, I just uh, I just loved the way it feels when everybody thinks I\nown a Porsche.'
Monica	 And people will think you own a Porsche because you\xc2\x92re wearing the\nclothes?'
Joey	 Of course! Only an idiot would wear this stuff if you didn\xc2\x92t have the\ncar! Right?'
Chandler	 That is true.'
Phoebe	 Yeah, but only a genius would swallow a sonic blaster gun.'
Joey	 Oh, I\xc2\x92ve been there. Yeah, I am gonna go drive my Porsche. (Starts to\nleave.)'
Monica	 Joey, you know you don\xc2\x92t actually have one.'
Joey	 Come on! What are you doing?! I\xc2\x92m in character! Would you talk to\nher! (Storms out.)'
Chandler	 Ahh, I think it just moved. It\xc2\x92s really poking me.'
Monica	 All right, that\xc2\x92s it, we\xc2\x92re going to the emergency room.'
Phoebe	 What?! No, you can\xc2\x92t, you can\xc2\x92t leave me here with them!\nWe\xc2\x92re baby-sitting! '
Monica	 The babies are asleep, I\xc2\x92m sure you\xc2\x92ll be okay on your own for\na while!'
Phoebe	 But you-you can\xc2\x92t leave me with them! We-we\xc2\x92re a team!\nWe\xc2\x92re playing a zone! They\xc2\x92re gonna triple team me!'
Monica	 He\xc2\x92s got something plastic lodged in his throat, we\xc2\x92ve got to\ngo to the hospital.'
Phoebe	 But no, because a doctor won\xc2\x92t be able to help him, it\xc2\x92s just\ngonna y\xc2\x92know naturally pass through his system in like seven years.'
Chandler	 I think that\xc2\x92s gum.'
Phoebe	 I\xc2\x92m pretty sure it\xc2\x92s gun.'
Chandler	 Okay, listen this really hurts. Let\xc2\x92s go.'
Phoebe	 A real man wouldn\xc2\x92t just run to the hospital! (They don\xc2\x92t\nstop.) No! What would, what would Krog do? (They ignore her and Phoebe is left alone.)'
Joey	 Why isn\xc2\x92t that valet back with my Porsche?'
Passerby	 Maybe because you\xc2\x92ve got the keys?'
Joey	 (to women passing him) Porsche.'
Rachel	 This is totally your fault!'
Ross	 My fault?! You threatened the judge!'
Rachel	 Well, you ripped the paper out of the court reporter\xc2\x92s machine!!'
Ross	 That was the only way I could get him to stop typing!'
Joey	 Hi! How are the Gellers? '
Rachel	 Don\xc2\x92t call us that! (Storms away)'
Ross	 The judge wouldn\xc2\x92t let us get an annulment! Now we gotta get a\ndivorce!! Did a Porsch throw up on you? (Walks on.)'
Joey	 Hey! It\xc2\x92s Porsche!! (He\xc2\x92s right y\xc2\x92know.)'
Phoebe	 Me taking care of you is no problem, huh? You guys feel safe. Right?\nOkay, I\xc2\x92m gonna take that spit bubble as, "Yeah, I do!" Okay, after I get\nrid of this dirty diaper Leslie, I\xc2\x92ll set you up with a clean one. (She throws it at\nthe garbage without looking, misses, and knocks over a vase and flowers, which fall to the\nfloor and break.) Okay, I\xc2\x92m sorry. I didn\xc2\x92t mean to scare you. I just have to\nclean that up. Okay? \xc2\x91Cause let\xc2\x92s face it, we\xc2\x92re at Monica\xc2\x92s. (She\ncrawls over, disposes of the diaper, picks up the flowers, and the vase.) I broke it. All\nright. Well, that\xc2\x92s just the way that goes. (She throws out both the flowers and the\nvase.) Okay, good. (She turns around and only counts two babies.) Why are there only two\nof you? Where is Leslie? Well, you can\xc2\x92t answer. (She starts looking for her) Leslie?\nWhere are you Leslie? Leslie, now would be a good time for your first words! (She\nturns around and finds that Leslie has managed to crawl into the bottom drawer of the TV\ncabinet.) Well, look at you! Hey! You are a little bit mischievous! My gosh! (She picks\nher up and notices a surprise is waiting in the drawer.) Oh, you\xc2\x92re a lot\nmischievous! Well, it\xc2\x92ll dry. (Closes the drawer with her foot.) (To Leslie) Okay,\nyou sit with your brother and sister now\xc2\x97who aren\xc2\x92t there! (They both have\ndisappeared as well.)'
Chandler	 (entering) Hey!'
Phoebe	 (exhausted) How do you feel?'
Chandler	 Well, let\xc2\x92s just say that Krog will be fully equipped to destroy\nthe universe again in twelve to fourteen hours.'
Phoebe	 Okay, so I totally took care of the babies all by myself! I fed\n\xc2\x91em, bathed \xc2\x91em, and put \xc2\x91em to bed.'
Chandler	 And protected them from a tornado?'
Monica	 Oh my God.'
Phoebe	 I know, the babies are asleep.'
Monica	 Phoebe, what, what happened here?!'
Phoebe	 I did it! I took care of the babies all by myself!'
Monica	 But my apartment!'
Chandler	 Was the setting of Phoebe\xc2\x92s triumph.'
Monica	 But the mess!'
Chandler	 Is not as important as the fact that Phoebe took care of the babies\nall by herself.'
Monica	 You\xc2\x92re right, you\xc2\x92re right I shouldn\xc2\x92t freak out.\n\xc2\x91Cause this is what will happen when you and I have babies! When will that be?!'
Chandler	 (pause) Phoebe, would you take a look at this mess!!!!'
Rachel	 (deadpan) Oh honey thank God you\xc2\x92re home, I was getting worried.'
Ross	 I picked up the divorce papers. Uh, I\xc2\x92ve already signed everything\nand I put little \xc2\x91X\xc2\x92s where you need to sign.'
Rachel	 Oh, little \xc2\x91X\xc2\x92s! Great! That makes up for everything!'
Ross	 Y\xc2\x92know, I-I\xc2\x97you\xc2\x92ve done a lot of stupid stuff too! Okay?'
Rachel	 Oh, name one stupid thing that is as stupid as this one!'
Ross	 Okay, how about you flew to London to stop my wedding! Ah, how about you\ntold me you loved me after I was already married!'
Rachel	 Hey! Wait a minute! That was different! I did those things because I was\nin love with you!'
Ross	 Yeah! Right!'
Ross	 You\xc2\x92re right. That\xc2\x92s very different. So let\xc2\x92s, let\xc2\x92s\njust sign the papers. All right? (Sits down and Rachel keeps standing there.) What?'
Rachel	 Nothing. (Sits down.)'
Ross	 Okay, can we just sign please?'
Rachel	 Uh-hmm. (Just as Rachel finishes signing her name, Ross yanks each page\nout of the way.)'
Ross	 Congratulations. (Gets up to leave.)'
Rachel	 Okay Ross, we\xc2\x92re\xc2\x97wait a minute. Umm, I uh, I kinda have a\nlittle confession.'
Ross	 What?'
Rachel	 Well, y\xc2\x92know this whole marriage thing, kinda my idea.'
Ross	 Excuse me?'
Rachel	 Well, remember how we were too drunk to remember anything the night we\nwere married?'
Ross	 Yeah?'
Rachel	 And uh, yeah, I didn\xc2\x92t really, I didn\xc2\x92t want to say anything,\nbut it kinda it just, it kinda kept coming back to me, and umm, remember we were in the\ncasino and for some reason thought it would be funny to eat a lot of grapes. And uh, and I\nthought it would be funnier if we got married. So as a, as a compromise we decided first\nto get married, and then (Ross joins in) to eat a lot of grapes. So umm, sorry I got us\ninto this mess.'
Ross	 So then if-if\xc2\x97I mean if you think about it, this is all (Pause.) your\nfault.'
Rachel	 Yeah, don\xc2\x92t push it though.'
Ross	 I\xc2\x92ve got to say; I know I divorce a lot of women, never thought I\nwould be divorcing you.'
Rachel	 I know. I always thought if you and I got married, it would be the one\nthat stuck. And it wouldn\xc2\x92t be a secret, and we wouldn\xc2\x92t have our wedding dinner\nat Pizza Hut. (They both laugh.)'
Ross	 Did I, did I even treat?'
Rachel	 No, it was on the house, it was, it was a newlywed special.'
Ross	 That may be the most depressing thing I\xc2\x92ve heard in my life. I should\nprobably get these to my lawyer\xc2\x92s office.'
Rachel	 Hey, thanks Ross, for taking care of all of this.'
Ross	 Eh, no problem.'
Rachel	 I\xc2\x92m gonna need a copy of those.'
Ross	 Totally. (Exits.)'

Joey	 Hey! Hey! Be careful around my Porsche! '
Woman	 (the same one from before approaches) Hi Joey.'
Joey	 Hey! How you doin\xc2\x92?'
Woman	 (to her friend) He has the most amazing Porsche under there!'
Joey	 I\xc2\x92d love to show ya, but I just tucked her in. She\xc2\x92s sleeping.\n(The women both laugh) Hey uh, would you two girls like to go for a drink? (Just then the\nsame guy with the football dives to make a catch, lands on the car cover, and collapses\nit. It turns out that Joey set up a bunch of boxes to make it look like a Porsche.)'
