Joey	 (answering phone) Hello.'
Chandler	 (on phone) Hey, it\xc2\x92s me. I know you can\xc2\x92t stand to be in the\nsame room as me, so I just thought I\xc2\x92d try and apologize over the phone. All I\xc2\x85\n(Joey hangs up the phone in disgust.)'
Joey	 (answering phone) Hello.'
Chandler	 Look I never should have kissed your girlfriend, but I\xc2\x92m\xc2\x85\n(Joey hangs up the phone again.)'
Joey	 (answering phone) Stop callin\xc2\x92!!'
Voice	 (on phone) Hey! Hey! Hey! This is 92.3, WXRK, K-Rock for our $1,000 daily\nchallenge.'
Joey	 All right!'
Voice	 What is the name of your roommate who is very, very sorry and would do\nanything\xc2\x85 (Joey realizes it\xc2\x92s Chandler and hangs up the phone in anger.)'

Chandler	 (entering) Aww, turkey! Aww, giving thanks! Aww!'
Phoebe	 Look everyone, it\xc2\x92s the spirit of Thanksgiving!'
Rachel	 So are things with you and Joey any better?'
Chandler	 They couldn\xc2\x92t be worse. I spent eight hours calling him last\nnight, just trying to get him to talk to me.'
Rachel	 Oh wow, eight hours? So you could probably really use one of those\nplug-in telephone headsets huh?'
Ross	 Should we all expect Christmas gifts that can be stolen\nfrom your office?'
Rachel	 You shouldn\xc2\x92t.'
Phoebe	 Speaking of Christmas, umm since Monica and I are starting a new\nbusiness and have like no money, umm, this year maybe we could do secret Santa, and then\nwe each only buy one gift. And-and there\xc2\x92s the added mystery of who gets who.'
Ross	 Who gets whom. (They all look at him.) I don\xc2\x92t know why I do that.'
Rachel	 Well, I\xc2\x92m gonna take a nap, turkey makes me sleepy.'
Monica	 We haven\xc2\x92t eaten yet!'
Rachel	 I know, but all that work you\xc2\x92re doing to get it ready, I\njust\xc2\x85 (goes into her bedroom.)'
Chandler	 Hey, by any chance did either of pick uh Rachel for your secret Santa,\n\xc2\x91cause I wanna trade for her.'
Phoebe	 I picked her! Oh thank God you want her! Ooh!'
Chandler	 Wow! Why do you want to get rid of her so badly?'
Phoebe	 Because she exchanges every gift she ever gets, it\xc2\x92s like\nimpossible to get her something she likes. Come on, let\xc2\x92s trade!'
Chandler	 Oh that\xc2\x92s not true! That\xc2\x92s not true! I got her that backpack\nand she loved it! I remember how much she was crying the day when that big dog ran off\nwith it\xc2\x85 (notices the look on Monica and Phoebe\xc2\x92s faces.) Oh, there was no big\ndog. All right this sucks! I already got her this briefcase, and I had R.G. put on\nit\xc2\x85 (Phoebe looks confused.) Her initials\xc2\x85'
Phoebe	 Ohh.'
Monica	 Well, maybe you could give to somebody else. Ooh, like Ross Geller.'
Chandler	 Op, y'know what though, it\xc2\x92s kind\xc2\x92ve a girlie briefcase."
Monica	 Who cares? He works in a museum!'
Chandler	 Hey, what time is it? The big game is about to start!'
Phoebe	 You don\xc2\x92t have to do that, Ross and Joey aren\xc2\x92t here, you can\nwatch the parade if you want.'
Chandler	 Thanks.'
Monica	 What is wrong with this freezer?! (She jabs her arm into the freezer and\na piece of ice flies into her eye.) Ow! Ow!!'
Phoebe	 God, what happened?!'
Monica	 Oh my God, ice just got in my eye!'
Rachel	 (standing in her doorway) People are trying to sleep in here!'
Chandler	 Monica got ice in her eye, and it hurts.'
Phoebe	 Open it up, let me see.'
Monica	 Oh, y\xc2\x92know what, I can\xc2\x92t, it really kills.'
Chandler	 Well maybe you should put some ice on it.'
Phoebe	 Ooh, God it looks bad.'
Rachel	 Honey, maybe we should take you to a doctor.'
Monica	 No, my eye doctor is Richard! I can\xc2\x92t go to him when I don\xc2\x92t\nhave a boyfriend!'
Chandler	 He\xc2\x92s really picky about his patients.'
Phoebe	 Honey, you\xc2\x92ve got to go. What\xc2\x92s his office number?'
Monica	 Like I remember his office number! (Pause) Speed dial 7.'
Phoebe	 (on phone) Hi! Yeah, I\xc2\x92m calling on behalf of Monica Geller\xc2\x92s\neye, and is um, is Richard Burke in today. (Listens) (to Monica) He\xc2\x92s out of town,\nbut does she want to see the on-call doctor?'
Monica	 Yes!!'
Phoebe	 Yes! She\xc2\x92s very excited about that.'
Phoebe	 This is so cool, \xc2\x91til Monica gets back, it\xc2\x92s like I\xc2\x92m\nhead chef and I get to make all the decisions. (She looks at the remaining butter, and\nthen decides to add it to the dish.)'
Ross	 Hey-hey, I thought she told you to follow the recipe exactly!'
Phoebe	 Okay, get out of my kitchen!'
Chandler	 (entering) All right! Okay! I think I am making some progress with\nJoey, when I went into the apartment he went straight into his bedroom but he only slammed\nthe door once! (Ross is pleased.) I mean yeah, he gave me the finger while doing it.'
Phoebe	 All right I\xc2\x85 I gotta call my mom and ask her a left handed cooking\nquestion.'
Ross	 So listen ah, I picked Monica for secret Santa, but I\xc2\x92m already\ngetting her something for Chanukah, I was wondering if you wanna switch.'
Chandler	 Oh y\xc2\x92know what, I was already trying to trade for ah, well, you.'
Ross	 Really?! Wow! That\xc2\x92s-that\xc2\x92s so nice, what are you gonna get me?'
Chandler	 I don\xc2\x92t know R.G., I was thinking something girlie for your\noffice.'
Ross	 Yeah, well maybe Phoebe will switch with me.'
Chandler	 Oh no-no-no, you don\xc2\x92t want to do that, then you\xc2\x92re gonna\nget stuck with Rachel and she exchanges every gift she ever gets.'
Ross	 Oh, that\xc2\x92s not true! I\xc2\x92ve got her lots of stuff she never took\nback.'
Chandler	 Like?'
Ross	 Like uh, that gold necklace I got her last year.'
Chandler	 When was the last time you saw her wear it?'
Ross	 Well, she wore it all Christmas day, and then uh\xc2\x85'
Chandler	 Big dog?'
Ross	 (entering) Hey!'
Joey	 Hey!'
Ross	 What are you doing?'
Joey	 I\xc2\x92m sending back all this stuff that Chandler bought out of guilt.'
Ross	 Everything? Even the TV?'
Joey	 No! I\xc2\x92m putting that in my room.'
Ross	 Listen, Joey, I know what he did was wrong but don\xc2\x92t you think you\ncould at least hear the guy out?'
Joey	 Back when you and Rachel were together, if Chandler had kissed her, would\nyou hear him out?'
Ross	 That\xc2\x92s a good point. So uh, how long are you gonna punish him?'
Joey	 Five years. '
Ross	 You\xc2\x92ve sentenced him?!'
Joey	 Hey! Don\xc2\x92t do the crime if you can\xc2\x92t do the time.'
Ross	 Joey, the guy\xc2\x92s your best friend.'
Joey	 No, was my best friend. Anyway, I don\xc2\x92t know why\nyou\xc2\x92re pushing for him so hard. With him out of the way as my best friend,\nthere\xc2\x92s a spot open.'
Ross	 Oh, who? Me?'
Joey	 Yeah!'
Ross	 Wow! I\xc2\x92m honored! And y\xc2\x92know what I\xc2\x92m gonna do as my first\nact as your best friend?'
Joey	 What?'
Ross	 I\xc2\x92m gonna get you to talk to Chandler.'
Joey	 All right. But if you weren\xc2\x92t my best friend.'
Kathy	 Oh my God, is it really that bad?'
Chandler	 I walk into a room and he won\xc2\x92t even talk to me, he just mumbles\nsomething in Italian. And I know he only knows the bad words.'
Joey	 (entering) Hey Gunther, have you uh, have you seen Chandler?'
Gunther	 I thought you were Chandler. But umm, one of who is over\nthere.'
Kathy	 Oh.'
Chandler	 Hey Joe.'
Joey	 (Something in Italian.) (Storms out.)'
Doctor	 I\xc2\x92ll be right with you. Okay? (to the nurse) Thanks, Wendy.'
Monica	 Oh my God! How cute is the on-call doctor?'
Rachel	 Ooh, so cute, that I\xc2\x92m thinking about jamming this pen in my eye.'
Nurse	 Dr. Burke will see you know.'
Monica	 Oh no-no-no, not Dr. Burke. Dr. Burke is out of town. The-the on-call\ndoctor will see me now.'
Nurse	 Dr. Richard Burke is out of town. Dr. Timothy Burke, his son, will see\nyou now.'
Dr. Timothy Burke	 Ready?'
Chandler	 Hey! I\xc2\x92m sorry! That\xc2\x97(sees that Joey is about to leave)\nwhere are you going?'
Joey	 My folks.'
Chandler	 Oh, uh, when-when are you coming back?'
Joey	 I don\xc2\x92t know. I might stay there for a few days while I look for an\napartment.'
Chandler	 What?!'
Joey	 Yeah, y\xc2\x92know at first I thought we could talk about this y\xc2\x92know,\nwork it out, but uh, seeing you two together I don\xc2\x92t think I\xc2\x85'
Chandler	 Hey, look, what do you want me to say? Do you want me to say that\nI\xc2\x92ll stop seeing her?'
Joey	 Look, it\xc2\x92s not about her. Okay? But seeing you two together just\nreminds me of what you did. And I don\xc2\x92t want to live with some one who doesn\xc2\x92t\nknow what it is to be a friend. So, I\xc2\x92ll see ya. (He starts to leave, but Chandler\ngrabs his bag and stops him.)'
Chandler	 Hey, look, I know what it is to be a friend, I just-I just screwed up!'
Joey	 Yeah! You did! And that\xc2\x92s why I\xc2\x92m leaving.'
Chandler	 All right look, if you\xc2\x92re not gonna stay for me, then at least\nstay for them! Okay, they have had a very difficult year! What with the\nrobbery and all!'
Joey	 When that guy was robbing us, and I was locked in the entertainment unit\nfor like six hours, you know what I was doing in there all that time? I was thinking about\nhow I let you down! '
Chandler	 What?'
Joey	 Yeah! But if would\xc2\x92ve know what kind of friend you were gonna turn\nout to be, I wouldn\xc2\x92t have worried about it so much! See you around!'
Chandler	 All right, wait! Come on! Just wait one second! There has to be\nsomething that I can do! Something! If we still had that entertainment unit I would get in\nit for six hours and think about how I let you down. (Joey looks intrigued) What?'
Joey	 We\xc2\x92ve got a box. (Motions to a large wooden box next to him.)'

Tim	 Last time I saw you, it was the morning I left for college. And you were\njust standing outside The Dairy Queen.'
Monica	 I was probably waiting for it to open.'
Tim	 I gotta tell you, you look great now.'
Monica	 You look great too.'
Tim	 You\xc2\x92re an excellent patient!'
Monica	 So how does it look?'
Tim	 Well, you\xc2\x92ve got a little scratch on your cornea, your gonna have to\nwear a patch for a couple of days.'
Monica	 Like a pirate?!'
Tim	 If that helps you. '
Monica	 Umm, so how long have you been working with your dad? (He looks at her)\nCome on, one of us had to mention him.'
Tim	 I moved back here a couple of months ago.'
Monica	 Oh. Big family dinner tonight?'
Tim	 Uh. (He holds up a brown lunch bag.)'
Monica	 No way!'
Tim	 I was gonna have Thanksgiving at my girlfriend\xc2\x92s.'
Monica	 (disappointed) Oh.'
Tim	 But we broke up.'
Monica	 (happy) Oh. '
Tim	 She-she wasn\xc2\x92t ready for a serious commitment.'
Monica	 (sympathetic) Oh. (in a pirate\xc2\x92s voice) So you made her walk the\nplank? Aye, matie?'
Tim	 You\xc2\x92re not wearing the patch yet.'
Monica	 I know.'
Ross	 He\xc2\x92s coming here for Thanksgiving!'
Rachel	 I know, it\xc2\x92s sick.'
Monica	 Why is it sick?'
Rachel	 Because it\xc2\x92s Richard\xc2\x92s son! It\xc2\x92s like inviting Greek\ntragedy over for dinner!'
Monica	 Hey, come on, Phoebe, you understand don\xc2\x92t you?'
Phoebe	 Yeah, I can see where I\xc2\x92d be your best shot but, no. I\xc2\x92m\nsorry, but I think it\xc2\x92s twisted.'
Ross	 Yeah.'
Joey	 (coming out of the bathroom) What\xc2\x92s twisted?'
Monica	 Me going out with Richard\xc2\x92s son.'
Joey	 Ewwwww!! Ew! Ew! Ew!'
Chandler	 (He is now in the box, in their living room.) Sounds like a really bad\nidea to me.'
Rachel	 Is he okay in there?'
Joey	 He\xc2\x92s fine!'
Ross	 Hey, y'know, Mon, if things wrong out between you and Richard\xc2\x92s son,\nyou\xc2\x92d be able to tell your kids, that you slept with their grandfather."
Monica	 Fine! Judge all you want to but, (points to Ross) married a lesbian,\n(points to Rachel) left a man at the altar, (points to Phoebe) fell in love with a gay ice\ndancer, (points to Joey) threw a girl\xc2\x92s wooden leg in a fire, (points to Chandler)\nlivin\xc2\x92 in a box!! (goes to her room)'
Rachel	 So now, what exactly is the point of the box?'
Joey	 Chandler?'
Chandler	 The meaning of the box is three fold. One (holds a finger up through\nthe air hole), it gives me the time to think about what I did. Two (holds up another\nfinger), it proves how much I care about my friendship with Joey. And three (holds up a\nthird finger), it hurts!'
Ross	 (to Rachel) Oh hey! Hey uh, you remember the necklace I gave you last\nyear? Can I see it?'
Rachel	 (worried) Why?'
Ross	 I just wanna check something.'
Rachel	 Okay. (She goes into her bedroom)'
Ross	 (He puts his hand over the hole on the box.) (to Chandler) Now, we\xc2\x92ll\nsee.'
Chandler	 Air hole! Air hole!! (Ross retracts his hand quickly.)'
Rachel	 (coming out of her bedroom with a necklace) Here it is! I love it. I\nwear it all the time.'
Ross	 (grabbing the necklace) The necklace I got you was gold, this one is\nsilver.'
Rachel	 Huh, well maybe it uh, it changed. '
Ross	 Oh my God! You actually exchanged it!'
Rachel	 Well isn\xc2\x92t it better that I exchanged it for something that I enjoy\nand that I can get a lot of use out of?'
Ross	 What did you get?'
Rachel	 Credit. '
Monica	 (running in from her bedroom) I\xc2\x92ll get it! I\xc2\x92ll get it!\nI\xc2\x92ll get it! I\xc2\x92ll get it! I\xc2\x92ll get it! I\xc2\x92ll get it! I\xc2\x92ll get it!\nI\xc2\x92ll get it! I\xc2\x92ll get it! I\xc2\x92ll get it! I\xc2\x92ll get it! I\xc2\x92ll get it!\nI\xc2\x92ll get it! I\xc2\x92ll get it! (opens the door) Hi, Tim.'
Tim	 Hi. (gives her a bottle of wine)'
Monica	 Thank you. Come meet my friends. This is uh, Phoebe. '
Tim	 Hi, nice to meet you.'
Monica	 And Joey.'
Joey	 Hey!'
Tim	 Hi, Joey.'
Monica	 My brother, Ross.'
Ross	 Hey.'
Monica	 And Rachel. (Chandler clears his voice loudly) And that\xc2\x92s Chandler.'
Chandler	 How do ya do.'
Tim	 What\xc2\x92s\xc2\x85'
Monica	 Umm, well, he\xc2\x92s\xc2\x85'
Joey	 He\xc2\x92s doin\xc2\x92 some thinkin\xc2\x92!'
Chandler	 What happened? What happened?!'
Joey	 You kissed my girlfriend!'
Rachel	 Ooh, I like those sunglasses.'
Ross	 Like \xc2\x91em, like \xc2\x91em? Or, I\xc2\x92d like to get store credit for\nthat amount like \xc2\x91em?'
Rachel	 (Swears in Italian, it\xc2\x92s the same term used by Joey earlier and\nJoey nods his approval.)'
Monica	 All right everybody, this turkey is ready!'
Tim	 Where can I wash up?'
Monica	 Here, let me show you. Okay, the towels are hanging next to the sink,\nand umm, you can use the fancy soap.'
Tim	 Thank you.'
Rachel	 Fancy soap? I thought we were savin\xc2\x92 that for the Pope!'
Monica	 See he\xc2\x92s nice. Right?'
Phoebe	 Yeah, but Monica, do you actually want to be in a relationship where you\ncan actually use the phrase, "That\xc2\x92s not how your dad used to do it."'
Tim	 Wow! Everything looks great! Where should I sit?'
Monica	 I saved you a seat. (Motions to the one next to her.)'
Rachel	 (pouring the wine) Sick-sick-sick-sick.'
Phoebe	 Oh, I\xc2\x92ll get it. (goes over to the door.)'
Chandler	 Gotcha! (laughs)'
Joey	 That doesn\xc2\x92t sound like thinking to me!'
Chandler	 Sorry!'
Joey	 Y\xc2\x92know I don\xc2\x92t think you should be talking at all in there! I\nthink you\xc2\x92ve got to much thinking to do to be talking and making jokes!'
Chandler	 Okay, okay, you got it!'
Rachel	 Ross, can you pass me the yams?'
Ross	 Sure! Oh, and Joey\xc2\x92s got the mashed potatoes if you want to exchange\nthem.'
Rachel	 Would you stop?! What is the matter with you?!'
Monica	 Oh-ho-ho, we\xc2\x92ve got company.'
Ross	 There\xc2\x92s nothing the matter with me. See, I\xc2\x92m not completely\ndevoid of sentiment, see I have feelings.'
Rachel	 Okay, fine. (She gets up and walks into her bedroom)'
Chandler	 You can\xc2\x92t tell, but I\xc2\x92m trying to break the tension by\nmooning you guys!'
Joey	 All right, look! If this is just a big joke to you, then forget about it,\nall right?! This means something to me! And if it doesn\xc2\x92t mean anything to you, then\nyou should get out of there, otherwise you\xc2\x92re just an idiot in a box!'
Chandler	 You\xc2\x92re right, and I\xc2\x92m sorry! This means a lot to me! I want\nyou to be my friend again! I swear, I won\xc2\x92t say another word tonight.'
Joey	 So are you gonna start taking this thing seriously?'
Chandler	 Absolutely!'
Joey	 That sounds like another word to me! Are you gonna take this seriously?\n(There\xc2\x92s no response from Chandler.) Okay.'
Rachel	 Don\xc2\x92t say that I have no sentiment! (Starts to show Ross\nwhat\xc2\x92s in the box.) This is a movie stub from our first date! This is an eggshell\nfrom the first time you made me breakfast in bed! (Holds up a bone) This is from the\nmuseum from the first time we\xc2\x85 were together. Okay, maybe I exchange gifts sometimes,\nbut I keep the things that matter! '
Ross	 I don\xc2\x92t know what to say, I\xc2\x92m sorry. Though, you\xc2\x92re not\nsupposed to take these. (Points to the bone) It\xc2\x92s like a million years old, we, we\nactually, we had people looking for that.'
Monica	 (putting off her coat) Ooh, this always happens. (Her coat gets stuck.)'
Tim	 Here, let me help. (Does so.)'
Monica	 Thank you.'
Tim	 You-you have a very beautiful\xc2\x85 eye.'
Monica	 Y\xc2\x92know all my friends think this is weird. '
Tim	 Y\xc2\x92know I-I thought it was gonna be weird, I mean I almost called and\ncanceled, but it really isn\xc2\x92t.'
Monica	 I know! I mean it\xc2\x92s like me and your dad, that\xc2\x92s a totally\nseparate thing.'
Tim	 Oh, I totally agree.'
Monica	 We\xc2\x92re just two people who find each other very attractive. Right?'
Tim	 What?'
Monica	 Nothing. Nothing.'
Tim	 No-no really, was-was that not okay?'
Monica	 No-no-no that was good, it was, that was uh, that was a goood kiss\xc2\x85'
Tim	 Oh my God! It didn\xc2\x92t remind you of\xc2\x85'
Monica	 (interrupting) Don\xc2\x92t say it!'
Tim	 No, but it did! Didn\xc2\x92t it?!'
Monica	 Yeah!'
Tim	 Oh man!!'
Monica	 I know!'
Joey	 I\xc2\x92ll get it. (It\xc2\x92s Kathy.)'
Kathy	 (sees it\xc2\x92s Joey) Oh.'
Joey	 Hey.'
Kathy	 Hey. Listen, I want you to know how sorry I am\xc2\x85'
Joey	 That\xc2\x92s okay. Chandler\xc2\x92s the one I\xc2\x92m mad at.'
Kathy	 Well, I\xc2\x92m still sorry. Is he here?'
Joey	 In the box.'
Kathy	 (going over to the box) Chandler?'
Phoebe	 Oh, he-he can\xc2\x92t talk right now.'
Kathy	 Why not? What\xc2\x92s going on?'
Phoebe	 He\xc2\x92s just trying to show Joey how much he means to him.'
Kathy	 By being in a box?'
Rachel	 Joey, had reasons. '
Phoebe	 They were threefold.'
Kathy	 Oh. Well uh, (to Chandler) you not being able to talk may make\nthis easier. Listen umm\xc2\x85 (She looks at the gang who are watching, they take the hint\nand leave them alone.) Listen I don\xc2\x92t wanna be someone who comes between two best\nfriends. I just, I can\xc2\x92t stand seeing what this is doing to you guys, and I\ndon\xc2\x92t wanna be the cause of that. So, I don\xc2\x92t think we can see each other\nanymore. I\xc2\x92m gonna go to my mom\xc2\x92s in Chicago, I\xc2\x92m gonna stay there for\nawhile. I think this could\xc2\x92ve be something really amazing, but y\xc2\x92know this is\nprobably for the best. Y\xc2\x92know? I\xc2\x92m gonna miss you. Good-bye, Chandler. '
Joey	 (starting to cry) Open the box!! (Runs over to do so.)'
Rachel	 What?!'
Joey	 He can still catch her! Come on, get out of there! (He opens the box) Get\nout of there!'
Chandler	 So?'
Joey	 Yeah, we\xc2\x92re gonna be fine! Get out!'
Chandler	 Yeah?'
Joey	 Yeah, you did some real good thinkin\xc2\x92 in there.'
Chandler	 Man, this is\xc2\x85 '
Joey	 Now go! \xc2\x91Cause you can still catch her! And Merry Christmas from\nyou\xc2\x92re secret Santa! (Chandler runs out and closes the door.) '
Joey	 All right, who got Chandler? \xc2\x91Cause I uh, need to trade.'

Rachel	 Oh, he sees her!'
Monica	 Oh, he\xc2\x92s catching up to her!'
Phoebe	 Oh, she sees him! Oh, they\xc2\x92re hugging!'
Ross	 He\xc2\x92s taking her purse!'
Joey	 Uhh, that\xc2\x92s not them. I\xc2\x92m gonna go call the police.'
Phoebe	 Oh, there they are!'
Phoebe	 All right, get a room.'
