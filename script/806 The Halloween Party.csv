Chandler	 That means nothing to me. (To Ross) Come on!'
Phoebe	 Hi liar!'
Ursula	 Hey!'
Phoebe	 Y\xc2\x92know the only reason he\xc2\x92s marrying you is because he thinks\nall the things you were saying about yourself were true.'
Ursula	 Well they could be true.'
Phoebe	 But they\xc2\x92re not!'
Ursula	 Yeah, it\xc2\x92s a fine line huh?'
Phoebe	 Why are you lying to him?'
Ursula	 I don\xc2\x92t know. He said he did all this stuff and then I said I did\nit too and he got so excited, it was really fun.'
Eric	 (entering) Honey?'
Ursula	 (waving the cigarette in Phoebe\xc2\x92s face) It\xc2\x92s a filthy,\ndisgusting habit and I want you to quit now!'

Joey	 (to her) You\xc2\x92re a weird lady.'
Eric	 (entering) Hey. Ursula said she left her purse.'
Phoebe	 Oh.'
Eric	 (finds it) What a relief. It has all the numbers of the people in her\nprayer chain.'
Phoebe	 Sure it does. Yeah, yeah.'
Eric	 Well, I guess I\xc2\x92ll see you at the wedding. (Exits and Phoebe follows\nhim into the hall.)'
Phoebe	 Umm listen, I don\xc2\x92t think\xc2\x85I don\xc2\x92t think I\xc2\x92m gonna\nmake it to the wedding. So I just want to wish you all the luck in the world.'
Eric	 I think we\xc2\x92ll be okay. Besides it\xc2\x92s so perfect and (whispering)\nshe\xc2\x92s been saving herself for me.'
Phoebe	 Okay I can\xc2\x92t let you do this! She\xc2\x92s lying to you.'
Eric	 What?'
Phoebe	 She is lying! And I bet I can prove it. Excuse me. (She grabs\nUrsula\xc2\x92s purse and starts going through it and finds some papers.) Okay. Okay.\nYeah\xc2\x97Not a prayer chain, but what looks like a detailed drawing of a bank floor plan.\n(Holds up her nametag.) Okay, here\xc2\x92s the nametag from the restaurant where she works\nas a waitress! Not a teacher, a waitress. All right, here\xc2\x92s her driver license, this\noughta be good, she always lies about this. How old did she say she was?'
Eric	 She told me she was 25.'
Phoebe	 Oh, I almost don\xc2\x92t want to show this. (Hands it to him.) Just\nremember I\xc2\x92m a minute younger.'
Eric	 I am so stupid. Of course she was lying! She\xc2\x92s not a teacher.\nThere\xc2\x92s not such a thing as the top secret elementary school for the children of\nspies.'
Phoebe	 No. You\xc2\x92re not, you\xc2\x92re not stupid.'
Eric	 I\xc2\x92m not smart. (Phoebe has no comeback.) I just wanted so much\nto\xc2\x85be impulsive once. To be romantic.'
Phoebe	 That\xc2\x92s good, you should be impulsive and you should be romantic.\nJust\xc2\x85you did it with the wrong person. (He looks at her.) What?'
Eric	 It\xc2\x92s just so weird, two people look so much alike, and so different.'
Ursula	 (yelling from downstairs) Eric!! Let\xc2\x92s go!!'
Eric	 I\xc2\x92d better go, deal\xc2\x85'
Phoebe	 Yeah, you should. (They shake hands.)'
Ursula	 Hurry up I gotta pray!!'
Joey	 Hey!'
Rachel	 Hey! Well, I had to give the kid fifty bucks to stop crying.'
Joey	 That\xc2\x92s not so bad.'
Rachel	 No, I also had to go to a couple houses with him as his girlfriend. Oh,\nI am just awful with children!'
Joey	 Come on! You\xc2\x92re good with kids. They\xc2\x92re just crazy on Halloween.\nY\xc2\x92know, they\xc2\x92re all greedy and hopped up on sugar!'
Rachel	 Really? You think that\xc2\x92s all it is? '
Joey	 Absolutely! Halloween is the worst. Except for Christmas\xc2\x85and their\nbirthdays. Kinda get a little crazy during the summer too. And anytime they\xc2\x92re hungry\nor sleepy. Y\xc2\x92know, kids are tough. Good luck with that. (Walks away.)'

Monica	 Look, I wanted to tell I\xc2\x92m-I\xc2\x92m sorry you lost.'
Chandler	 Listen, I\xc2\x92ve got a secret for ya. I let him win.'
Monica	 (laughs) Is that a secret or a lie.'
Chandler	 No, I let him win\xc2\x97Ross!'
Ross	 Yeah?'
Chandler	 Would you tell her I let you win please?'
Ross	 Oh. Yeah. (Sarcastically) Uh Chandler let me win. No,\nChandler\xc2\x92s really strong. Oh my arm is so sore. Oh nurse! (Waddles over to Mona.)'
Chandler	 I am strong! I\xc2\x92ll show you! (He sits down at the table.)'

Chandler	 Oh what\xc2\x92s the matter? Are you scared?'
Monica	 Let\xc2\x92s go big bunny!'
Chandler	 Okay. 1\xc2\x852\xc2\x853\xc2\x97Go! (Once again he\xc2\x92s at a stalemate,\nbut this time he\xc2\x92s in pain.) (Pause) I\xc2\x92m gonna kill myself!'
