Rachel	 Oh Monica that was the best Thanksgiving dinner ever! I think you\nkilled us.'
Ross	 I couldn't possibly eat another bite. "
Joey	 I need something sweet.'
Phoebe	 Does anyone wanna watch TV?'
All	 Yeah, sure.'
Phoebe	 Monica your remote doesn't work."
Monica	 Phoebe, you have to lift it and point.'
Phoebe	 Oh. Aw, forget it.'
Rachel	 Yeah, you know what we should all do? We should play that game where\neveryone says one thing that they're thankful for."
Joey	 Ooh-ooh, I! I am thankful for this beautiful fall we've been having."
Monica	 That's very nice."
Chandler	 That's sweet, Joey."
Joey	 Yeah, the other day I was at the bus-stop and this lovely fall breeze came\nin out of nowhere and blew this chick's skirt right up. Oh! Which reminds me, I'm also\nthankful for thongs. (Note

Joey	 I mean, it's not so much an underpant as it is a feat of engineering. I\nmean, it's amazing how much they can do with so little material! And the way they play\nwith your mind! Is it there? Is it not there?"
Chandler	 Are you aware that you're still talking?"
Monica	 Is anyone thankful for anything else besides a thong?'
Ross	 Huh, I don't know what to pick. Am I more thankful for my divorce or my\neviction? Hmm."
Phoebe	 Wow! See, and I didn't think you'd be able to come up with anything."
Ross	 I'm sorry. It's just that this is the worse Thanksgiving ever."
Chandler	 No-no-no! I am the king of bad Thanksgivings. You can't just\nswoop in here with your bad marriage and take that away from me."
Rachel	 Oh, you're not gonna tell the whole story about how your parents got\ndivorced again are you?"
Ross	 Oh God, no.'
Joey	 Oh, come on! I wanna hear it! It wouldn't be Thanksgiving without Chandler\nbumming us out!"
Chandler	 It's a tradition, like the parade. If the parade decided it was gay,\nmoved out, and abandoned its entire family."

Mrs. Bing	 Now Chandler dear, just because your father and I are getting a\ndivorce it doesn't mean we don't love you. It just means he would rather sleep with the\nhouse-boy than me."
The Housekeeper	 More turkey Mr. Chandler? (And he makes eyes at him.)'

Ross	 You're right. Yours is worse. You are the king of bad Thanksgivings."
Phoebe	 I don't know about that. I've got one that's worse."
Chandler	 Really? Worse than, "More turkey Mr. Chandler?"'
Phoebe	 Oh, did the little rich boy have a problem with the butler? Yes, mine's\nworse!"


Ross	 In this life, Phoebe.'
Phoebe	 Oh, this life! Oh okay no, Chandler's is worse."
Joey	 Man, it must be so cool remembering stuff like that! I don't have any past\nlife memories."
Phoebe	 Of course you don't sweetie. You're brand new."
Rachel	 I know Monica's worst Thanksgiving."
Monica	 Oh, let's not tell this story."
All	 Oh, come on!'
Phoebe	 Oh no, I know! I know! It's the one where Joey got Monica's turkey stuck\non his head!"
Rachel	 What?! Joey got a turkey stuck on his head?!'
Joey	 Hey, it's not like it sounds."
Chandler	 It's exactly like it sounds."

Joey	 (muffled) Hello?'
Phoebe	 (surprised) Hello?'
Joey	 Phoebe?'
Phoebe	 Joey? What's going on?"
Joey	 Look. (He walks out of the bathroom with his head stuck in a huge turkey.)'
Phoebe	 Oh my God!'
Joey	 I know! It's stuck!!!"
Phoebe	 (walks him to the kitchen) Easy. Step. How did it get on?'
Joey	 I put it on to scare Chandler!'
Phoebe	 Oh my God! Monica's gonna totally freak out!"
Joey	 Well then help me get it off! Plus, it smells really bad in here.'
Phoebe	 Well, of course it smells really bad. You have your head up a dead\nanimal.'
Monica	 (entering) Hey!'
Phoebe	 Hey!'
Monica	 Hey, did you get the turkey basted\xc2\x97Oh my God! Oh my God! (She sees\nsomeone is stuck in the turkey.) Who is that?'
Joey	 It's Joey."
Monica	 What-what are you doing? Is this supposed to be funny?'
Phoebe	 No, it's not supposed to be funny, it's supposed to be scary."
Monica	 Well, get it off now!'
Joey	 I can't! It-it's stuck!"
Monica	 Well, I don't care! That-that turkey has to feed 20 people at my\nparent's house and they're not gonna eat it off your head!"
Phoebe	 All right, hold on! Okay, let's just all think."
Monica	 Okay, I got it. Phoebe? All right, you pull. I'm gonna spread the legs\nas wide as I can. (Joey starts giggling.) Joey? Now is not the time!"
Joey	 Sorry! Sorry.'
Monica	 Okay, count to three. 1. 2. 3!'
Chandler	 Arghhhhhh!! (Joey turns around to taunt him, but Chandler is in the\ndoorway and Joey is facing the kitchen.)'
Joey	 (pointing) It worked! I scared ya, I knew it! Ha-ha!'
Chandler	 I'm over here big guy."
Joey	 (turning all the way around, and still not facing Chandler) Yeah, you are!\n(Starts dancing.) I scared you!'

Chandler	 (laughing) You did look like an idiot.'
Joey	 Hey, I wasn\'t the only one who looked like an idiot. All right? Remember\nwhen Ross tried to say, "Butternut squash?" And it came out, "Squatternut\nbuash?"'
Ross	 Yeah that's the same."
Monica	 That's it. That's my worse Thanksgiving."
Phoebe	 Oh wait! That can't be the one Rachel's talking about. She didn't even\nknow that happened. So which one was it?"
All	 Which one?'
Monica	 Umm, I-I really don't want to tell this story."
Chandler	 Oh, come on Monica, reliving past pain and getting depressed is what\nThanksgiving is all about. Y'know, for me anyway. And of course, the Indians."
Monica	 Look umm, of all people, you do not want me to tell this story!'

Mrs. Geller	 Monica! I think Rachel's here!"
Monica	 I'll get it! (She runs in, and she's her old fat self like The One With\nThe Prom Video. Not only that, she's out of breath after running a short distance. She\ngoes over and opens the door to reveal Rachel with her old nose.) Happy Thanksgiving!"
Big Nosed Rachel	 Not for me. Chip and I broke up!'
Fat Monica	 Oh, why? Why? What happened?'
Big Nosed Rachel	 Well, you know that my parents are out of town and Chip was\ngoing to come over\xc2\x85'
Fat Monica	 Yeah, yeah, and you were going him y'know, your flower."
Big Nosed Rachel	 Okay, Monica, can you just call it sex?! It really\ncreeps me out when you call it that! Okay, and by the way, while we're at it, a guy's\nthing is not called his tenderness. Believe me! (Walks into the living room and greets\nMonica's parents.) Hi!"
Mr. Geller	 Hi Rachel!'
Big Nosed Rachel	 Happy Thanksgiving!'
Mrs. Geller	 You too sweethart!'
Ross	 (entering) Hey! '
Mr. Geller	 Oh my!'
Ross	 Uh, everyone, this is Chandler! My roommate and lead singer of our band!'
Fat Monica	 Ross! (Wanting to be introduced.)'
Ross	 Oh, this is Monica.'
Fat Monica	 Hi, I'm Ross's little sister."
Chandler	 (seeing her) Okay.'
Mrs. Geller	 I'm so glad you could come Chandler, we've got plenty of food so I\nhope you're hungry."
Ross	 Oh, mom. Mom. Chandler hates Thanksgiving and doesn't eat any Thanksgiving\nfood."
Mrs. Geller	 Oh, well, I'm so glad you brought him here then."
Fat Monica	 Umm, Chandler, if you want I can make you some macaroni and cheese\nfor dinner.'
Chandler	 Well, as long as the pilgrims didn't eat it, I'm in."
Fat Monica	 dammit! (Runs off.)'
Ross	 So uh, Rach? Does it, does it feel weird around here now? Y'know since\nI've been away at college."
Big Nosed Rachel	 Oh! No, not really.'
Ross	 Well, that's cool. So did\xc2\x85 (She walks away from him and he shuts up.)"
Big Nosed Rachel	 Ugh! I cannot believe Chip dumped me for that slut\nNancy Branson. I am never going out with him again. I don't care how much he begs!"
Fat Monica	 I think his begging days are over now that he's going out with Nancy\nBranson."
Big Nosed Rachel	 Y'know what? I've just had it with high school boys! They are\njust silly. (Ross is overhearing this.) Silly, stupid boys! I'm going to start dating men!"
Ross	 Umm, I'm sorry Judy, I couldn't find that bowl that you and Jack were\nlooking for."
Fat Monica	 Call them mom and dad you loser!'
Ross	 (in a high pitched voice) Monica!'
Fat Monica	 Hey Chandler! Did you like the macaroni and cheese?'
Chandler	 Oh yeah, it was great. You should be a chef.'
Fat Monica	 Okay!'
Big Nosed Rachel	 Guess what?! All that stuff about Nancy Branson being a slut\nwas all a rumor so Chip dumped her and he wants to come over to my house tonight!'
Fat Monica	 Oh that's so great!"
Big Nosed Rachel	 I know!'
Fat Monica	 Oh gosh, listen if you and Chip do it tonight, promise me you'll\ntell me everything."
Big Nosed Rachel	 Oh totally, totally. Y'know it's not that big of deal, we\nalready kinda did it once y'know."
Fat Monica	 I know, but y'know, this time you're gonna definitely know\nwhether or not you did it!"
Big Nosed Rachel	 I know, I know. And oh, and this time Chip promised\nthat-that this time it will last at least for an entire song!'
Ross	 So I\xc2\x92m thinking about asking Rachel out tonight. Y'know maybe play\nher that song we wrote last week."
Chandler	 Emotional Knapsack?'
Ross	 Yeah.'
Chandler	 Right on! Oh! Uh, but, don\xc2\x92t take to long okay? 'Cause uh, we're\ngonna test out our fake ID's tonight, right Clifford Alverez."
Ross	 Listen, Roland Chang, if things go well, I\xc2\x92m gonna be out with her\nall night.'
Chandler	 Dude, don't do that too me!"
Ross	 All right, it's cool you can stay here. My parents won't mind."
Chandler	 No, it's not that, I just don't want to be stuck here all night with\nyour fat sister."
Ross	 Hey!'
Mrs. Geller	 (holding two pies) Monica, why don't you finish off these pies? I\ndon't have any more room left in the fridge."
Fat Monica	 No. No, thank you!'
Mr. Geller	 Well Judy, you did it! She's finally full!"

Chandler	 I called you fat?! I don't even remember that!"
Monica	 Well, I do.'
Chandler	 I am so sorry. I really am. I was an idiot back then. I rushed the\nstage at a Wham concert for crying out loud!'
Phoebe	 Oh, I can't believe you called her fat."
Ross	 I can't believe you let George Michael slap you."
Chandler	 I am really sorry. That is so terrible. I am so, so sorry.'
Rachel	 Actually, y'know that's not the Thanksgiving I was talking about."
Monica	 Yes, it was!'
Rachel	 No, it wasn't. It was actually the\xc2\x85"
Monica	 (interrupting her) Okay, now Thanksgiving's over, let's get ready for\nChristmas. Who wants to go get a Christmas tree?!"
Phoebe	 Oh, no, I have the cutest Christmas story!'
Chandler	 We wanna hear Monica's Thanksgiving story!"
Phoebe	 Fine, all right, mine had a dwarf that got broke in half, but y'know\nwhatever."

Mrs. Geller	 So Rachel, your mom tells me you changed your major again.'
Rachel	 Oh, yeah, I had too. There was never any parking by the Psychology\nbuilding.'
Mr. Geller	 (entering) Hi Rachel.'
Rachel	 Oh hi!'
Mr. Geller	 Wow, love your new nose!'
Mrs. Geller	 Jack.'
Mr. Geller	 What? Dr. Wilson's an artist! He removed my mole cluster. Wanna see?\n(He starts to show her as the doorbell rings.)"
Mrs. Geller	 I'll get it."
Rachel	 No, God! Please, let me! (Runs out.)'
Rachel	 Hey!'
Ross	 Hey. (To his parents) Happy Thanksgiving! '
Mr. Geller	 (To Chandler) God, your hair sure is different!'
Chandler	 Yeah, we were just talking about that. I can't believe how stupid we\nused to look. (They both quickly push their sleeves over their elbows.)"
Ross	 So uh, where's Monica?"
Mrs. Geller	 She's upstairs. Monica! Come down! Everyone's here! Ross, Rachel,\nand the boy who hates Thanksgiving."
Monica	 Hi, Chandler.'
Chandler	 Oh my God!'
Monica	 What-what's the matter? Is there, is there something on my dress? (She\nturns around making sure he gets a good look.)"
Chandler	 You just, you look so different! Terrific! That dress! That body!'
Ross	 Dude!'
Chandler	 Sorry!'
Mrs. Geller	 Yes, yes Monica is thin. It's wonderful. But what we really want to\nhear about is Ross's new girlfriend."
Ross	 Oh mom! Okay, umm, her name is Carol. And she's really pretty. And smart.\nAnd uh, she's-she's on the lacrosse team and the golf team. Can you believe it? She plays\nfor both teams!"
Monica	 So Chandler, I guess I'll see you at dinner."
Mr. Geller	 Dude!'
Chandler	 Sorry.'
Rachel	 (entering) Oh-ho, my God! That was so awesome! You totally got him back\nfor calling you fat! He was just drooling all over you. That must've felt so great!"
Monica	 Well it didn't!"
Rachel	 What?!'
Monica	 Yeah, I mean yeah, I look great. Yeah, I feel great and yeah, my heart\nis not in trouble anymore! Blah, blah, blah! Y'know I still don't feel like I got him\nback, y'know? I just want to humiliate him. I wanna, I want him to be like naked and then\nI'm going to point at him and laugh!"
Rachel	 Okay, that we may be able to do.'
Monica	 How?'
Rachel	 Well guys tend to get naked before they're gonna have sex."
Monica	 What?! I mean, I didn't work this hard and-and-and lose all this weight\nso that I can give my flower to someone like him!"
Rachel	 Okay, first of all, if you keep calling it that, no one's gonna ever\ntake it. Then, second of all you're not actually gonna have sex with him! You're just\ngonna make him think that you are."
Monica	 Yeah.'
Rachel	 Yeah.'
Monica	 And when he's naked I can throw him out in the front yard and lock the\ndoor and all the neighbors will just humiliate him!"
Rachel	 Then, you will definitely get him back!'
Monica	 Okay, so how do I make him think I wanna have sex with him?'
Rachel	 Okay, oh, here's what you do. Just act like everything around you turns\nyou on."
Monica	 What do you mean?'
Rachel	 Well, like anything can be sexy. Like umm, oh-oh, like this dishtowel!\n(She grabs it and starts rubbing it on her cheek.) Ooh, ooh, this feels sooo good against\nmy cheek! And-and if I feel a little hot, I can just dab myself with it. Or I can bring it\ndown to my side and bring it through my fingers while I talk to him.'
Monica	 (excited) I can do that!'
Rachel	 Yeah? Okay! Good, good, because he's coming. He's coming. (To Chandler)\nHey, what's up? (She leaves and closes the door behind her.)"
Chandler	 Monica, I was wondering if you can make me some of that righteous mac\nand cheese like last year.'
Monica	 Umm, I'd love too! (She goes over and picks up the box and decides to\nfollow Rachel's advice and holds the box up to her cheek.) Ooh, I love macaroni and\ncheese. I love-I love the way this box feels against my cheek."
Chandler	 Okay.'
Monica	 Boy, I love carrots! Oh! (She picks up a bunch of them and holds them\nbetween her fingers.) Sometimes I like to put them between my fingers like this and-and\nhold them down here while I talk to you. (She is rubbing her hip with the carrots.) Umm,\nand-and-and y'know if I get really hot umm, I-I like to pick up this knife (She picks up a\nknife without putting the box down. She's holding the box between her cheek and shoulder)\nand-and umm, I-I put the cold steal against umm, (Pause) my body. (She doesn't have any\nexposed skin within reach of the knife, so while holding the carrots in one hand and the\nbox between her face and shoulder, she rubs the knife on her stomach.)"
Chandler	 Are you all right?'
Monica	 Oh yeah, of course. I'm fine it's just that\xc2\x97(She drops the box and\nin a reflex action tries to catch it with her arm, the knife slips out and slowly flips\nthrough the air and comes point first down into Chandler's shoe.)"
The Doctor	 What do we got here?'
The Paramedic	 Twenty year old has got a severed toe on his right foot.'
Ross	 Can you please not do that feet first? You know where his injury is!\nSevered toe, you just said it!'
The Doctor	 It says here that the knife went right through your shoe.'
Mr. Geller	 Of course it did. They're made of wicker."
The Doctor	 Did you bring the toe?'
Monica	 Oh yes! I have it right here, on ice! (She takes a bag of ice out of her\npurse and hands it to the doctor.)'
The Doctor	 (opening it) Don't worry son, we'll just attach it and\xc2\x97(Stops\nsuddenly.)"
Monica	 What?! What is it?'
The Doctor	 You brought a carrot.'
Chandler	 What?'
The Doctor	 This isn't your toe, this is a small, very cold piece of carrot."
Rachel	 You brought a carrot?!'
Mrs. Geller	 Oh my God! There's a toe in my kitchen."
Monica	 God, I'm sorry! I'll go back and get it!"
The Doctor	 It's too late, all we can do now is sow up the wound."
Chandler	 Without my toe?! I need my toe!'
Monica	 Wait, no-no-no, I can go really fast! Dad, give me the keys to your Porsche!'
Mr. Geller	 Oh, I'm not falling for that one!"

Chandler	 That's why I lost my toe?! Because I called you fat?!"
Monica	 I didn't mean to cut it off. It was an accident."
Chandler	 That's why for an entire year people called me Sir Limps-A-Lot?!"
Monica	 I'm sorry! It wasn't your whole toe!"
Chandler	 Yeah, well, I miss the tip! It's the best part. It has the nail. (He\nstorms out.)"
Monica	 Chandler! (Follows him out.)'
Ross	 (To Joey) Sir Limps-A-Lot, I came up with that.'
Joey	 You're a dork."
Chandler	 I can't believe this."
Monica	 Chandler, I said I was sorry.'
Chandler	 Yeah, well, sorry doesn\xc2\x92t bring back the little piggy that cried\nall the way home! I hate this stupid day! And everything about it! I'll see you\nlater."
Monica	 Oh wait, Chandler, come here is there anything I can do? Anything?'
Chandler	 Yeah, just leave me alone for a while. (He goes into his apartment.)'
Chandler	 Oh-oh, I\'m a duck! I go, "Quack, quack!" I\xc2\x92m happy all\nthe time!'
Chandler	 Nice try.'
Monica	 Wait, wait, wait! (She puts a Shriner's hat on the turkey.)"
Chandler	 Look, Monica\xc2\x85'
Monica	 Look! (She puts a big, yellow pair of sunglasses on the bird.)'
Chandler	 This is not going to work.'
Monica	 I bet this will work! (She starts dancing and Chandler cracks up.)'
Chandler	 You are so great! I love you!'
Monica	 What?'
Chandler	 Nothing! I said, I said "You\'re so great" and then I just, I\njust stopped talking!'
Monica	 You said you loved me! I can't believe this!"
Chandler	 No I didn't!"
Monica	 Yes, you did!'
Chandler	 No I didn't!"
Monica	 You love me!'
Chandler	 No I don't! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!"
