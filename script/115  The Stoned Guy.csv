Rachel	 (to Joey) Coffee. (Hands it to him.)'
Joey	 Thank you.'
Rachel	 (to Ross) Cappuccino. (Hands it to him.) '
Ross	 Grazie.'
Rachel	 And a nice hot cider for Monica. (Hands it to her.)'
Monica	 Aww, thank you. (Notices something.) Uh Rach?'
Rachel	 Yeah?'
Monica	 Why does my cinamon stick have an eraser?'
Rachel	 Oh! That's why. (Rachel checks behind her ear, and finds a cinamon\nstick.) I'm sorry!"
Woman	 Chandler.'
Chandler	 Mrs. Tedlock. You're looking lovely today. And may I say, that is a very\nflattering sleeve length on you."
Mrs. Tedlock	 Yes. Well, Mr. Kostelick wants you to stop by his office at the\nend of the day.'
Chandler	 Oh, listen. If this is about those prank memos, I had nothing to do\nwith them. Really. Nothing at all. Really. (Chandler tries to hide a rubber chicken from\nthe woman.) Nothing.'
Phoebe	 Hey you guys! Chandler's coming and he says he has, like, this\nincredible news, so when he gets here, we could all act like, you know..."
Chandler	 Hey!'
All	 Hey!'
Phoebe	 Never mind. But it was going to be really good.'
Ross	 What's going on?"
All	 What is it?'
Chandler	 So, it's a typical day at work. I'm inputting my numbers, and big Al\ncalls me into his office and tells me he wants to make me processing supervisor."
All	 That's great!"
Chandler	 So.... I quit.'
All	 Why?'
Chandler	 Why? This was supposed to be a temp job!'
Monica	 Yeah, Chandler... you've been there for five years."
Chandler	 If I took this promotion, it'd be like admitting that this is what I\nactually do."
Phoebe	 So was it a lot more money?'
Chandler	 It doesn't matter. I just don't want to be one of those guys that's in\nhis office until twelve o'clock at night worrying about the WENUS."
Rachel	 ... the WENUS?'
Chandler	 Weekly Estimated Net Usage Systems. A processing term.'
Rachel	 (sarcastic) Oh. That WENUS.'
Joey	 So what're you going to do?"
Chandler	 I don't know. That's the thing. I don't know what I want to do. I just\nknow I'm not going to figure it out working there."
Phoebe	 Oooh! I have something you can do! I have this new massage client...\nSteve? (pause) Anyway, he's opening up a restaurant and he's looking for a head chef."
Monica	 (taps Phoebe on her shoulder) Um... hi there.'
Phoebe	 Hi! (turns back to Chandler, then to Monica) Oh, yeah, no, I know.\nYou're a chef. I know, and I thought of you first, but um, Chandler's the one who needs a\njob right now, so...."
Chandler	 Yeah... I just don't have that much cheffing experience. Unless it's\nan all-toast restaurant."
Phoebe	 (to Monica's tapping) Yeah, yeah! "
Monica	 Well, what kind of food is he looking for?'
Phoebe	 Well, he wants to do some ecclectic, so he's looking for someone who\ncan, you know, create the entire menu."
Monica	 (excited) Oh my God!'
Phoebe	 Yeah, I know! (turns to Chandler) So, what do you think?'
Chandler	 Thanks, Phoebe. But I just don't really see myself in a big white hat."
Phoebe	 OK. (pause) Oh Monica! Guess what!'
Chandler	 Can you see my nipples through this shirt?'
Rachel	 No. But don't worry, I'm sure they're still there."
Phoebe	 Where are you going, Mr. Suity-Man?'
Chandler	 Well, I have an appointment to see Dr. Robert Pillman, career\ncounselor a-gogo. (pause) I added the "a-gogo."'
Rachel	 Career counselor?'
Chandler	 Hey, you guys all know what you want to do.'
Rachel	 I don't!"
Chandler	 Hey, you guys in the living room all know what you want to do.\nYou know, you have goals. You have dreams. I don't have a dream."
Ross	 Ah, the lesser-known "I don\'t have a dream" speech.'
Monica	 Oh, I love my life, I love my life!'
Phoebe	 Ooh! Brian's Song!"
Rachel	 The meeting with the guy went great?'
Monica	 So great! He showed me where the restaurant's going to be. It's this,\nit's this cute little place on 10th Street. Not too big, not too small. Just right."
Chandler	 Was it formerly owned by a blonde woman and some bears?'
Monica	 So anyway, I'm cooking dinner for him Monday night. You know, kind of\nlike an audition. And Phoebe, he really wants you to be here, which will be great for me\nbecause then you can 'ooh' and 'ahh' and make yummy noises."
Rachel	 What are you going to make?'
Phoebe	 (as though Rachel wasn't paying attention) Yummy noises."
Rachel	 (pause) And Monica, what are you going to make?'
Monica	 I don't know. I don't know. It's just going to be so great!"
Phoebe	 Ooh! I know what you could make! (runs over to join Monica and Rachel in\nthe kitchen) I know! Oh, you should definitely make that thing... you know, with the\nstuff? (Monica doesn't know.) You know, that thing... with the stuff...? OK, I don't know.\n(sits down)"
Ross	 Hey guys, does anybody know a good date place in the neighborhood?'
Joey	 How about Tony's? If you can finish a 32-ounce steak, it's free."
Ross	 OK, ahem, hey, does anybody know a good place if you're not dating a puma?"
Chandler	 Who are you going out with?'
Phoebe	 Oh, is this the bug lady?'
Rachel	 (trying to sound like a bug) Bzzzz.... I love you, Ross.'
Ross	 Her name is Celia. She's not a bug lady. She's curator of insects at the\nmuseum."
Rachel	 So what are you guys going to do?'
Ross	 Oh, I just thought we could go out to dinner, and then maybe bring her\nback to my place and I'd introduce her to my monkey."
Chandler	 And he's not speaking metaphorically."
Joey	 (aside to Ross) So.... back to your place...you thinking, maybe...\n(gestures with hands, back and forth) huh-huh?'
Ross	 Well, I don't know.... (gestures) huh-huh.... but I'm hoping (gestures)\nhuh-huh."
Joey	 I'm telling you, that monkey is a chick magnet! She's going to take one\nlook at his furry, cute little face and it'll seal the deal."
Ross	 Celia, don't worry!\xc2\xa0 Don't scream!\xc2\xa0 He's not going to hurt you!\nSoothing tones, Celia. Soothing tones! Marcel..."
Celia	 I can't stand this! He's got his claws in my..."
Ross	 Alright... (lifts Marcel away)'
Monica	 (to Joey) OK, try this salmon mousse.'
Joey	 (tasting) Mmmm. Good.'
Monica	 Is it better than the other salmon mousse?'
Joey	 It's creamier."
Monica	 Yeah, well, is that better?'
Joey	 I don't know. We're talking about whipped fish, Monica. I'm just happy I'm\nkeeping it down, y'know?"
Rachel	 My God! What happened to you?'
Chandler	 Eight and a half hours of aptitude tests, intelligence tests,\npersonality tests... and what do I learn? (he taps the results and reads them) "You\nare ideally suited for a career in data processing for a large multinational\ncorporation."'
Phoebe	 That's so great! 'Cause you already know how to do that!"
Chandler	 Can you believe it? I mean, don't I seem like somebody who should be\ndoing something really cool? You know, I just always pictured myself doing\nsomething...something."
Rachel	 (comes up and rubs him on the chest) Oh Chandler, I know, I know... oh,\nhey! You can see your nipples through this shirt!'
Monica	 (brings a plate of tiny appetizers over) Here you go, maybe this'll\ncheer you up."
Chandler	 Ooh, you know, I had a grape about five hours ago, so I'd better split\nthis with you."
Monica	 It's supposed to be that small. It's a pre-appetizer. The French call it\nan amouz-bouche. "
Chandler	 (tastes it) Well.... it is amouz-ing...'
Monica	 (on phone) Hello? (Listens) Oh, hi Wendy! (Listens) Yeah, eight o'clock.\n(Listens) What did we say? Ten dollars an hour?... (Listens) OK, great. (Listens) All\nright, I'll see you then. Bye. (hangs up)"
Phoebe	 Ten dollars an hour for what?'
Monica	 Oh, I asked one of the waitresses at work if she'd help me out."
Rachel	 (hurt) Waitressing?'
Joey	 Uh-oh.'
Monica	 Well... of course I thought of you! But... but...'
Rachel	 But, but?'
Monica	 But, you see, it's just... this night has to go just perfect, you know?\nAnd, well, Wendy's more of a... professional waitress."
Rachel	 Oh! I see. And I've sort of been maintaining my amateur status so that I\ncan waitress in the Olympics."
Chandler	 You know, I don't mean to brag, but I waited tables at Innsbruck in\n'76. (dead silence) Amouz-bouche? (holds out tray)"
Celia	 Talk to me.'
Ross	 OK.... um, a weird thing happened to me on the train this morning...'
Celia	 No no no. Talk... dirty.'
Ross	 (embarrassed) Wha... what, here?'
Celia	 Yes...'
Ross	 Ah....'
Celia	 Say something..... hot.'
Ross	 (panicked) Er.... um..... '
Celia	 What?'
Ross	 Um... uh.... vulva.'
Joey	 (in disbelief) Vulva?'
Ross	 Alright, I panicked, alright? She took me by surprise. You know, but it\nwasn't a total loss. I mean, we ended up cuddling."
Joey	 (sarcastic) Whoaa!! You cuddled? How many times??'
Ross	 Shut up! It was nice. I just... I don't think I'm the dirty-talking kind\nof guy, you know?"
Joey	 What's the big deal? You just say what you want to do to her. Or what you\nwant her to do to you. Or what you think other people might be doing to each other. I'll\ntell you what. Just try something on me."
Ross	 (deadpan) Please be kidding.'
Joey	 Why not? Come on! Just, just close your eyes and tell me what you'd like\nto be doing right now."
Ross	 OK. (closes eyes) I'm in my apartment..."
Joey	 ....yeah... what else?'
Ross	 That's it. I'm in my apartment, you're not there, we're not having this\nconversation. (gets up, walks across room)"
Joey	 (walks to catch up to him) Alright, look, I'll start, OK?"
Ross	 Joey, please.'
Joey	 Come on. Come on. Alright, ready, look! (in a low voice) Oh... Ross....\nyou get me so hot. I want your lips on me now.'
Ross	 (impressed) Wow.'
Joey	 Alright, now you say something.'
Ross	 I... ahem... I really don't think so."
Joey	 Come on! You like this woman, right?'
Ross	 Yeah.'
Joey	 You want to see her again, right?'
Ross	 Sure.'
Joey	 Well if you can't talk dirty to me, how're you going to talk dirty to her?\nNow tell me you want to caress my butt!"
Ross	 OK, turn around. (Joey looks taken aback) I just don't want you staring at\nme when I'm doing this."
Joey	 (turning around) Alright, alright. I'm around. Go ahead."
Ross	 Ahem... I want.... OK, I want to... feel your... hot, soft skin with my\nlips.'
Joey	 There you go! Keep going. Keep going!'
Ross	 I, er...'
Ross	 I want to take my tongue... and... '
Ross	 ....and....'
Joey	 Say it... say it!'
Ross	 ...run it all over your body until you're... trembling with... with..."
Chandler	 (smiling)....with??'
Ross	 (rushing to explain) Funny story!'
Joey	 You're not going to believe this!"
Chandler	 It's OK. It's OK. I was always rooting for you two kids to get\ntogether."
Joey	 Hey Chandler, while you were sleeping that guy from your old job called\nagain.'
Chandler	 Again?'
Joey	 And again, and again, and again... (phone rings, he answers) Hello? (hands\nphone to Chandler) And again.'
Chandler	 (on phone) Hey Mr. Kostelic! How's life on the fifteenth floor?\n(Listens) Yeah, I miss you too. (Listens) Yeah, it's a lot less satisfying to steal pens\nfrom your own home, you know? (Listens) Well, that's very generous (Listens) er, but look,\nthis isn't about the money. I need something that's more than a job. I need something I\ncan really care about.... (Listens) And that's on top of the yearly bonus structure you\nmentioned earlier? (Listens) Look, Al, Al... I'm not playing hardball here, OK? This is\nnot a negotiation, this is a rejection! (Listens) No! No! No, stop saying numbers! I'm\ntelling you, you've got the wrong guy! You've got the wrong guy! (Listens) I'll see you on\nMonday! (slams the phone down)"
Chandler	 Well?'
Phoebe	 (excited) Wow! It's huge! It's so much bigger than the cubicle. Oh, this\nis a cube."
Chandler	 Look at this! (he opens the curtain to a view of New York City)'
Phoebe	 Oh! You have a window!'
Chandler	 Yes indeedy! (they look outside) With a beautiful view of...'
Phoebe	 Oh look! That guy's peeing!"
Chandler	 (walks away from window) OK, that's enough of the view. Check this\nout, look at this. Sit down, sit down."
Phoebe	 (sitting) OK.'
Chandler	 This is great! (he presses a button on his intercom) Helen, could you\ncome in here for a moment? '
Chandler	 Thank you Helen, that'll be all."
Chandler	 Last time I do that, I promise.'
Monica	 (shouting on phone) Wendy, we had a deal! (Listens) Yeah, you promised!\nWendy! Wendy! Wendy! (hangs up)'
Rachel	 Who was that?'
Monica	 Wendy bailed. I have no waitress.'
Rachel	 Oh... that's too bad. Bye bye. (she walks away towards the door)"
Monica	 Ten dollars an hour.'
Rachel	 No.'
Monica	 Twelve dollars an hour.'
Rachel	 Mon. I wish I could, but I've made plans to walk around."
Monica	 You know, Rachel, when you ran out of your wedding, I was there for you.\nI put a roof over your head, and if that means nothing to you... (Rachel isn't buying it,\ndesperate) twenty dollars an hour."
Rachel	 Done.'
Rachel	 Well hello! Welcome to Monica's. May I take your coat?"
Monica	 Hi Steve!'
Steve	 Hello, Monica. (to Rachel) Hello, greeter girl.'
Monica	 (to Steve) This is Rachel.'
Steve	 (unconcerned) Yeah, OK.'
Phoebe	 (overemphasizing) Mmmmmm! Everything smells so delicious! You know, I\ncan't remember a time I smelt such a delicious combination of (Monica signals her to stop)\nof, OK, smells."
Steve	 It's a lovely apartment."
Monica	 Oh, thank you. Would you like a tour?'
Steve	 I was just being polite, but, alright. '
Rachel	 What's up?"
Phoebe	 (whispers) In the cab, on the way over, Steve blazed up a doobie.'
Rachel	 What?'
Phoebe	 Smoked a joint? You know, lit a bone? Weed? Hemp? Ganja?'
Rachel	 OK, OK. I'm with you, Cheech. OK."
Steve	 (from the living room) Is it dry in here? (licks his lips)'
Rachel	 Let me, let me get you some wine!'
Monica	 Yeah, I think we're ready for our first course. (Steve sits, Monica\nbrings over a tray) OK, um, these are rot-shrimp ravioli, and celantro pondou sauce...\n(Steve starts to eat them one by one, quickly)... with just a touch of mints... and... (he\nfinishes)... ginger."
Steve	 Well, smack my ass and call me Judy! These are fantastic!'
Monica	 I'm so glad you liked them!"
Steve	 Like 'em? I could eat a hundred of them!"
Monica	 Oh, well... um, that's all there are of these. But in about eight and a\nhalf minutes, we'll be serving some delicious onion tartlets."
Steve	 Tartlets. Tartlets. Tartlets. The word has lost all meaning. (he gets up\nand goes into the kitchen)'
Rachel	 Excuse me? Can I help you with anything?'
Steve	 You know, I don't know what I'm looking for. "
Steve	 (from kitchen) Ah, cool! Taco shells! (Rachel motions, "You\nsee!") You know, these are... they\'re like a little corn envelope.'
Monica	 (joining him and taking the taco shells) You know that? You don't want\nto spoil your appetite."
Steve	 (looking in cabinets) Hey! Sugar-O's! (grabs the cereal box)"
Monica	 You know, if you just wait another... six and a half minutes...'
Steve	 Macaroni and cheese! We gotta make this!'
Monica	 No, we don't. (reaches for box) "
Steve	 Oh, OK. (he drops the box on the floor) Oh, sorry. (When she bends down\nto pick it up he grabs a package of Gummi-bears from the cabinet.) '
Monica	 Why don't you just have a seat here? (he sits at the table, then tries\nto secretly eat the Gummi-bears. Monica spots him.) OK... give me the Gummi-bears."
Steve	 (childishly) No.'
Monica	 Give them to me.'
Steve	 Alright, we'll share."
Monica	 No, give me the...'
Steve	 Well then you can\'t have any. (she grabs for the package, and it breaks\nopen. Gummi-bears fly everywhere, some into the punch bowl on the table.) Bear overboard!\nI think he\'s drowning. (he throws some Sugar-O\'s into the punch bowl) Hey fellows! Grab on\na Sugar-O... save yourself! (Mimicking the bears) "Help!\xc2\xa0 I\'m drowning! \xc2\xa0\nHelp!"'
Monica	 (furious) That's it! Dinner is over!"
Steve	 What?'
Monica	 What?'
Steve	 Why?'
Monica	 Why? It's just that I've waited seven years for an opportunity like\nthis, and you can't even wait four and a half minutes for a stupid onion tartlet?"
Steve	 (excited) Hey!'
Joey	 What a tool!'
Rachel	 You don't want to work for a guy like that."
Ross	 Yeah!'
Monica	 I know... it's just... I thought this was, you know... it."
Ross	 Look, you'll get there. You're an amazing chef."
Phoebe	 Yeah! You know all those yummy noises? I wasn't faking."
Joey	 (to Ross) So, er... how did it go with Celia?'
Ross	 Oh, I was unbelievable.'
Joey	 All right, Ross!'
Ross	 I was the James Michener of dirty talk. It was the most elaborate filth\nyou have ever heard. I mean, there were characters, plot lines, themes, a motif...\nat one point there were villagers.'
Joey	 Whoa! And the... (gestures with hands) huh-huh?'
Ross	 Well, ahem... you know, by the time we'd finished with all the dirty talk,\nit was kinda late... and we were both kind of exhausted, so uh..."
Joey	 You cuddled.'
Ross	 Yeah, which was nice.'
Phoebe	 You guys wanna try and catch a late movie or something?'
Rachel	 Maybe, but shouldn't we wait for Chandler?"
Joey	 Yeah, where the hell is he?'
Chandler	 (on phone) Yes, Fran. I know what time it is, but I'm looking at the\nWENUS and I'm not happy!... (Listens) Oh, really, really, really? Well, let me tell you\nsomething... you will care about it, because I care about it! You got it? Good! (slams\nphone down, then leans back and realizes what just happened) Whooooaaaa...."
Phoebe	 How's this? (presses down hard)"
Steve	 Eeeee!'
Phoebe	 Sorry. How about over here? (presses down hard again)'
Steve	 Aaaaah!'
Phoebe	 See, that just means it's working. Does this hurt? (presses down\nelsewhere)"
Steve	 No.'
Phoebe	 What about this? (she starts using her elbows on his back, he yells in\npain)'
Steve	 Aaaaahhh!!'
Phoebe	 There you go! (She continues to work him over\nwith her elbows and he continues to yell in pain.)'
