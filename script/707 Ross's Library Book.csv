Joey	 Morning!'
Rachel	 Hi! Oh, how was your date last night?'
Joey	 Pretty good.'
Rachel	 Oh good. (She walks to the closed bathroom door, opens it, and finds a\nnaked woman wrapped in a towel.) Ahhh! My God, sorry! (She closes the door and confronts\nJoey.)'
Joey	 Okay, really good. Anyway I gotta go; I\xc2\x92m late for work.'
Rachel	 What-what?! You\xc2\x92re gonna leave this person with me?!'
Joey	 Yeah\xc2\x97Hey, don\xc2\x92t worry, she\xc2\x92s a terrific girl. And hey\nlisten, could you do me a favor? When she comes out could you just mention that I\xc2\x92m\nnot looking for a serious relationship; that\xc2\x92d be great.'
Rachel	 Why?! What?! Are you kidding?!'
Joey	 Just casually slip it in, y\xc2\x92know lay the groundwork. Tell her uh,\nI\xc2\x92m a loner\xc2\x97No! An outlaw! Tell her she doesn\xc2\x92t want to get mixed up with\nthe likes of me.'
Rachel	 Y\xc2\x92know what? That\xc2\x92s a lot to remember, can\xc2\x92t I just tell\nher you\xc2\x92re a pig?'
Joey	 Hey, I\xc2\x92m gonna call her later! Honest! Oh come on, Chandler used to\ndo it! He\xc2\x92d even make the girl pancakes! Plus, he\xc2\x92d make extras and leave\n\xc2\x91em for me.'
Rachel	 Well forget it, I\xc2\x92m not telling that girl anything. That is not my\nresponsibility.'
Joey	 Fine! (Pause) Now, where\xc2\x92d we land on those pancakes? (She chases him\nout the door as his date emerges from the bathroom.)'
Rachel	 Hi.'
Rachel	 Yeah, Joey kinda disabled it when I moved in.'
Rachel	 Hi.'
Erin	 Hi. I don\xc2\x92t mean this to sound like high school, but did he say\nanything about me?'
Rachel	 (pause) Would you like some pancakes?'

Chandler	 \xc2\x85Come on! Why are we here?!'
Ross	 Okay, okay take a guess.'
Chandler	 The hot chicks?'
Ross	 Okay, okay, I was typing names into the library computer earlier,\ny\xc2\x92know-y\xc2\x92know for fun, and I typed mine in and guess what came up? My doctoral\ndissertation! It\xc2\x92s here! Yeah, it\xc2\x92s right-it\xc2\x92s right down here! In the\nbiggest library in the university! (They start heading that way, towards a secluded\nsection behind the racks.)'
Chandler	 Wow that\xc2\x92s actually pretty cool.'
Ross	 (stopping quickly) Oh umm, there\xc2\x92s also a book here by a woman named\nWendy Bagina. (They both laugh, but stop when the hear moaning coming from the next\naisle.) What is that?'
Chandler	 Sounds like two people are really enjoying the Dewey decimal system.'
Female Student	 (as they are moving past Ross) I\xc2\x92m so sorry!'
Male Student	 Sorry!'
Chandler	 You didn\xc2\x92t bring me here to do that, did you?'
Monica	 She sent the chicken back again?!'
The Waitress	 She says it\xc2\x92s to dry now and she wants to come back here and\nexplain to you exactly how she wants it.'
Monica	 Well fine! I want to meet this chicken expert! Send the Colonel in!'

Monica	 (to the lobster) Lucky bastard! (Throws the lobster in and turns around\nto face the planet\xc2\x92s most annoying woman, next to Dr. Laura and Kathy Lee Gifford of\ncourse. She\xc2\x92s the most annoying female TV character however.) Janice.'
Janice	 How are you Ms. Hot Shot chef with the big fancy restaurant with the\nbest chicken ever! (Does the laugh.)'
Monica	 I\xc2\x92m fine.'
Janice	 (notices Monica\xc2\x92s engagement ring) Ohh! What is that on your\nfinger?! I\xc2\x92m blind!'
Monica	 Oh\xc2\x85 Uh\xc2\x85'
Janice	 So, who\xc2\x92s the lucky guy?'
Chandler	 OH\xc2\x85MY\xc2\x85GAWD! I am so sorry sweetie, are you okay? You\ndidn\xc2\x92t tell her we were getting married, did you?'
Monica	 Well, she saw the ring.'
Chandler	 Did she freak out?'
Monica	 Well, she was shocked when I told her, but then again so were most\npeople.'
Chandler	 Right.'
Monica	 Well, she actually has a boyfriend y\xc2\x92know herself, named Clark. Uh,\nshe also kinda invited herself to our wedding. Clark too.'
Chandler	 (laughs) You said no right?'
Monica	 Huh?'
Chandler	 You said no right?!'
Monica	 Well, she corned me! She asked if the wedding was in town! I mean, what\nwas I supposed to do?!'
Chandler	 Lie!!! How hard is that?! The check\xc2\x92s in the mail! Oh your baby\nis so cute! I can\xc2\x92t wait to read your book Ross!!'
Monica	 Come on! So she comes to the wedding! I mean it won\xc2\x92t be so bad.'
Chandler	 What do you think she\xc2\x92s just gonna sit there quietly? You\ndon\xc2\x92t think she\xc2\x92s gonna want to make a toast? You don\xc2\x92t think she\xc2\x92s\ngonna want to grab the microphone and sing Part-time Lover?!'
Monica	 Oh my God, she\xc2\x92s not gonna like the chicken that night either is\nshe?!'
Chandler	 Y\xc2\x92know what? It\xc2\x92s gonna be okay. Y\xc2\x92know what?\nShe\xc2\x92s probably not gonna even want to come.'
Monica	 Really?'
Chandler	 No! That was a lie! See how easy that was?'
Monica	 So-so you would\xc2\x92ve just lied?'
Chandler	 Yes!!'
Monica	 Would it really have been that easy?'
Chandler	 Yes!!!'
Monica	 Good, so do it Saturday night because we\xc2\x92re going to dinner with\nher and Clark.'
Joey	 Hey! What\xc2\x92s up?'

Rachel	 Oh Joey, I\xc2\x92m sorry I just couldn\xc2\x92t tell her all those things\nyou wanted me to tell her. And y\xc2\x92know we got to talking and I\xc2\x85'
Phoebe	 We want you to marry her!'
Joey	 What?!!'
Phoebe	 She is so amazing! You have no idea.'
Joey	 No idea? Who do you think brought her here?'
Rachel	 Cupid.'
Phoebe	 Joey, she\xc2\x92s so cool. She speaks four languages.'
Joey	 Man, do you know what guys want!'
Rachel	 Look Joey, come on she\xc2\x92s so perfect for you! I mean she\xc2\x92s\nsweet, she-she likes baseball, and she-she had two beers at lunch.'
Joey	 My beers?! Look you guys, she\xc2\x92s a very nice girl. Okay? We had a good\ntime, but I just\xc2\x97I don\xc2\x92t see it going anywhere.'
Phoebe	 Yeah, but you always say that.'
Rachel	 Yeah, maybe if you gave this girl a chance it would go somewhere.'
Joey	 Look I\xc2\x92m sorry you guys, I-I just don\xc2\x92t think so.'
Phoebe	 Whatever.'
Rachel	 Fine. (They start to walk away.)'
Joey	 Hey, don\xc2\x92t start judging me! (To Rachel) Huh? You\xc2\x92re the one\nwho\xc2\x92s in love with her assistant! (To Phoebe) Huh? And you, you\xc2\x92re the one\nhaving the affair with the guy who keeps the pigeons on the roof!'
Rachel	 Phoebe!'
Phoebe	 Secret affair!'
Ross	 People are doing it in front of my book!'
Rachel	 I\xc2\x92m sorry?'
Ross	 My doctoral dissertation is in the library at school, I went to see it,\nand there were students makin\xc2\x92 babies right in the middle of the Paleontology\nsection!'
Rachel	 Oh my God! Did you get to see anything good?'
Ross	 Let me ask you something, at your school was there a like uh a place on\ncampus where students went to uh, fool around.'
Rachel	 Yeah, there was. It was\xc2\x97there the corner of the library where-where\nall these dusty books that nobody ever read\xc2\x97Yes, there was.'
Ross	 Great! Because people kept showing up, I think it\xc2\x92s like uh-a thing!'
Joey	 Now hold on a second, fifth floor against that back wall?'
Ross	 Oh for cryin\xc2\x92 out loud! (He storms out.)'
Joey	 All right, so we should go catch our movie.'
Rachel	 Well now what\xc2\x92s the rush?'
Joey	 I like to see the previews. (Rachel looks at him.) The candy.'
Phoebe	 (entering with Erin) Oh. Hey!'
Rachel	 Well look who\xc2\x92s here!'
Erin	 Hey!'
Joey	 Hey!'
Erin	 Joey.'
Joey	 Erin.'
Erin	 Hey Rachel.'
Rachel	 Hi! Well, we were just about to take off and see a movie. Oh no!'
Erin	 What\xc2\x92s wrong?'
Rachel	 Oh Phoebe, we forgot that party we have to go to.'
Phoebe	 Oh no.'
Joey	 (skeptical) What party?'
Phoebe and Rachel	 A birthday party.'
Joey	 Who\xc2\x92s birthday party?'
Phoebe and Rachel	 Allison\xc2\x92s birthday party.'
Joey	 (still skeptical) Oh, and how is Allison?'
Phoebe and Rachel	 32. (Joey\xc2\x92s not buying it.)'
Rachel	 (does a retching sound) Wait a minute! Why don\xc2\x92t you guys do\nsomething?!'
Joey	 (still skeptical) Yeah, look how that worked out.'

Ross	 Excuse me. Hi, I\xc2\x92m a professor here. Do you know the Paleontology\nsection, fifth floor, stack 437?'
The Librarian	 Well, yes! Just give me five minutes, I just have to find someone\nto cover my shift.'
Ross	 No! No!! No! Can I speak to someone in charge please?! (The librarian\nbrings his boss over.)'
The Head Librarian	 How can I help you?'
Ross	 Hi, I was wondering if it is possible to increase security in the\nPaleontology section? See I-I wrote a book up there and instead of reading it people\nare-are-are well, rolling around in front of it.'
The Head Librarian	 We are aware of the problem you are referring too. (He turns\nto look at the previous librarian.) But as far as increasing security, I\xc2\x92m afraid the\nlibrary is very understaffed. I, I can\xc2\x92t help you.'
Ross	 Well, fine. Fine! If-if I\xc2\x92m the only person with any appreciation of\nthe sanctity of the written word, I\xc2\x92ll go up there and defend it myself! (Starts to\ndo so, but stops and to the previous librarian) And don\xc2\x92t you follow me!'
Joey	 Hey.'
Phoebe	 Hey!'
Rachel	 How did it go with Erin?'
Joey	 Oh, unbelievable! We had the best time!'
Phoebe	 Yay!! Oh so, you\xc2\x92re not, you\xc2\x92re not mad at us anymore?'
Joey	 No! No! No! You guys were totally right! This is so much better than the\nfirst time we went out. Y\xc2\x92know? That was so awkward, we were really nervous.'
Phoebe	 Didn\xc2\x92t you sleep together?'
Joey	 Yeah that really calms me down. And! We have so much in common! She loves\nsandwiches, sports, although she is a Met fan, not much of an issue now but if were ever\nto have kids, well that\xc2\x92s a\xc2\x85'
Rachel	 (gasps) Oh my God! Listen to you talkin\xc2\x92 about having kids. Oh my\nJoey. (She goes over and hugs him.) Oh, please don\xc2\x92t get married before I do.'
Joey	 Okay.'
Janice	 Oh. Oh I just cannot believe Clark stood me up!'
Monica	 He might still show up.'
Janice	 Oh, what are you, stupid? It\xc2\x92s been three hours.'
Monica	 Is that all?'
Janice	 I should just go on to happier things, okay? Umm, why don\xc2\x92t you\ntell about your lovely wedding?'
Chandler	 Well actually uh, there was something we wanted to tell you about the\nwedding. Um, it\xc2\x92s going to be a small ceremony. Uh, tiny! We\xc2\x92re not even sure\nwhy we\xc2\x92re having it.'
Monica	 It\xc2\x92s actually going to be just family.'
Janice	 Oh\xc2\x85wait\xc2\x85you two think of me as family?! Oh, I have to ask you\nsomething now and be honest; do you want me to sing Careless Whisper or Lady In\nRed?'
Joey	 How can you say that?! The Mets have no closer!'
Erin	 What about Benitez?'
Joey	 What about Game 1 of the Series?'
Erin	 What about shut up?'
Joey	 You shut up! (To Phoebe and Rachel) I love arguing with her. (To Erin)\nI\xc2\x92ll be right back. '
Erin	 Okay. (Joey goes to get some coffee and Erin sits down.)'
Rachel	 So how\xc2\x92s it goin\xc2\x92 with Joey?'
Erin	 Uh, okay.'
Rachel	 Okay? Wait okay, tell-tell me that you like him, please? I mean tell me\nthat you like him.'
Erin	 Look, he\xc2\x92s a really great guy and I know that you really want\nthis to work out, but I just don\xc2\x92t see this having a future.'
Rachel	 But you said that you liked him! I mean what happened?! Did ya just\nchange your mind?!'
Erin	 Kinda.'
Phoebe	 Then change it back!'
Erin	 I\xc2\x92m sorry I\xc2\x85 It\xc2\x92s just there\xc2\x92s no real spark.'
Phoebe	 No spark? Didn\xc2\x92t you sleep together?'
Erin	 Yeah.'
Rachel	 Ugh, tramp!'
Phoebe	 Does Joey have any idea?'
Erin	 I really don\xc2\x92t think he does. And y\xc2\x92know what? Maybe you guys\ncould help clue him in. Y\xc2\x92know, tell him I\xc2\x92m-I\xc2\x92m not interested in a\nserious relationship or something.'
Phoebe	 Yeah, you mean like that you\xc2\x92re kind of a loner.'
Erin	 Yeah! That would be great!'
Phoebe	 Yeah, and maybe that you\xc2\x92re a real (She says something in Italian,\nand it doesn\xc2\x92t matter what she said. It\xc2\x92s not important so I don\xc2\x92t need\neveryone who speaks Italian telling me what she said.)'
Erin	 I\xc2\x92m sorry?'
Phoebe	 Oh well, I guess Italian isn\xc2\x92t one of the four languages you speak.'
Joey	 (returning) Hey! You wanna go?'
Erin	 Yeah, let\xc2\x92s go.'
Joey	 Okay. See you guys later.'
Erin	 Bye guys.'
Rachel	 Yeah, see ya.'
Joey	 (whispers to Phoebe and Rachel) Hey, thank you so much. (They both exit.)'
Rachel	 Wow. Well, I guess it was Cupid who brought her here.'
Phoebe	 No, just a regular old flying dwarf.'
Ross	 Yes? Yes?! How can I help you?'
Guy	 Yeah, we were\xc2\x85we were just looking around.'
Ross	 Oh-oh, you\xc2\x92re-you\xc2\x92re fellow scholars. What exactly were you\nlooking for, hmm? Perhaps, (Grabs a book from the shelf behind him) perhaps Dr. Chester\nStock\xc2\x92s musings on the Smiledon Californicus?'
Guy	 Uhh\xc2\x85.'
Ross	 Ah\xc2\x85 Ah\xc2\x85Get out of here! (The couple retreats. Ross starts\nlooking through the previously mentioned book as a beautiful woman walks into the\nsection.) Uh, meeting someone? Or-or are you just here to brush up on Marion\xc2\x92s views\non evolution?'
Woman	 Uh, actually I find Marion\xc2\x92s views far to progressionist.'
Ross	 I find Marion\xc2\x92s views far to progressionist.'
Woman	 I\xc2\x92m sorry, who are you?'
Ross	 I\xc2\x92m a professor here uh, Ross\xc2\x85Geller.'
Woman	 Ross Geller, why do I know that name? It\xc2\x92s uh\xc2\x97Wait! (Grabs his\nbook off of the shelf.) Did you write this?'
Ross	 Yes! You\xc2\x92re the person who checked out my book?!'
Woman	 Y\xc2\x92know, you look nothing like I would\xc2\x92ve thought.\nYou\xc2\x92re\xc2\x85you\xc2\x92re so young.'
Ross	 Well I uh, I skipped forth grade.'
Ross	 I am very\xc2\x85very sorry.'
Joey	 Hey!'
Phoebe	 Hey!'
Rachel	 Hi!'
Phoebe	 So how was, how was your date?'
Joey	 Oh, it was great! I mean we walked all around the village. We went to this\nice cream place, split a milkshake, 70/30 but still\xc2\x85 And guess what, I\xc2\x92m\nthinking about taking her upstate to one of those bed and breakfasts.'
Phoebe	 Oh really? She said she wants to go away with you?'
Joey	 No-no-no-no-no! It\xc2\x92s a surprise, but it\xc2\x92s gonna be tricky\nthought because she said she was gonna be pretty busy at work for a while.'
Phoebe and Rachel	 Oh no, yeah.'
Rachel	 Jo-Joey, look honey we-we need to talk okay? Umm, I kinda got the\nfeeling from her today that uh, she\xc2\x92s not lookin\xc2\x92 for a serious relationship.'
Joey	 Where are you gettin\xc2\x92 this?'
Rachel	 Well, she told me. She said she\xc2\x92s kinda a loner.'
Joey	 Oh. Oh.'
Rachel	 Joey\xc2\x85'
Joey	 No hey Rach, it\xc2\x92s cool okay? Y\xc2\x92know I\xc2\x92m a loner too! (Heads\nfor his room.) Right?'
Phoebe	 Hey Joey, y\xc2\x92know what? You are way to good for her.'
Rachel	 Yeah and honey I promise next time that I will just say good-bye and\ntell \xc2\x91em you\xc2\x92re not looking for a relationship.'
Joey	 No! No. Don\xc2\x92t do that, just next time make sure she really likes me.'
Rachel	 Well that too. (Joey goes into his room.) Joey?'
Joey	 Yeah?'
Rachel	 Do you want some pancakes?'
Joey	 (coming back out) Finally!'
Monica	 What are we gonna do?'
Chandler	 I say we go with Careless Whisper.'
Janice	 Chandler?'
Chandler	 (To Monica) Did she see us yet? Did she see us?'
Monica	 Janice, what umm, what are you doing here?'
Janice	 Well umm, I thought I was going to go back to my apartment but then I\njust felt I couldn\xc2\x92t really be alone tonight. (Joey walks into view of the open door\nbehind Janice, sees her, gets a terrified look on his face, and flees in horror.) I was\nwondering if I could maybe stay here with you, just I really feel that I need to be with\nfamily.'
Monica	 (To Chandler) Our kids are gonna call her Aunt Janice aren\xc2\x92t they?'
Janice	 Please, it\xc2\x92s because otherwise I really don\xc2\x92t know what I\nmight do.'
Chandler	 Aren\xc2\x92t you just a tinsy bit curious?'
Janice	 (starting to cry) Do you have any tissues?'
Monica	 Yeah, in-in-in the bathroom.'
Janice	 Okay! (She runs for the bathroom)'
Monica	 We\xc2\x92ll just\xc2\x85we\xc2\x92ll just let her stay.'
Chandler	 No-no-no-no, if we let her stay, she will stay forever!'
Monica	 Kinda like your Barca lounger.'
Chandler	 Is that what you\xc2\x92re thinking about right now?'
Monica	 I never stop thinking about it.'
Janice	 Hey you guys, umm do either one of you want to get in there before I\ntake my bath.'
Chandler	 Janice, I\xc2\x92m sorry but umm, you can\xc2\x92t stay here tonight.'
Janice	 Why not?'
Chandler	 Honestly? Our apartment is a hotbed for electromagnetic activity. Now\nMonica and I have been immunized, but sadly you have not.'
Janice	 Okay, I\xc2\x92m going to need a comforter, but did you have a\nhypoallergenic one because otherwise I get very nasal. (Makes some weird sound) Do you\nhave a cat? \xc2\x91Cause it\xc2\x92s already happening. (Makes a nasal sound) Do you hear\nthat? (She keeps making the nasal sound.)'
Monica	 Oh my God! Oh my God! You have to go!'
Janice	 Why?'
Monica	 Because Chandler still has feelings for you!'
Janice	 He does?'
Chandler	 Say again?'
Monica	 That\xc2\x92s right. That\xc2\x92s right. And that is why you can\xc2\x92t\nstay here tonight. And probably why you shouldn\xc2\x92t come to the wedding.'
Chandler	 Feelings, such strong feelings.'
Monica	 I mean, I realize that his feelings may never completely go away, but you\ncan.'
Janice	 Oh\xc2\x85my Gawd, I-I understand. I-I am so sorry, I\xc2\x92ll go. (Starts\nfor the door.) Good-bye Monica (hugs her), I wish you a lifetime of happiness with him.\nChandler, (hugs him) you call me when this goes in the pooper. (Hurries out.)'

Ross	 (to the guard) Don\xc2\x92t sweat it, I\xc2\x92ve got this section covered.\nYeah, in fact I\xc2\x92ve got this little baby (Turns on a mini-flashlight) to shine in\npeople\xc2\x92s eye\xc2\x97(The guard walks away)\xc2\x97Okay, see you later. '
Chandler	 I just wanted to show Monica your book. (Ross just glares at him.)'
