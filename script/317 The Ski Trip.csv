Joey	 Can I see the comics?'
Chandler	 This is the New York Times.'
Joey	 Okay, may I see the comics?'
Monica	 Guys. I thought you were taking Ross to the game?'
Chandler	 We are. He\xc2\x92s meeting us here.'
Monica	 No! Rachel is meeting us here.'
Phoebe	 Oh come on, they can be in the same room.'
Joey	 Yeah, you shoulda been there last night.'
Phoebe	 Why? What happened now?'
Joey	 Well Ross was hangin\xc2\x92 out over at our place, Rachel comes over to\nborrow some moisturiser from Chandler....'
Chandler	 Yeah y-you, how hard is it to say something? Rachel came over to\nborrow something.'
Joey	 Anyway! Her and Ross just started yelling at each other.'
Phoebe	 Wait. Why was he yelling at her? He\xc2\x92s the one who slept with\nsomeone else. '
Joey	 Well, I guess he says that because they were on a break when it happened,\nthat she should of forgiven him by now.'
Phoebe	 Whoa!! He is soo unreasonable! God, although I think I understand what\nhe means. Oh my God, this is like 60 Minutes, okay, when, when, at first\nyou\xc2\x92re really mad at that pharmaceutical company for making the drug and then y'know\nyou just feel bad for the people because they needed to make their hair grow."
Chandler	 Y'know what this is like? This is like when my parents got divorced.\nMan, I hope Ross doesn\xc2\x92t try to kidnap me after Cub Scouts."
Phoebe	 Y'know I had a dream where Ross and Rachel were still together, they\nnever broke up. And we were all just like hanging out, and everyone was happy...."
Joey	 I had the same dream!'
Phoebe	 Yeah, and nobody slept with that Xerox girl. '
Joey	 Oh, I had the opposite dream.'
Chandler	 Y'know what maybe it\xc2\x92s gonna be okay, I mean it\xc2\x92s been a\nweek."
Joey	 Yeah, I mean it\xc2\x92s never taken me a week to get over a relationship.'
Monica	 It\xc2\x92s never taken you more than a shower to get over a\nrelationship.'
Monica	 (seeing her) Okay, let\xc2\x92s go!! Let\xc2\x92s hit the road!!'
Rachel	 Hey!'
Monica	 Let\xc2\x92s get the show on it! '
Rachel	 Okay, let me just get a cup of coffee.'
Monica	 Oh Rachel, I know the best coffee house and it\xc2\x92s sooo close.'
Rachel	 Closer than here?'
Phoebe	 (turning around and picking a cup off of a table) Oh, hey, look, I found\ncoffee! (handing her the cup) Okay, let\xc2\x92s skedaddle.'
Rachel	 Wait, I\xc2\x92m not just gonna drink somebody\xc2\x92s old coffee.'
Phoebe	 Okay, your highness.'
Phoebe	 (in a deep voice, imitating Ross) Um, Rachel I\xc2\x92m really sorry.\n(imitating Rachel) That\xc2\x92s okay, do you wanna get back together? (imitating Ross)\nYeah, okay. (in her normal voice) Did anyone else hear that?!'

Rachel	 (softly) Is he here?'
Chandler	 No.'
Rachel	 Oh. (smiles) Here\xc2\x92s your moisturiser. Hi! '
Monica and Phoebe	 Hey!'
Rachel	 You guys are gonna love meee! Okay, check it out, Thursday night, five\ntickets, Calvin Klein lingerie show, and you guys are coming with me. (they\xc2\x92re\nall silent and look away) Okay, I said that out loud right?'
Chandler	 Yes, yes, it\xc2\x92s just that we ah, we kinda all ready, made plans\nwith Ross.'
Rachel	 Oh, well okay. Well, there you go.'
Phoebe	 No, it\xc2\x92s just that he got this new like home theater dealie, and he\nwants y'know, us to check it out."
Rachel	 Hm-mm.'
Chandler	 Yeah, he\xc2\x92s really excited about it too, he even recorded show\ntimes on his answering machine.'
Rachel	 Ohh!'
Monica	 We\xc2\x92re sorry honey.'
Rachel	 Oh, it\xc2\x92s okay. (starts to leave)'
Joey	 Rach, it\xc2\x92s, it\xc2\x92s ah, it\xc2\x92s not that we don\xc2\x92t want to,\nreally. (quietly) Are we talking models in their underwear?'
Rachel	 And heels.'
Joey	 (He turns around to Chandler looking for approval to go with Rachel,\nChandler mouths \xc2\x91Come on!\xc2\x92) (turning back to Rachel) Ross, did ask us first, and\nwe set that night aside.'
Rachel	 No, hey, come on, if he asked you first, that\xc2\x92s only fair. (leaves)'
Phoebe	 Ohhh boy, do I feel bad.'
Joey	 Oh yeah.'
Monica	 Very bad.'
Phoebe	 Chandler what are you doing?!'
Monica	 Chandler!!'
Chandler	 (jumps back and points at the cigarette) Oh my God!'
Joey	 You\xc2\x92re smoking again?!'
Chandler	 Well, actually, yesterday I was smoking again. Today, I\xc2\x92m,\nI\xc2\x92m smoking still.'
Phoebe	 Why would you start again after chewing all that quitting gum?'
Chandler	 Look, I\xc2\x92m telling you this is just like my parents divorce, which\nis when I started smoking in the first place.'
Monica	 Weren\xc2\x92t you nine?!'
Chandler	 Yeahhh. I\xc2\x92m tellin\xc2\x92 ya something, that ah, first smoke after\nnap time....'
Chandler	 Oh that\xc2\x92s great, with my luck, that\xc2\x92s gonna be him.'
Phoebe	 Him? Him, Ross?'
Chandler	 Nope, hymn 253, His Eyes Are On The Sparrow! When my parents got\ndivorced is when I started using humour as a defence mechanism. (answers the door and\nit\xc2\x92s Rachel again.)'
Rachel	 Hi! Uhh, do you guys have plans for the weekend? Because I have my\nsister on hold, and she said that we could use her cabin for the weekend and go skiing.\nHuh? I\xc2\x92m asking you first, right?!. I mean I\xc2\x92m playing by the rules.'
All	 Absolutely, yeah!'
Rachel	 Chandler! You\xc2\x92re smoking? What are you doing?!'
Chandler	 Hey, shut up!! You\xc2\x92re not my real Mom!!'
Joey	 (obviously cold) Hey, can you close that window Chandler? My nipples can\ncut glass over here!'
Phoebe	 Wait. Really?! \xc2\x91Cause mine get me out of tickets.'
Ross	 Look, you guys I just wanna say, I really, really appreciate you spending\nthis time with me. It\xc2\x92s been a pretty hard time right now, so I just wanna say\nthanks.'
Chandler	 Can somebody else hug him? I have to stay by the window.'
Ross	 Oh hey, hey, huh, how about this weekend we have a laser disc marathon\nokay, and maybe a tournament on my new dart board? Huh, huh, what do you think? (in an\nIrish accent) Two days of darts, it\xc2\x92ll be great!'

Ross	 No, no, no, this weekend guys!'
Joey	 It\xc2\x92ll be great for next weekend. I mean, (in an Irish accent)\nit\xc2\x92ll be grrreat.'
Ross	 What\xc2\x92s going on?'
Phoebe	 Well, we were um, sorta invited to go skiing, y'know Rachel\xc2\x92s\nsister\xc2\x92s cabin. (Chandler goes back to the window to smoke again.)"
Ross	 So, for the whole weekend?'
Monica	 We\xc2\x92re really sorry, but um, she did ask us first.'
Ross	 Yeah, that\xc2\x92s okay, I mean if you guys all have to go away for\nthe first weekend I\xc2\x92m alone by myself, y'know then I totally, totally understand."
Phoebe	 Y'know what, I can stay, I\xc2\x92m gonna stay. \xc2\x91Cause the last time\nI went skiing I was to afraid to jump off the chair lift, I just went around and around."
Joey	 Uh, Pheebs we kinda need you to drive us all up there in your\ngrandmother\xc2\x92s cab, but y'know what, I\xc2\x92ll stay."
Monica	 Noo! I\xc2\x92ll stay. He\xc2\x92s my brother.'

Ross	 Pity food? Y'know what that\xc2\x92s okay, all right, I don\xc2\x92t need any\nof you to stay, okay nobody stays."
Chandler	 Well, then, I might as well offer to stay.'
Joey	 (to Chandler and Monica) Hey, does anybody else feel bad about Ross?'
Monica	 Why? Do you think he\xc2\x92s still mad at us?'
Chandler	 (to Joey) Well he\xc2\x92s probably mad after you called him this\nmorning to borrow his goggles.'
Joey	 What? Mine aren\xc2\x92t tinted.'
Phoebe	 Chandler!!'
Chandler	 What?'
Phoebe	 What does the sign say?'
Chandler	 Beam me up Jesus.'
Phoebe	 No, the \xc2\x91No Smoking\xc2\x92 sign. There\xc2\x92s no smoking in my\nGrandmother\xc2\x92s cab.'

Rachel	 No. Thank you.'
Monica	 (getting out) No, Rachel never pees in public restrooms.'
Rachel	 Well, they never have any paper in there y'know. So my rule is \xc2\x91no\ntissue, no tuschy.\xc2\x92 (Phoebe laughs and gets out.) Well, if everybody\xc2\x92s going.\n(She gets out and starts to close the door.)"
Phoebe	 No, y'know what don\xc2\x92t close it (Rachel slams the door shut locking\nthemselves out.) \xc2\x91cause the... keys...are in there."

Joey	 Relax okay, I-I-I can get this open. Anybody have a coat hanger?'
Chandler	 Oh I do! Op, no, wait a minute, I took it out of my shirt when I put\nit on this morning.'
Monica	 So, if you\xc2\x92re parents hadn\xc2\x92t got divorced, you\xc2\x92d be able\nto answer a question like a normal person?'
Joey	 Look, I just need a wire something to jimmy it. Oh hey, one of you guys\ngive me the underwire from your bra!'
Monica	 What?!'
Rachel	 What?!'
Joey	 Come on! Who has the biggest boobs?'
Monica	 Please!!'
Joey	 Whoever has the biggest boobs, has the biggest bra, therefore has the\nbiggest wire.'
The Girls	 No, not getting my bra!'
Joey	 If you wanna get back in the car, we need the wire, your call.'
Phoebe	 Okay, Monica\xc2\x92s are the biggest.'
Monica	 These tiny, little non-breasts?! Please, it\xc2\x92s gotta be Rachel.'
Rachel	 What, no, no, no, mine are deceptively small I mean, I-I-I actually\nsometimes, st-stuff my bra.'
Monica	 All right then, your bra would still be big.'
Rachel	 No, I stuff outside the bra.'
Chandler	 Ladies, ladies, let\xc2\x92s just compromise okay? Phoebe, Rachel take\noff Monica\xc2\x92s bra.'
Phoebe	 All right, forget it, nevermind, you can have mine.'
Rachel	 (seeing him) Chandler, what are you doing? There is a trash can right\nthere.'
Chandler	 Well, I thought if I littered, that crying Indian might come by and\nsave us.'
Phoebe	 (finishing removing her bra) Okay, there.'
Joey	 Thank you Phoebe, that is very, very generous.'
Chandler	 Okay, now let\xc2\x92s decide who has the nicest ass.'
Joey	 (opening the door) And there you go!'
All	 Oh, yeahhhhh!!!'
Monica	 Chandler!!'
Chandler	 At least let me smoke it to the good part.'
Phoebe	 Okay. (The car moves a few feet and sputters to a stop.) Oh, no!'
Rachel	 What, what\xc2\x92s it, what\xc2\x92s going on?'
Phoebe	 Yeah, this has happened before.'
Rachel	 So you know how to fix it?'
Phoebe	 Yep. Put more gas in.'

Carol	 Hey, what are you doing here?'
Ross	 Well, oh just ah, I was just wondering, when you and I split up, did you\nget the tape that was half the last episode of M*A*S*H and half the hostages\ncoming home?'
Carol	 Ah yeah, but now it\xc2\x92s Susan and me in Mexico and the hostages coming\nhome.'

Carol	 It\xc2\x92s not that kind of anniversary.'
Ross	 Ah! (realises) Oh.'
Carol	 Sooo!! Anyway...'
Ross	 Umm, candles, champagne, yeah anniversaries are great. \xc2\x91Cause you\nknow love lasts forever, y'know. Nothing like it in this lifetime, money in the bank, so\nRachel and I broke up."
Carol	 Oh God, Ross I am so sorry.'
Ross	 Yeah, well.'
Carol	 Y'know what, I want to talk to you about this so much, but we should\nprobably do it when we could really get into it, are you free for dinner tomorrow night?"
Ross	 Oh yeah, I\xc2\x92d love that.'
Carol	 Oh, great! Me too.'
Ross	 I guess it all started when Rachel got this new job. (he sits down at the\ntable.)'
Phoebe	 Okay, yeah. (to Monica and Rachel) Triple A can pick us up.'
Rachel	 Great!'
Phoebe	 Yeah, what town are we near?'
Monica	 Freemont. West-Westmont, ah Westburg?'
Phoebe	 (to Monica) Then why are you answering? Do you at least know what route\nwe\xc2\x92re on?'
Rachel	 Yeah, we are definitely on Route 27.'
Phoebe	 Okay. (on phone) We are at a rest stop on Route 27. Okay. (to Rachel)\nThere is no Route 27. (listens) (to Rachel) Okay, either 93 or 76?'
Rachel	 I don\xc2\x92t know, I\xc2\x92m sorry, I always slept in the back when we\ndrove up here.'
Phoebe	 Okay. (on phone) Hey, can you send somebody up and down 76 and check\nevery rest stop, and, and also 93? (listens) Okay! (hangs up) Yeah, no they don\xc2\x92t do\nthat.'
Rachel	 Ugh, okay, well somebody will come and save us.'
Monica	 Who? I mean have you seen a car come by here in the last hour and a\nhalf? I think we should call Ross, maybe he can get a car and come pick us up.'
Rachel	 No! No, I am not getting in a car with Ross, we will just have to live\nhere! '
Phoebe	 But if...'
Rachel	 No you guys, I am not getting in a car with him, you\xc2\x92ll have to\nthink of something else.'
Phoebe	 Oh good, oh Joey and Chandler are back.'
Monica	 So the going for help went well?'
Joey	 Oh yeah, Smokey Joe here got half way to the highway and collapsed.'
Chandler	 I have the lung capacity of a two year old. (starts to light another\ncigarette.)'
Monica	 Then why are you smoking?'
Chandler	 Well it\xc2\x92s very unsettling.'
Ross	 ....right? Right? I mean it\xc2\x92s pretty unbelievable y'know, I mean they\njust took off, took off without even looking back. Y'know I don\xc2\x92t, I don\xc2\x92t need\nthem, huh, I\xc2\x92ve got you guys now as friends, you and Susan."
Carol	 Ah, Susan will be so pleased.'
Ross	 (looking at the page) 717? (to Carol) Where\xc2\x92s 717? (He gets up to\nreturn the page, Carol starts to take the last of the food into the kitchen, but Ross\ngrabs the last piece.) Hey, you\xc2\x92ve have more of these for Susan right?'
Carol	 No. But it\xc2\x92s okay, I\xc2\x92ll just put out pickles or something.'
Phoebe	 (answering the phone) (whispering) Ross, thank God.'
Ross	 Pheebs? What, why are you whispering?'
Phoebe	 I ate a bug.'
Monica	 (running over to stop Rachel) Hey Rach, the tampons here are only a\npenny. Let\xc2\x92s stock up. (takes her into the bathroom)'
Phoebe	 Listen Ross, we ran out of gas, and we don\xc2\x92t know where we are, so\nwe can\xc2\x92t get a tow truck.'
Ross	 Oh, now you want a favour?'
Phoebe	 Yes, please.'
Ross	 Well, oh, I\xc2\x92m sorry your car broke down Pheebs, but I\xc2\x92m a little\ntoo busy with some of my real friends right now, but please call to let me know you got\nhome safely okay?'
Carol	 (running over and grabbing the phone away from Ross) (on phone) Phoebe,\nhang on a second. (Hands Ross her keys) Here, take my car, go pick up your friends.'
Ross	 No, I\xc2\x92m not gonna pick them up.'
Carol	 Listen, we both know you\xc2\x92re gonna do it \xc2\x91cause you\xc2\x92re not\na jerk. Okay? So you can either sulk here for a half hour and then go pick them up, or\nsave us both time and sulk in the car.'
Ross	 No, Rachel doesn\xc2\x92t want me to....'
Carol	 Look, I-I-I am sorry that Rachel dumped you \xc2\x91cause she fell in love\nwith that Mark guy, and you are the innocent victim in all of this, but don\xc2\x92t punish\nyour friends for what Rachel did to you.'
Ross	 Yeah, you\xc2\x92re right.'
Carol	 (on phone) Phoebe hang on a second Ross wants to say something. (listens)\nWhat? (listens) (to Ross) You slept with someone else?!'
Ross	 We were on a break!!! Okay!! (grabs the phone) We were, we were..., (calms\ndown) yeah. Where are you? I\xc2\x92ll find you. (hangs up)'
Carol	 You slept with another woman?'

Joey	 Okay, done.'
Monica	 (reading the sign) What\xc2\x92s \xc2\x91pleh\xc2\x92?'
