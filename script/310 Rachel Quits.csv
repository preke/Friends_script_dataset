Chandler	 (reading the comics) Eh..., I don\xc2\x92t, I don\xc2\x92t know.'
Rachel	 What?'
Chandler	 Well, as old as he is in dog years, do you think Snoopy should still\nbe allowed to fly this thing?'
Gunther	 Rachel?'
Rachel	 Yeah.'
Gunther	 Do you remember when you first came here, how you spent two weeks\ngetting trained by another waitress?'
Rachel	 Oh, sure! Do you need me to train somebody new?'
Gunther	 (laughs) Good one. Actually, ah, Terry wants you to take the training\nagain, whenever.'
Rachel	 (to Chandler) Eh, do you believe that?'
Chandler	 (thinks about it) Yeah?'

Sarah	 So that\xc2\x92s two boxes of the Holiday Macaroons. On behalf of the Brown\nBirds of America, I salute you. (Does the Brown Bird salute, she blows on a bird call,\nthen holds her hand, palm facing out, next to her face, and then waves it like a bird\nflapping it\xc2\x92s wings.)'
Ross	 Just admit it Chandler, you have no backhand.'
Chandler	 Excuse me little one, I have a very solid backhand.'
Ross	 Shielding your face and shrieking like a girl... is not a backhand.'
Chandler	 I was shrieking... like a Marine.'
Ross	 All right here. Watch me execute the three \xc2\x91P\xc2\x92s of championship\nplay. Power. (swings the racquet) Precision. (swings the racquet.) and penache. (does a\nbackswing and hits Sarah who\xc2\x92s started up the stairs, knocking her down, they both\nwatch in horror.)'
Monica	 You broke a little girl\xc2\x92s leg?!!'
Ross	 I know. I feel horrible. Okay.'
Chandler	 (reading the paper) Says here that a muppet got whacked on Seasame\nStreet last night. (to Ross) Where exactly were around ten-ish?'
Ross	 Well, I\xc2\x92m gonna go see her. I want to bring her something, what do\nyou think she\xc2\x92ll like?'
Monica	 Maybe a Hello Kitty doll, the ability to walk...'
Rachel	 I\xc2\x92m gonna get back to retraining. (gets up)'
Ross	 All right, see you guys. (starts to leave)'
Chandler	 Look out kids, he\xc2\x92s coming! (Ross continues to leave with his\nhead down in shame.)'
Joey	 And I gotta go sell some Christmas trees.'
Phoebe	 Have fun. Oh wait, no, don\xc2\x92t! I forgot I am totally against that\nnow.'
Joey	 What? Me having a job?'
Phoebe	 No, no, I am against innocent trees being cut down in their prime, and\ntheir, their corpses grotesquely dressed in like tinsel and twinkly lights. (to Joey) Hey,\nhow do you sleep at night?'
Joey	 Well, I\xc2\x92m pretty tired from lugging the trees around all day. Hey,\nPhoebe listen, you got this all wrong. Those trees were born to be Christmas trees, their\nfulfilling their life purpose, by, by making people happy.'
Phoebe	 Really?'
Chandler	 Yes. Yes, and ah, ah, the trees are happy too, because for most of\nthem, it\xc2\x92s the only chance to see New York.'
Gunther	 ...and after you\xc2\x92ve delivered the drinks, you take the empty\ntray....'
Rachel	 Gunther, Gunther, please, I\xc2\x92ve worked here for two and a half\nyears, I know the empty trays go over there. (points to the counter.)'
Gunther	 What if you put them here. (sets the empty tray on another stack of\nempty trays on the back counter.)'
Rachel	 Huh. Well, y'know that\xc2\x92s actually a really good idea, because that\nway they\xc2\x92ll be closer to the mugs. Y'know what, you should have the other waitresses\ndo that too."
Gunther	 They already do. That\xc2\x92s why they call it the \xc2\x91tray\nspot.\xc2\x92'
Rachel	 Gee, I always heard them talk about that, I just always thought that it\nwas a club they went to. Oh God, I\xc2\x92m, I\xc2\x92m sorry. (walks away)'
Gunther	 It\xc2\x92s all right. Sweetheart.'
Ross	 So, this must be kinda neat for ya, huh? I mean, your Dad tells me that\nyou get a couple of days off school, and you, you ah, don\xc2\x92t have to sell those\ncookies anymore. '
Sarah	 Well, I kinda wanted to sell the cookies. The girl who sells the most\nwins a trip to Spacecamp, and gets to sit in a real space shuttle.'
Ross	 Wow, you ah, you really like all this space stuff, huh?'
Sarah	 Yeah. My Dad says if I spend as much time helping him clean apartments,\nas I do daydreaming about outer space, he\xc2\x92d be able to afford a trip to the Taj\nMahal.'
Ross	 I think you would have to clean a whole lot of apartments to go all the\nway to India.'
Sarah	 No. The one in Atlantic City, Dad loves the slots. He says he\xc2\x92s\ngonna double the college money my Grandma left me.'
Ross	 Huh. Well, good luck to Dad. Say, how many more boxes would you have to\nsell in order to win?'
Sarah	 The girl who won last year sold four hundred and seventy-five.'
Ross	 Yeah.'
Sarah	 So far, I\xc2\x92ve sold seventy-five.'
Ross	 Four hundred, huh? Well, that sounds do-able. (starts to get out his\nwallet) How much are the boxes?'
Sarah	 Five dollars a box.'
Ross	 (puts away his wallet) And what is second prize?'
Sarah	 A ten speed bike. But, I\xc2\x92d rather have something my Dad\ncouldn\xc2\x92t sell.'
Ross	 Well, that makes sense.'
Sarah	 Could you do me one favor, if it\xc2\x92s not too much trouble?'
Ross	 Yeah, Sarah, anything.'
Sarah	 Could you pull open the curtains for me? The astronauts from the space\nshuttle are gonna be on the news, and since we don\xc2\x92t have a TV, the lady across the\nalley said she\xc2\x92d push hers up to a window, so I could watch it.'
Woman	 (looking through her peephole, we see Ross standing in the hallway.)\nYesss?'
Ross	 Hi, I\xc2\x92m selling Brown Bird cookies.'
Woman	 You\xc2\x92re no Brown Bird, I can see you through my peephole.'
Ross	 No, hi, I\xc2\x92m, I\xc2\x92m an honorary Brown Bird (does the Brown Bird\nsalute.)'
Woman	 What does that mean?'
Ross	 Ah, well, it means that I can sell cookies, but I\xc2\x92m not invited to\nsleep-overs.'
Woman	 I can dial 9-1-1 at the touch of a button, y'know. Now, go away!"
Ross	 No, please, please, um, it\xc2\x92s for a poor little girl who wants to go\nto Spacecamp more than anything in the world.'
Woman	 I\xc2\x92m pressing, a policeman is on his way.'
Ross	 Okay, okay! I\xc2\x92m going. I\xc2\x92m going. (goes across the hall to knock\non another door.)'
Woman	 I can still see you!'
Ross	 All right!!'
Phoebe	 (walking up to Joey) Hey.'
Joey	 Hey. What, what are you doing here?'
Phoebe	 Well, I-I thought a lot about what you said, and um, I realilized duh,\nall right maybe I was a little judgmental. Yeah, (looks at the tree) oh, but oh...'
Joey	 Look now, Phoebe remember, hey, their just fulfilling their Christmas....'
Phoebe	 Destiny.'
Joey	 Sure.'
Phoebe	 Yes.'
Joey	 All right.'
Phoebe	 Okay. (One of Joey\xc2\x92s co-workers, walks by with a dead tree.) Yikes!\nThat one doesn\xc2\x92t look very fulfilled.'
Joey	 Oh, that\xc2\x92s, that\xc2\x92s ah, one of the old ones, he\xc2\x92s just\ntaking it to the back.'
Phoebe	 You keep the old ones in the back, that is so ageist.'
Joey	 Well we have to make room for the fresh ones.'
Phoebe	 So, what happens to the old guys?'
Joey	 Well, they go into the chipper.'
Phoebe	 Why, do I have a feeling that\xc2\x92s not as happy as it sounds? (Joey\npoints out one going into the chipper to her, as this haunty, demonic music starts to play\nin the background) No! Nooooo!!! (she winces in horror and hides her face against\nJoey\xc2\x92s shoulder, as she sees the tree spit out from the chipper.)'
Joey	 (to the guy operating the chipper) Hey! Hey!! (makes the \xc2\x91cut\nit\xc2\x92 motion with his hands)'
Ross	 ...and these come in the shapes of your favourite Christmas characters,\nSanta, Rudolph, and Baby Jesus.'
Joey	 All right, I\xc2\x92ll take a box of the cream filled Jesus\xc2\x92s.'
Ross	 Wait a minute, one box! Come on, I\xc2\x92m trying to send a little girl to\nSpacecamp, I\xc2\x92m putting you down for five boxes. Chandler, what about you?'
Chandler	 Ahh, do you have any coconut flavoured deities?'
Ross	 No, but ah, there\xc2\x92s coconut in the Hanukkah Menoreoes. I tell you\nwhat, I\xc2\x92ll put you down for eight boxes, one for each night.'
Ross	 Mon?'
Monica	 All right, I\xc2\x92ll take one box of the mint treasures, just one, and\nthat\xc2\x92s it. I-I started gaining weight after I joined the Brown Birds. (to Ross)\nRemember, how Dad bought all my boxes and I ate them all?'
Ross	 Ah, no Mon, Dad had to buy everyone of your boxes because\nyou ate them all. But ah, y'know I\xc2\x92m sure that\xc2\x92s not gonna happen this time, why\ndon\xc2\x92t I put you down for three of the mint treasures and just a couple of the\nRudolph\xc2\x92s."
Monica	 No.'
Ross	 Oh, come on, now you know you want \xc2\x91em.'
Monica	 Don\xc2\x92t, don\xc2\x92t, don\xc2\x92t, don\xc2\x92t, don\xc2\x92t do this.'
Ross	 I\xc2\x92ll tell you what Mon, I\xc2\x92ll give you the first box for free.'
Monica	 (she reaches out for it and stops) Oh God! I gotta go! (runs out)'
Ross	 Come on! All the cool kids are eating \xc2\x91em! (chases after her.)'
Gunther	 And when you have a second later, I wanna show you why we don\xc2\x92t\njust trap spiders under coffee mugs and leave them there.'
Rachel	 (sitting down next to Chandler) I\xc2\x92m training to be better at a job\nthat I hate, my life officially sucks.'
Joey	 Look Rach, wasn\xc2\x92t this supposed to a temporary thing? I thought you\nwanted to do fashion stuff?'
Rachel	 Well, yeah! I\xc2\x92m still pursuing that.'
Chandler	 How... exactly are you pursuing that? Y'know other than sending out\nresumes like what, two years ago?"
Rachel	 Well, I\xc2\x92m also sending out.... good thoughts.'
Joey	 If you ask me, as long as you got this job, you\xc2\x92ve got nothing\npushing you to get another one. You need the fear.'
Rachel	 The fear?'
Chandler	 He\xc2\x92s right, if you quit this job, you then have motivation to go\nafter a job you really want.'
Rachel	 Well then how come you\xc2\x92re still at a job that you hate, I mean why\ndon\xc2\x92t you quit and get \xc2\x91the fear\xc2\x92?'
Chandler	 Because, I\xc2\x92m too afraid.'
Rachel	 I don\xc2\x92t know, I mean I would give anything to work for a designer,\ny'know, or a buyer.... Oh, I just don\xc2\x92t want to be 30 and still work here."
Chandler	 Yeah, that\xc2\x92d be much worse than being 28, and still\nworking here.'
Gunther	 Rachel?'
Rachel	 Yeah.'
Gunther	 Remind me to review with you which pot is decaf and which is regular.'
Rachel	 Can\xc2\x92t I just look at the handles on them?'
Gunther	 You would think.'
Rachel	 Okay, fine. Gunther, y'know what, I am a terrible waitress, do you know\nwhy I\xc2\x92m a terrible waitress? Because, I don\xc2\x92t care. I don\xc2\x92t care. I\ndon\xc2\x92t care which pot is regular and which pot is decaf, I don\xc2\x92t care where the\ntray spot is, I just don\xc2\x92t care, this is not what I want to do. So I don\xc2\x92t think\nI should do it anymore. I\xc2\x92m gonna give you my weeks notice."
Gunther	 What?!'
Rachel	 Gunther, I quit.'
Chandler	 (to Joey) Does this mean we\xc2\x92re gonna have to start paying for\ncoffee? (Joey shrugs his shoulders.)'

Ross	 ....and 12, 22, 18, four... (Chandler starts laughing) What?'
Chandler	 I spelled out boobies.'
Monica	 (comes up and starts looking through Ross\xc2\x92s cookie supply) Ross,\nbut me down for another box of the mint treasures, okay. Where, where are the mint\ntreasures?'
Ross	 Ah, we\xc2\x92re out. I sold them all.'
Monica	 What?'
Ross	 Monica, I\xc2\x92m cutting you off.'
Monica	 No. No, just, just, just a couple more boxes. It-it-it\xc2\x92s no big\ndeal, all right, I\xc2\x92m-I\xc2\x92m cool. You gotta help me out with a couple more boxes!'
Ross	 Mon, look at yourself. You have cookie on your neck.'
Monica	 (covers her neck) Oh God! (runs to the bathroom)'
Chandler	 So, how many have you sold so far?'
Ross	 Check this out. Five hundred and seventeen boxes!'
Chandler	 Oh my God, how did you do that?'
Ross	 Okay, the other night I was leaving the museum just as \xc2\x91Laser\nFloyd\xc2\x92 was letting out of the planetarium, without even trying I sold 50 boxes!\nThat\xc2\x92s when it occurred to me, the key to my success, \xc2\x91the munchies.\xc2\x92 So I\nah, started hitting the NYU dorms around midnight. I am selling cookies by the case. They\ncall me
Rachel	 (entering) Okay, stop what you\xc2\x92re doing, I need envelope stuffers,\nI need stamp lickers.....'
Ross	 Well hey, who did these resumes for ya?'
Chandler	 Me! On my computer.'
Ross	 Well you sure used a large font.'
Chandler	 Eh, yeah, well ah, waitress at a coffee shop and cheer squad\nco-captain only took up so much room.'
Rachel	 Hey-hey-hey that\xc2\x92s funny! Your funny Chandler! Your a funny guy!\nYou wanna know what else is really funny?!'
Chandler	 Something else I might have said?'
Rachel	 I don\xc2\x92t know, I don\xc2\x92t know, weren\xc2\x92t you the guy that told\nme to quit my job when I had absolutely nothing else to do. Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!!'
Ross	 Sweetie, calm down, it\xc2\x92s gonna be okay.'
Rachel	 No, it\xc2\x92s not gonna be okay Ross, tomorrow is my last day, and I\ndon\xc2\x92t have a lead. Okay, y'know what, I\xc2\x92m just gonna, I\xc2\x92m just gonna call\nGunther and I\xc2\x92m gonna tell him, I\xc2\x92m not quitting."
Chandler	 You-you-you don\xc2\x92t wanna give into the fear.'
Rachel	 You and your stupid fear. I hate your fear. I would like to take you and\nyour fear.... '
Joey	 (entering, interrupting Rachel) Hey! I got great news!'
Chandler	 Run, Joey! Run for your life! (runs out)'
Joey	 What? Rachel, listen, have you ever heard of Fortunata Fashions?'
Rachel	 No.'
Joey	 Well my old man is doing a plumbing job down there and he heard they have\nan opening. So, you want me to see if I can get you an interview?'
Rachel	 Oh my God! Yes, I would love that, oh, that is soo sweet, Joey.'
Joey	 Not a problem.'
Rachel	 Thanks.'
Joey	 And now for the great news.'
Ross	 What, that wasn\xc2\x92t the great news?'
Joey	 Only if you think it\xc2\x92s better than this... (holds up an aerosol can)\nsnow-in-a-can!! I got it at work. Mon, you want me to decorate the window, give it a kind\nof Christmas lookie.'
Monica	 Christmas cookie?'
Joey	 Okay, and ah, this one here is a Douglas Fir, now it\xc2\x92s a little more\nmoney, but you get a nicer smell.'
Guy	 Looks good. I\xc2\x92ll take it.'
Phoebe	 (running up carrying a tree) Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! No, no, you\ndon\xc2\x92t want that one. No, you can have this cool brown one. (points to the almost dead\ntree she has)'
Guy	 It\xc2\x92s-it\xc2\x92s-it\xc2\x92s almost dead!'
Phoebe	 Okay but that\xc2\x92s why you have to buy it, so it can fulfil it\xc2\x92s\nChristmas destiny, otherwise there gonna throw it into the chipper. Tell him, Joey'
Joey	 Yeah, the ah, trees that don\xc2\x92t fulfil their Christmas destiny are\nthrown in the chipper.'
Guy	 I-I think I\xc2\x92m gonna look around a little bit more.'
Joey	 Pheebs, you gotta stop this, I working on commission here.'
Monica	 (entering) Hey, guys. I\xc2\x92m here to pick out my Christmas tree.'
Phoebe	 Well look no further, (shows her the dead one) this one\xc2\x92s yours!\nAhhh.'
Monica	 Is this the one that I threw out last year?'
Phoebe	 All right y'know what, nevermind! Everyone wants to have a green one!\nI\xc2\x92m sorry, I\xc2\x92m sorry, I didn\xc2\x92t mean to get so emotional, I guess it\xc2\x92s\njust the holidays, it\xc2\x92s hard."
Monica	 Oh honey, is that \xc2\x91cause your Mom died around Christmas?'
Phoebe	 Oh, I wasn\xc2\x92t even thinking about that.'
Monica	 Oh. (turns and looks at Joey, who gives a \xc2\x91way-to-go\xc2\x92 thumbs\nup and smile.)'
Ross	 (to the girl sitting next to him) Hi there. How many, how many ah, did you\nsell?'
Girl	 I\xc2\x92m not gonna tell you! You\xc2\x92re the bad man who broke\nSarah\xc2\x92s leg.'
Ross	 Hey now! That was an accident, okay.'
Girl	 You\xc2\x92re a big scrud.'
Ross	 What\xc2\x92s a scrud?'
Girl	 Why don\xc2\x92t you look in the mirror, scrud.'
Ross	 I don\xc2\x92t have too. I can just look at you.'
Leader	 All right girls, and man. Let\xc2\x92s see your final tallies. (all the\ngirls raise their hands) Ohhhh, Debbie, (looks at her form) 321 boxes of cookies, (to\nDebbie) Very nice.'
Ross	 (to himself) Not nice enough.'
Leader	 Charla, 278. Sorry, dear, but still good.'
Ross	 (to himself) Good for a scrud.'
Leader	 Oh, yes Elizabeth. Ah, 871.'
Ross	 That\xc2\x92s crap!! Sister Brown Bird. (to Elizabeth) Good going. (does the\nsalute)'
Leader	 Who\xc2\x92s next? (goes over and stands behind Ross, who\xc2\x92s\nfeverishly writing on his form, and clears her throat to get his attention.)'
Ross	 Hi there!'
Leader	 Hi. And batting for Sarah, Ross Geller, 872. Although, it looks like you\nbought an awful lot of cookies yourself.'
Ross	 Um, that is because my doctor says that I have a very serious....\nnuget.... diffency.'
Chandler	 Tell us what happened, Brown Bird Ross.'
Ross	 Well, I lost. Some little girl loaned her uniform to her nineteen year old\nsister, who went down to the U.S.S. Nimitz, and sold over 2,000 boxes.'
Chandler	 (to Rachel, who\xc2\x92s entering) Hey! How\xc2\x92d the interview go?'
Rachel	 Oh, I blew it. I wouldn\xc2\x92t of even hired me.'
Ross	 Oh, come here sweetie, listen, you\xc2\x92re gonna go on like a thousand\ninterviews before you get a job. (she glares at him) That\xc2\x92s not how that was supposed\nto come out.'
Phoebe	 This is the worst Christmas ever.'
Chandler	 Y'know what Rach, maybe you should just, y'know stay here at the\ncoffee house."
Rachel	 I can\xc2\x92t! It\xc2\x92s too late! Terry already hired that girl over\nthere. (points to her) Look at her, she\xc2\x92s even got waitress experience. Last night\nshe was teaching everybody how to make napkin.... (starts to cry) swans.'
Ross	 That word was swans.'
Chandler	 Well seeing that drunk Santa wet himself, really perked up my\nChristmas.'
Phoebe	 Oh! Oh my God!'
Joey and Monica	 (jumping up from behind the couch) Merry Christmas!!'
Phoebe	 You saved them! You guys! Oh God, you\xc2\x92re the best!'
Chandler	 It\xc2\x92s like \xc2\x91Night of the Living Dead Christmas Trees.\xc2\x92'
Rachel	 (answering the phone) Hello? (listens) Yeah, this is she. (listens) Oh!\nYou\xc2\x92re kidding! You\xc2\x92re kidding! (listens) Oh thank you! I love you!'
Chandler	 Sure, everybody loves a kidder.'
Rachel	 (hanging up the phone) I got the job!'
All	 That\xc2\x92s great! Hey! Excellent!'
Phoebe	 Oh, God bless us, everyone.'
Rachel	 Here we go. I\xc2\x92m serving my last cup of coffee. (the gang starts\nhumming the graduation theme) There you go. (hands it to Chandler) Enjoy. (they all cheer)'
Chandler	 (to Ross) Should I tell her I ordered tea?'
Ross	 No. '
Rachel	 Um, excuse me, everyone. Ah, this is my last night working here, and I\nah, just wanted say that I made some really good friends working here, and ah, it\xc2\x92s\njust time to move on. (at the counter Gunther starts to cry and runs into the back room)\nAh, and no offence to everybody who ah, still works here, you have no idea how good it\nfeels to say that as of this moment I will never have to make coffee again.'
Rachel\xc2\x92s Boss	 Now Mr. Kaplan Sr. likes his coffee strong, so your gonna\nuse two bags instead of one, see. Now pay attention, \xc2\x91cause this part\xc2\x92s tricky,\nsee some people use filters just once.'

Ross	 I\xc2\x92m, I\xc2\x92m sorry you didn\xc2\x92t get to go to Spacecamp, and\nI\xc2\x92m hoping that maybe somehow, this may make up for it. Presenting Sarah\nTuttle\xc2\x92s Private Very Special Spacecamp!! (opens the door and Chandler and Joey jump\nup, their apartment is decorated like outer space, one of the leather chairs is covered in\ntinfoil.)'
Sarah	 Really Mr. Geller, you don\xc2\x92t have to do this.'
Ross	 Oh come on! Here we go! (picks her up and puts her in the chair) Stand by\nfor mission countdown!'
Joey	 (simulating an echo) Ten, ten.., nine, nine, nine....,\neight, eight, eight... (Chandler hits him in the back of the head) Okay, Blast off!'
Chandler	 I\xc2\x92m an alien. I\xc2\x92m an alien.'
Ross	 Oh no! An asteroid! (throws the soccer ball off the back of Joey\xc2\x92s\nhead.)'
