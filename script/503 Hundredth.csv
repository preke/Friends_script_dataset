Phoebe	 (to the nurse) Hi.'
Nurse	 Hi.'
Phoebe	 Hi, yeah, hi! I'm umm, Phoebe Buffay, and I have babies coming out of\nme."
Nurse	 Okay. Have you started having contractions?'
Phoebe	 Not yet. Umm, I heard they really hurt, do they hurt?'
Nurse	 Well\xc2\x85'
Phoebe	 Oh my God!'
Ross	 It's all right."
Nurse	 Now, which of you is the father? (Points to Joey and Ross)'
Phoebe	 Oh no, none of them are the father. The father is my brother.'
Nurse	 (not sure what to do with that) Okay\xc2\x85'
Rachel	 I am so gonna miss watching you freak people out like that!'
Joey	 Okay, uh Pheebs, quick. Look! This (His video camera) is for the babies to\nlook at someday, so is-is there anything you want to say? Y'know before it all starts?"
Phoebe	 Oh, okay, umm, hi kids! Um, it's me, Aunt Phoebe. I can't wait to see\nyou. Please don't hurt me! "
Ross	 Hey, what took you guys so long? Your cab left when ours did!'
Monica	 Well, we-we had to go back because I forget my jacket.'
Chandler	 That's right."
Rachel	 You-you're not wearing a jacket."
Monica	 Oh man! I did it again!'
Phoebe	 (standing up) Okay, so umm, somebody has to call Frank and Alice. (As\nshe is talking Joey is sticking the camera under her skirt.) And then my mom wants to\nknow-(notices Joey)-Joey, what are you doing?!'
Joey	 I gotta get the before shot!'

Rachel	 Hi, Pheebs? Okay, so just spoke to the nurse and the reason that your\ndoctor is late is because uh, she's not coming."
Phoebe	 What?!'
Ross	 Apparently she fell in the shower and hit her head.'
Phoebe	 Oh my God, she's so stupid!"
Ross	 Look, Pheebs-Pheebs, it's gonna be okay."
Phoebe	 That's easy for you to say, I don't see three kids coming out your\nvagina!"
Rachel	 Honey, listen, y'know what? The nurse said the doctor is wonderful."
Ross	 Yeah, he's head of the department."
Phoebe	 All right\xc2\x97Ooh! Oh dead God, save me! '
Monica	 What?'
Phoebe	 I'm having my first contraction!"
Chandler	 Oh no.'
Phoebe	 Ooh, it's not bad."
Chandler	 Okay.'
Joey	 Oh! (In an announcer type voice) And so the miracle of life begins, and\naaiiyyyeeee! (He grabs his side and doubles over in pain.)'
Chandler	 Hey! You okay?'
Joey	 Ooh, something hurts!'
Phoebe	 Ooh, it's sympathy pains. Ohh, that's so sweet!"
Joey	 Are they? I didn't know I cared that much."
Ross	 Hello.'
Dr. Harad	 Hi! Phoebe, I'm Dr. Harad, I'm going to be delivering your babies. I\nwant you to know, you're gonna be in good hands. I've been doing this for a long time.\nI'll be back in a minute to do your internal, in the meantime, just relax because\neverything here looks great. And also, I love Fonzie. (Exits)"
Chandler	 Did he just say, he loves Fonzie?'
Monica	 That's what it sounded like."
Chandler	 All right\xc2\x85'
Frank	 (entering) Hey!'
All	 Hey!'
Frank	 (To Phoebe) Hey! Am I late? Am I late? Nobody came out yet, right?'
Phoebe	 No-no-no! We haven't started yet. Where's Alice?"
Frank	 Uh, Delaware. She's on her way though, so until she gets here, I'm gonna\nbe your coach. But don't worry, she told me all about the la-Mazada stuff."
Chandler	 Yeah, that's when if you get the babies out by the end of the month,\nthey give you 2% financing."
Frank	 Yeah.'
Rachel	 (entering) Monica? You gonna be very proud of me. I just got us dates\nwith two unbelievably cute nurses.'
Joey	 Oh my!'
Rachel	 They're male nurses."
Joey	 Not in my head.'
Rachel	 Anyway, they want to take us out Saturday night! What do you say?'
Monica	 Umm. (Looks at Chandler who is using the phone.) Umm. Umm. I don't think\nso."
Rachel	 What? What are you talking about?! You-you're the one who's been telling\nme to get over Ross and move on. I'm moving on, and you're moving on with me. Come on,\ngive me one good reason why you don't wanna go."
Monica	 Umm, why don't you give me something that would be a good reason\nand-and then I'll tell you if it's true."
Rachel	 What?'
Monica	 Harder than it sounds. Isn't it?"
Rachel	 Okay, you're coming with me, and I also told them that if we're still\nhere when they get off that we'll go down to the cafeteria and have some Jell-O\nwith them."
Joey	 (in a sexy voice) Yep! There's always room for Jell-O\xc2\x85"
Rachel	 Joey, how do you make that dirty?'
Joey	 Oh, it's easy. Yeah, I-I can do it with anything. Watch uh, (snaps his\nfingers and in a sexy voice) Grandma's chicken salad\xc2\x85"
Joey	 (entering) Ross! Get a shot of this. (He's carrying an issue of the USA\nToday and hands Ross the camera.) Hey babies! These are the headlines on the day you\nwere born! Okay, now girl baby turn away and boy babies\xc2\x85 (Throws the paper away to\nreveal a copy of Playpen, which is the TV version of Playboy Magazine.) Check it\nout, huh?! This is what naked women looked like the month you were born. All right, now\nlet's dive right into the good stuff. (Joey opens the magazine and Ross sticks the camera\nin it.)"
Phoebe	 Oh, okay, I'm having another one! This one doesn't hurt either\xc2\x97Ooh,\nyes it does! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ooh! (Checks under the blanket.) Oh, I was kinda hoping that\nwas it."
Ross	 Hey, where are Monica and Rachel anyway?'
Joey	 Oh, a couple of nurses asked them out. Maybe they're with them."
Chandler	 Really? Male nurses?'
Joey	 Yeah, I was bummed too.'
Chandler	 So they're going on dates? When?"
Joey	 I think Saturday\xc2\x97(groans in pain again).'
Frank	 (To Phoebe) What's with him?"
Phoebe	 Umm, sympathy pains. I thought it was really sweet at first, but now I\nthink he's just trying to steal my thunder."
Dr. Harad	 (entering) Okay!'
Phoebe	 Hey.'
Dr. Harad	 Let's see what we got here. Ohh, y'know, Fonzie dated triplets."
Chandler	 This-this Fonzie person you keep referring too, is that uh, is that\nanother doctor?'
Dr. Harad	 Oh no-no-no. Fonzie is the nickname of Arthur Fonzerelli. The Fonz.'
Chandler	 All right.'
Frank	 It's not that weird, is it?"
Phoebe	 It's very weird! I don't want some guy down there telling me, I'm\ny'know, dilatedamundo!"
Ross	 To be fair, he doesn\xc2\x92t seem to be impersonating Fonzie\xc2\x85'
Phoebe	 (interrupting) What are you doing?!! Why are you defending him?! Just\nget me another doctor! One who is not crazy and who is not Fonzie!'
Ross	 Again, it's not that he\xc2\x85"
Chandler	 (spotting her) Oh-hey-hey-hey! There you are!'
Monica	 Umm, listen there's something I think you should know."
Chandler	 Oh, is this about you-you dating the nurse? Yeah, Joey already told\nme, and I am so-so fine. I mean, you and I we're just, y'know, we're nothing, we're\ngoofin' around."
Monica	 Umm, actually I was about to tell you that I was, I was going to get out\nof it, but hey, if we're just goofing around then uh, maybe I will go out with him."
Chandler	 Fine! Maybe I will too!'
Joey	 (entering from the elevator caring gifts for the kids) Hey, you guys! Look\nwhat I found in the giiiiiiift shop. (He doubles over in pain in front an old man in a\nwheel chair.) Get up! Get up! Get up! (The old man waves him away.)'
Ross	 Okay, Phoebe, this Dr. Oberman. He has no strong feelings about Fonzie or\nany of the Happy Days gang.'
Phoebe	 Hi! And you're going into what grade?"
Dr. Oberman	 Umm, I'm actually a first year resident, but I get that a lot, you\nsee, I-I graduated early\xc2\x85"
Phoebe	 (interrupting) Uh-huh, me too. Ross, maybe I should've specified that\nI'd be needing a grown up doctor. "
Dr. Oberman	 Oh no, I'm fully qualified to\xc2\x85"
Phoebe	 Shh! Doogie, shh! Doesn't anybody understand that I'm gonna be having\nbabies soon? Huh? Go! Go little boy, go!"
Frank	 Oh cool! You made him cry!'
Joey's Doctor	 Mr. Tribbiani, I'm afraid you've got kidney stones."
Joey	 Umm, well, what else could it be?'
Joey's Doctor	 It's kidney stones."
Joey	 Or?'
Joey's Doctor	 Kidney stones!"
Dr. Harad	 All right, you're getting there. Oh, and y'know, these babies are\nvery, very lucky."
Phoebe	 They are. Why?'
Dr. Harad	 They have the honor of being born on The Fonz's half-birthday."
Phoebe	 Happy birthday!'
Dr. Harad	 Just-just to clarify, I'm not Fonzie. (Phoebe nods in agreement as he\nleaves.)"
Rachel	 Honey, y'know I just gotta tell you, I think this is such a terrific\nthing you're having these babies for Frank and Alice."
Phoebe	 I know, it is.'
Rachel	 Yeah!'
Phoebe	 Can I tell you a little secret?'
Rachel	 Yeah!'
Phoebe	 I want to keep one. (Giggles in excitement.)'
Rachel	 Ohh, I'm gonna be on the news!"

Rachel	 Okay, Phoebe, honey, you gotta be kidding. I mean, you know you\ncannot keep one of these babies!'
Phoebe	 Why not?! Maybe I can, you don't know!"
Rachel	 Yes! Yes! Yes, I do! I do know! Frank and Alice are gonna want to keep all\nof their children!'
Phoebe	 Maybe not! Y'know? Seriously, three babies are a handful maybe they're\ny'know, looking for a chance to unload one of them. Listen, I-I hate to miss an\nopportunity just because I didn't ask! Y'know?"
Rachel	 Phoebe, no! This is, this is insane.'
Phoebe	 Oh, just ask him!'
Rachel	 Me?!'
Phoebe	 I can't ask him! Do you have any idea how inappropriate that\nwould be?! All I'm saying is just talk to Frank. Okay? Just, y'know, feel him out!"
Rachel	 No! Forget it! I am not gonna ask Frank to give you one of his\nkids!!'
Phoebe	 You're right. "
Phoebe	 Tell him it's for you."
Monica	 Feeling a little better sweetie?'
Joey	 Well, maybe a little. I wish you hadn't seen me throw up."
Monica	 Me too.'
Ross	 (entering) Hey! I just heard. What's up?"
Joey's Doctor	 Kidney stones! Now, ordinarily Mr. Tribbiani, we try to break up\nthe stones up with shock waves, but they're to close to the bladder now. Which means we\ncan either wait for you to pass them or else go up the urethra\xc2\x85"
Joey	 (interrupting) Whoa-whoa! No-no-no-no-no, nothing is going up! Okay? Up,\nup is not an option\xc2\x97what's a urethra? (Monica whispers what it is in his ear.) Are\nyou crazy?!"
Phoebe	 (To Rachel) So did you ask him?'
Rachel	 No, I haven't had a chance to be alone with him yet."
Phoebe	 Well, I'm kinda on a clock here."
Dr. Harad	 (laughing) Oh Fonzie.'
Rachel	 Y'know who I always liked? Mork."
Phoebe	 Undo it. Undo it. Undo it.'
Dr. Harad	 Fonzie met Mork. Mork froze Fonzie.'
Rachel	 Yeah, but umm\xc2\x85 Yes, but, Fonzie was already cool, so he wasn't\nhurt, right?"
Dr. Harad	 Yeah, that's right."
Monica	 (entering with Chandler) Hey!'
Phoebe	 Hi!'
Monica	 (To Phoebe) How are you doing?'
Phoebe	 Okay, doctor says any minute now.'
Frank	 Hey, y'know, Alice is gonna be here so soon, you couldn't just like do me\na favor and like, like hold them in?"
Phoebe	 Sorry Frank, I'm kinda in the middle of the last favor you asked me to\ndo."
Male Nurse	 Hey!'
Rachel	 Hi!'
Male Nurse	 Rachel.'
Rachel	 Monica, this is Dan (points to him), one of the guys that we\'re gonna be\ngoing out with on Saturday. (Mouths "He\'s yours." to her.) Uh Dan, Monica.'
Dan	 Nice to meet you.'
Monica	 Hello Dan! I'm really looking forward to Saturday night! Really,\nreally!"
Chandler	 So Dan, nurse not a doctor huh? Kinda girlie isn't it?"
Monica	 Chandler!'
Dan	 Nah that's okay. I'm just doing this to put myself through medical school."
Chandler	 Oh.'
Dan	 And it didn't feel so girlie during the Gulf War."
Chandler	 Sure. (Pause) And listen, thanks for doing that for us, by the way.\n(Retreats in defeat.)'
Monica	 So, why wait 'til Saturday, are you free tomorrow?"
Dan	 Sure! I'll get somebody to cover my shift."
Monica	 Oh, great!'

Rachel	 Oh, honey, don\xc2\x92t worry. She's gonna make it on time."
Frank	 Yeah.'
Rachel	 Yeah. So Frank, three babies. Whew, that just seems like a lot, huh?'
Frank	 (laughs) Not to me.'
Rachel	 Yeah, fair enough.'
Dr. Harad	 Okay, you're at ten centimeters. Time to start having some babies.\nAll right, I want only the father in here please."
Monica	 Bye Dan!'
Dan	 Uh, bye Monica.'
Chandler	 Bye, momi-moo.'
Dr. Harad	 All right, I need a clamp, sterile towel, and channel 31.'
Phoebe	 What is that?'
Phoebe	 Oh my God!'
Dr. Harad	 Oh, no-no-no, it's a good one! Fonzie plays the bongos. All right,\nare you ready? It's time to start pushing."
Joey's Doctor	 Are you ready? It's time to try peeing. (Joey makes a face like\nhe is trying to pee.) Wait-wait-wait-wait-wait! It's almost time to try peeing.\n(Points at the bottle Joey is to pee into.)"
Dr. Harad	 Okay, now push! That's it push! Just concentrate on pushing! Yeah,\nhere we go!"
Dan	 I see the head.'
Frank	 Yes, it has a head! '
Dr. Harad	 All right. Keep pushing! Come on!'
Frank	 I can't believe there's somebody coming out of you right now. There's\nsomebody coming out of you! Is it? Is it? It's my son."

Phoebe	 I already had a baby. Leave me alone.'
Frank	 Okay, okay, come on, you can do it. You can do it!'
Frank	 Yeah!! Little Leslie is here! We got another one! Oh my God, I can't\nbelieve I have two-two children. How scary is that? (He returns to the delivery room.)"
Frank	 Come on little Chandler, it's time to be born. Come on little Chandler!\nCome on!"
Dr. Harad	 All right, he's coming. He's coming!"
Frank	 Hey, where's his thing?"
Frank	 Chandler's a girl!"

Frank	 They musta read the sonogram wrong. 'Cause they, 'cause they thought it\nwas a boy, but Chandler's a girl! Chandler's a girl!"
Chandler	 Okay, keep saying it!'
Alice	 (running in from the elevator) Am I too late?!'
Frank	 No-no ah, everything's okay. Everybody's healthy there's 30 fingers and\n30 toes."
Alice	 We have our babies?'
Frank	 Yeah.'
Alice	 (Starting to cry) Oh, we have our babies.'
Joey	 Oh my God.'
Ross	 You did it, man.'
Joey's Doctor	 Would you like to see them? (He hands Joey a little jar.)"
Joey	 They're so small! (Both he and Ross look at them with satisfied looks on\ntheir faces.)"
Dan	 So, I'll call you tomorrow."
Monica	 Great!'
Chandler	 So, are you really gonna go out with that nurse man?'
Monica	 Well uh, you and I are just goofing around, I thought, why not goof\naround with him.'
Chandler	 Y'know, I don't know if you've ever looked up the term goofing around\nin the dictionary\xc2\x85 Well, I have, and the technical definition is, two friends who\ncare a lot about each other and have amazing sex and just wanna spend more time together.\nBut if you have this new fangled dictionary that gets you made at me, then we have to,\ny'know, get you my original dictionary. I am so bad at this."
Monica	 I think you're better than you think you are."
Chandler	 Really? Okay, so\xc2\x85'
Monica	 (interrupting) Know when to stop.'
Chandler	 Y'know, I sensed that I should stop. So we're okay?"
Monica	 Yeah. All right, I'm gonna go tell Dan that it's not gonna happen. (They\nkiss and as she starts to leave, Chandler starts to dance. Without turning around.) Don't\ndo the dance."
Chandler	 Right!'
Monica	 I think you're my favorite."
Phoebe	 Which one do you have?'
Monica	 I don't care."
Rachel	 (entering) Hi. (To Phoebe) Hey, hi! So uh, Frank and Alice wanted me to\ntell you that they're still outside making phone calls."
Phoebe	 But umm, I mean, did you talk to them about, y'know\xc2\x85"
Rachel	 Yeah, umm, no honey.'
Phoebe	 Oh. It was a long shot. Hey, you guys can I just like have a second\nalone with the babies.'
All	 Yeah, sure yeah. Yeah.'
Phoebe	 So, here you are. It seems like yesterday I was talking to you in that\nlittle petri dish. Everyone said labor was the hardest thing I'd ever have to do, but they\nwere wrong this is. Oh, I had the most fun with you guys! I wish I could take you home and\nsee you everyday. Okay, I'll settle for being your favorite Aunt. I know Alice's sister\nhas a pool, but you lived in me. Okay, so we're cool. Yeah, we're gonna be great. Little\nhigh fives! (Imitates the high fives.) Ahh! Ahh! Ahh! (One of the babies begins to cry.)\nWell, if you're gonna cry. (She starts crying.)"

Monica	 Phoebe, we are so proud of you! You're amazing!"
Phoebe	 I know.'
Rachel	 So does it really hurt as bad as they say?'
Phoebe	 Yeah. You won't be able to take it."
Chandler	 So uh, now that little Chandler turned out to be a girl, what are they\ngonna name her?'
Phoebe	 They're gonna call her Chandler."
Chandler	 That's kind of a masculine name, don't you think?"
Phoebe	 Works on you.'
