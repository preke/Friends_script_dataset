Joey	 (entering) Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!! None of that, not while you're living\nunder my roof!"
Monica	 What?!'
Joey	 Look, just because I know about you two, doesn't mean I like\nlooking at it."
Chandler	 Aren't you supposed to be at an audition for another hour?"
Joey	 Well, I'm sorry if I'm not a middle-aged black woman! (Starts for his\nroom.) And I'm also sorry if sometimes I go to the wrong audition! Okay, look, if I\nhave to pretend I don't know about you two, then you two are gonna have to pretend there's\nnothing to know about."
Chandler and Monica	 Okay.'
Monica	 Sorry.'
Chandler	 Sorry.'
Joey	 (from the bedroom) I can hear that!'
Monica	 (To Chandler) Rachel's at work."
Joey	 I can still hear you!'

Phoebe	 Hey!'
Joey	 Hey!'
Chandler	 Hello!'
Monica	 Hey, what's that?"
Phoebe	 Yeah, my mom sent me a family heirloom that once belonged to my\ngrandmother. Can you believe it?! A year ago I didn't even have a family, and now I have\nheirlooms for crying out loud."
Phoebe	 Eeeee-(She opens the box and removes its contents and sees that it's a\nfur coat.)-ohh!! God! (She throws it at Joey.)"
Joey	 Argh-argh!! (Catches the coat.) Ooh, soft. Is this mink?'
Phoebe	 Yeah! Why would my mother send me a fur? Doesn't she know me but\nat all! Plus, I have a perfectly fine coat that no innocent animal suffered to make!"
Chandler	 Yeah, just some 9-year-old Filipino kids who worked their fingers\nbloody for 12 cents an hour. (Phoebe stares at him wide-eyed. Chandler sees her reaction.)\nThat didn't happen, I made that up!"
Ross	 (entering) Hey!'
Gunther	 Oh, Ross? Ross! You can't put up flyers in here."
Ross	 How come? Everybody else does.'
Gunther	 You can't."
Monica	 What is that?'
Ross	 Oh, umm, I'm just getting rid of a couple of things."
Monica	 (looking at the flyer) This is all of your things.'
Ross	 Yes, yes it is! No, but it's good it's\xc2\x97Emily thinks we should get all\nnew stuff. Stuff that's just ours, together. Y'know brand new."
Monica	 So basically, this is a getting-rid-of-everything-Rachel-ever-used sale.'
Ross	 Touched. Used. Sat on. Sleep on.'
Gunther	 I'll take it all."
Joey	 Hey, Ross, you're okay with that?"
Ross	 Look, if I can just do what Emily wants and get her to New York,\nI'm sure everything will be fine."
Chandler	 Okay, but don't you think this is a little extreme?"
Ross	 After what I did? Can you blame her?'
Phoebe	 Oh my God! You got off easy! When my friend Silvie's husband said\nsomeone else's name in bed, she cursed him and turned his thingy green."
Joey	 (after Ross is gone) What is he doing? What, Emily, thinks Ross's\nfurniture has got Rachel coodies?"
Monica	 Now calm down Joey.'
Joey	 No! Everything's gettin' all messed up, y'know? Emily won't let Ross see\nRachel, we're not gonna stop seeing Rachel, hence Ross stops seeing us!"
Phoebe	 Oh, I hate this. Everything's changing."
Chandler	 Yeah I know, we're losing Ross, Joey said hence\xc2\x85"
Monica	 Look, I'm not happy about this either, but y'know if-if Ross says he's\nhappy then we're just gonna have to keep our feelings about Emily to ourselves. Are you\ncool with that?"
Joey	 No! But y'know, I'm an actor, I'll act cool."
Rachel	 Ohh, whoa God! Storage rooms give me the creeps! Monica, come on please\nhurry up honey! Please? '
Monica	 Rachel, if you want the little round waffles, you gotta have to wait\nuntil I find the little waffle iron.'
Rachel	 I want the little round waffles.'
Monica	 All right. (Looking through a box.) Op, here it is! Right underneath the\ncan of-of bug bomb. I wonder if the best place to put something that cooks food is\nunderneath the can of poison?'
Rachel	 Okay, y'know what? I'll-I'll have toast!"
Rachel	 Arghhhh!!!!!!'
Monica	 Oh my God! Fog him! Fog him!'
Phoebe	 I don't know what I'm gonna do about this coat."
Joey	 I'll take it!"
Phoebe	 That might work! (She gives him the coat.)'
Joey	 Ooh-ooh-ooh, yeah! (He drapes it around his shoulders.) Enh? All right,\nwhat do you think?'
Chandler	 You're on in 5 Ms. Minnelli. "
Ross	 (on the phone) No-no-no, it's just a bit sudden. (Listens) No, it's great.\nOkay? I'm totally on board. I love you too, all righty. Bye. (Hangs up.)"
Joey	 What's the matter Ross?"
Ross	 Nothing. Oh, actually, great news! I just got off the phone with Emily and\nit looks like I'm moving to a new apartment. Woo-hoo!"
Phoebe	 Why?'
Ross	 Well, her thought is, and I agree, fresh new furniture, why not a fresh\nnew apartment? Her cousin has this great place to sublet, it's got a view of the river on\none side and Columbia on the other."
Joey	 That's way uptown! That's like three trains away! (Phoebe pinches him.)\nWhich is great! I love to ride that rail!"
Chandler	 So you're really okay with this?"
Ross	 Yes! Yes! I mean it's-it's kinda far from work, but uh, y'know, I'll get\nso much done on the commute. I-I've been given the gift of time!"
Chandler	 Now that's so funny, because last Christmas I got the gift of space.\nWe should get them together and make a continuum."
Joey	 Now he's movin'? Man, what is Emily doing to him? (Phoebe pinches him\nagain.) Ow!! He's not even here!!!"
Rachel	 You guys! You guys!'
Monica	 We were, we were just in the storage area and we saw this really creepy\nman!'
Rachel	 It was like this crazy-eyed, hairy beast man! He was like a, like a\nbigfoot or a yeti or something!'
Monica	 And he came at us with an axe, so Rachel had to use a bug bomb on him!'
Rachel	 (proud of herself) Yeah, I-I-I just pulled the tab and I just fogged his\nyeti ass!'
Joey	 Uhh, like dark hair, bushy beard?'
Rachel	 Yeah!'
Joey	 Yeah, you fogged Danny.'
Rachel	 Please! We did not fog Danny! Who's Danny?"
Joey	 Dan just moved in downstairs. Yeah, he just got back from like this\nfour-month trek in the Andes. Nice fella. '
Monica	 Oh he's nice. He's nice! Y'know, you always stick up for the people we\nfog!"
Danny	 Yeah?'
Rachel	 Hi! You might not remember us, but we are the girls that fogged\nyou.'
Monica	 We're-we're really sorry we fogged you."
Danny	 Okay. '
Rachel	 Hi! Just so you know, we-we didn't mean to fog you, we thought\nyou were like a yeti or something."
Danny	 Okay.'
Danny	 Yesss?'
Rachel	 Hi! Sorry to bother you, but I don't think we can accept your\nacceptance of our apology, it just doesn't really seem like you mean it."
Monica	 Yeah.'
Danny	 O-kay!'
Monica	 Wow! That guy is so rude!'
Rachel	 Really! What is with that guy? I mean you'd forgive me if I fogged you."
Monica	 Well you did a little bit.'
Rachel	 Oh my God, honey, I'm so sorry!"
Monica	 I totally forgive you!'
Rachel	 Really?'
Monica	 Yes!'
Phoebe	 Hey!'
Monica	 Hey!'
Phoebe	 So listen, you know my friend Chris who owns the crematorium? '
Monica	 Crematorium Chris? Sure!'
Phoebe	 He says, that he would cremate my fur coat for free if I umm, y'know,\nbring in the next person I know who dies."
Rachel	 Oh my God! Oh my God, look at these pelts!'
Monica	 Don't get too attached, she's having it cremated."
Rachel	 What? Uhh, Phoebe, honey, honey, I know you're quirky and I get a big\nkick out of it, we all do actually, but if you destroy a coat like this that is like a\ncrime against nature! Not nature, fashion!"
Phoebe	 This is fashion?! (Grabs the coat from Rachel.) Okay, so to you, death\nis fashion?! That's really funny. (She puts the coat on and starts to model it.) Here's\nPhoebe umm, sporting uh, y'know, cutting edge hairy carcass from y'know, the steal traps\nof wintry Russia. I mean, you really thing this looks good? (Sees herself in the\nmirror.) 'Cause I do."
Ross	 (on phone) I know I miss you too. I can't wait to see you. I love you.\nBye. (Hangs up.)"
Chandler	 Okay, what is in here? Rocks?'
Ross	 No-no, this is my collection of fossil samples.'
Chandler	 So, rocks. '
Ross	 I'm really gonna miss this apartment. Y'know, Ben-Ben took his first steps\nright over there. (Points.)"
Joey	 Ohh. Hey, remember when I ran into this thing (The shutters that close off\nthe kitchen.) and it kinda knocked me out a little?'
Ross	 I loved this place! To tell you the truth, I wish I didn't have to move."
Joey	 Uhh, are you saying that you're not entirely happy about this?"
Ross	 Well, I mean if uh, if Emily gave me a choice\xc2\x85'
Joey	 You do have a choice!! Ross, why are you listening to her?! Are\nyou, are you crazy?!'
Ross	 Why?'
Joey	 It's not right what Emily wants you to do! She is totally-(The gang enters\nbehind Joey and Phoebe pinches him again.)-Owww!! Stop pinching me! Look, now you guys\nsaid I only had to keep my mouth shut as long as Ross was happy, right? Well he just told\nme that he's not entirely happy."
Ross	 What's going on?"
Joey	 We all hate Emily!'
Phoebe	 Nooo!!'
Monica	 No, Ross, we do not hate Emily. We-we just, we just think that you're\nhaving to sacrifice a whole lot to make her happy."
Joey	 Yeah!'
Chandler	 Look, we just think that maybe she's being a little unreasonable."
Joey	 Yes! Yes! Unreasonable!'
Ross	 Unreasonable? How about we have this conversation when one of you guys\ngets married! You have no idea what it takes to make a marriage work! All right,\nit's about compromise! Do you always like it? No! Do you do it? Yes! Because it's not all\nlaughing, happy, candy in the sky, drinking coffee at Central Perk all the time! It's real\nlife, okay? It's what grown-ups do! (He storms out.)"
Phoebe	 I think he's right. You guys hang out at the coffeehouse way too much."

Monica	 God, I feel so guilty about Ross.'
Phoebe	 Oh, I know.'
Joey	 I kinda feel like it's my fault."
Chandler	 Kind of? If you just kept this to yourself none of this would've\nhappened."
Joey	 Well, I'm keeping so many things to myself these days, something was bound\nto slip out! (He glares at Chandler.)"
Chandler	 Well, I think it's very brave what you said."
Phoebe	 All right, I can't sit here anymore. I have to walk places. (She puts on\nher fur coat.)"
Chandler	 Pheebs, what are you doing with the coat? How about the whole animal\nrights thing?'
Phoebe	 Well, I've been reading up and for your information, minks are not very\nnice. Okay, I admit it! I love this coat! Okay, I\xc2\x97it's the best thing I've ever had\nwrapped around me, including Phil Huntley! (She starts to leave but stops and says to\nMonica.) Remember Phil Huntley? He was fine!"
Rachel	 Hi!'
Danny	 So you like the short hair better.'
Rachel	 What? Yeti\xc2\x97I mean Danny?'
Danny	 I had to cut my hair to get rid of the uh, fogger smell.'
Rachel	 Oh. Listen, I'm so sorry. I would, I would've never fogged you if y'know\nif you hadn't looked so\xc2\x85. Y'know."
Danny	 Absolutely. Some people are just into appearances.'
Rachel	 (shocked) What?'
Danny	 That's cool. Cool. (Starts to leave.)"
Rachel	 What? Hey! No-no-no! This not cool! You don't even know me!"
Danny	 Come on, you got the shopping bags and the Sack's catalog. "
Rachel	 So from that you think you've got me all figured out? Well, you don't!\nY'know I-I could have toys for underprivileged kids in here!"
Danny	 Do you?'
Rachel	 Well, y'know, if-if kids like to play with Capri pants."
Danny	 Okay. (Heads for his apartment.)'
Rachel	 And stop saying that! I hate that!'
Danny	 Okay!'
Rachel	 Fine! I judged you. I made a snap judgement. But you did it too! And you\nare worse because you are sticking to your stupid snap judgement! You can't even open up\nyour mind for a second to see if you're wrong! What does that say about you?"
Danny	 The pizza-place across the street any good?'
Rachel	 What?!'
Danny	 I'm hungry. Wanna get some pizza? You can keep yelling if there's more."
Rachel	 Okay. Okay.'
Danny	 Stop saying that. I hate that.'
Chandler	 Uh, Ross?'
Phoebe	 Are you still mad at us?'
Ross	 Yep.'
Phoebe	 Oh good! Because we have an "I\'m sorry" song.'
Ross	 Y'know what? I'm really not in the mood."
Joey	 Look, Ross, I feel really bad. I mean, you're going through all this stuff\nand I just acted like a jerk."
Chandler	 Yeah, we are so sorry.'
Phoebe	 (To Chandler) You're kinda stepping on the song. (She gets ready to play\nbut is stopped by\xc2\x85)"
Joey	 Look, we were way out of line, we totally support you.'
Monica	 Whatever you decide, whatever you do.'
Phoebe	 Okay, now you're just taking lines right out of the song!"
Ross	 Look, this is hard enough! I really need you guys right now.'
Phoebe	 Yes! Exactly! And that's why\xc2\x85"
Monica	 Why don't you come over tonight? And I'll make you favorite dinner."
Ross	 Okay. Thanks you guys. Pheebs are you wearing fur?'
Phoebe	 Okay, let's get some perspective people; it's not like I'm wearing a\nseeing-eye dog coat!"
Joey	 Hey, y'know Ross, I think I kinda understand why I kinda lost it today."
Ross	 You do, huh?'
Joey	 Yeah you see umm, well, I'm an actor. Right? So I gotta keep my emotions\nright at the surface y'know? See what I'm saying? I gotta lot of balls in the air. (Makes\nlike he's juggling.) Y'know what I mean? It's tough! Guys like me, y'know, you wander\naround, you're alone\xc2\x85"
Ross	 What are you talking about?'
Joey	 (thinks) I'm not sure."
Rachel	 (entering) Hi!'
Monica	 Hey, look at you! Where have you been?'
Rachel	 Oh, I went to have pizza. With Danny.'
Monica	 How did that happen?'
Rachel	 That yeti is one smooth talker.'
Monica	 I hope you're not full, 'cause dinner's almost ready."
Rachel	 Yeah, y'know I-I think I'm just gonna hang out in my room."
All	 No! Why?'
Rachel	 Come on you guys! Listen, if Emily knew I was here having dinner you\nwith you she would flip out and you know it. It's okay, I really\xc2\x85 I don't mind."
Ross	 Wait! Wait! Wait! Y'know what? Just stay. Please? It uh\xc2\x85 It would\nreally mean a lot to me if you stayed."
Rachel	 Ross, I\xc2\x85'
Joey	 RACHEL PLEASE!!! JUST HAVE DINNER WITH US!!!'
Rachel	 Okay. Okay. Joey, it's okay. Settle down."
Joey	 All right, I-I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You see Rach I'm an actor\xc2\x85"
Ross	 Hey! Hey, look! Ugly Naked Guy's back!"
Rachel	 I haven't seen him in so long!"
Phoebe	 Oh God, I really missed that fat bastard!'
Monica	 Wow, this is so weird. I just realized this might be the last time we'll\nall be hanging out together."
Joey	 It's almost as if he knew."
Monica	 I'll get it. (On phone.) Hello. (Listens.) Hi Emily! (Listens.) Yeah, uh\nyou-you tracked him down. Hold on one second. (She hands the phone to Ross.)"
Ross	 Hey! (Listens.) Yeah-yeah, we're just having dinner. (Listens.) Uh, yeah,\nsure uh hold on. (To the gang.) She wants to say hi. (To Emily) Hold on."
Phoebe	 Hi Emily!'
Chandler	 Hi!'
Emily	 Hello everyone. So who am I saying hello too?'
Joey	 Well uh, I don't know about who's here, but I can tell you for damn sure\nwho's not here and that's Rachel!!"
Emily	 (laughs) Well, I should hope not. Ross knows better than that by now.'
Ross	 Y'know what? Uh, Rachel is here! (Rachel stops.)"
Emily	 She's there?!"
Chandler	 Oh yeah, there-there she is!'
Ross	 Yeah, yeah, she's here."
Emily	 Ross, take me off speakerphone.'
Ross	 (on phone) Hi.'
Emily	 How can you do this too me?! I thought I'd made my feelings about Rachel\nperfectly clear!"
Ross	 (going onto the patio) Look Emily, I'm just having dinner with my friends,\nokay?"
Emily	 You obviously can't keep away from her."
Ross	 Emily that's ridiculous. Look, I'm-I'm moving for you, I'm cutting friends\nout of my life for you. Please, just get on the plane and come to New York. Okay, you'll\nsee you're the only person I want to be with."
Emily	 I'll feel better when I'm there, and I can know where you are all the\ntime."
Ross	 Well, you can't know where I am all the time. Look, this marriage is never\ngonna work if you don't trust me."
Emily	 You're right."
Ross	 So, can you trust me?'
Emily	 No.'
Joey	 I think it's going okay. Looks like he's smiling."
Monica	 How can you tell? You can only see the back of his head!'
Joey	 You can totally tell! Here look, watch me. (He stands up and turns his\nback to them so that he is facing the window.) Smile! Frown. Smile! Frown. (The camera\ncuts to Ross outside hanging up the phone.) Smile! (Ross turns around and sees Joey\nalternately smiling and frowning and just stares at him for a second and heads back\ninside.)'
Ross	 Well, I guess that's it."
All	 Why, what happened?'
Joey	 What happened? What happened?'
Ross	 My marriage is over.'
All	 What?!'
Monica	 Oh, sweetie. Oh, look at you. You're shivering."
Phoebe	 Here. (She wraps her coat around his shoulders.)'
Rachel	 Ross, honey, is there anything we can do?'
Ross	 Yeah. You can help me get my furniture back from Gunther.'

Phoebe	 (to the squirrel) Okay, stop tormenting me! This mink! Okay, they're\nmean! And they hate squirrels! And y'know, okay, most of these probably wanted to be\ncoats! (The squirrel stares at her.) All right, fine, now I get it. (To the clerk.) Here.\n(She hands him her coat.) You take it. (To the squirrel.) Are you happy now? I'm cold!"
