Chandler	 Do you think that there\xc2\x92s a town in Missouri or some place called\nSample? And ah, as you\xc2\x92re driving into town there\xc2\x92s-there\xc2\x92s like a sign,\nand it says \xc2\x93You\xc2\x92re in Sample.\xc2\x94 (He says it like urine sample.)'
Monica	 (entering) Hey.'
All	 Hey! '

Billy	 How do you know?'
Robin	 Well y'know, he\xc2\x92s got access."
Billy	 Yeah.'
Robin	 Y'know it\xc2\x92s that feeling you get, y'know?"
Billy	 Like when you go bowling and you know you\xc2\x92re in somebody else\xc2\x92s\nshoes?'
Robin	 That\xc2\x92s the one.'
Phoebe	 All right, so, so you went to Pete\xc2\x92s...'
Ross	 What happened?'
Monica	 (Robin is speaking loudly again) I...'
Robin	 Why is this happening to me?! I don\xc2\x92t know, maybe it\xc2\x92s my\nwound.'
Monica	 Forget it. (they all turn and listen to Billy and Robin)'
Billy	 So it\xc2\x92s-it\xc2\x92s not heeled yet?'
Robin	 No-no, it\xc2\x92s ooozing, oozing. (to Rachel) Could you pass me the\ncream? Is there any\xc2\x97Oh, there\xc2\x92s the cream.'
Billy	 Thomas, this is gonna be hard, but I wanted it to come from me, and\nnobody else.'
Robin	 What is it, Tim?'
Billy	 It\xc2\x92s me, I\xc2\x92ve been sleeping with your wife.'
Joey	 (to Billy) So you\xc2\x92re the gynaecologist?'
Billy	 (to Joey) Hey, I\xc2\x92m trying to have a private conversation! Is that\nokay?!'
Robin	 (starting to cry) Ooh, (to Rachel) Can I have a napkin, please? Could you\nplease hand me a napkin? (Rachel tries to grab one, but is to slow for his tastes.) Would\nyou--Give me this thing (grabs the napkin holder from her.) all right!! Enough! (to Billy)\nAnd you are no longer my friend! We are finished! (gets up to leave) Nada!! No more! You\nare a bastard for doing this!! (Billy follows him) Get away from me!!'
Billy	 Thomas, come back here! (they both leave)'
Phoebe	 So Monica, what were you gonna tell us?'
Monica	 (pause) I have no idea.'

Rachel	 So, come on, what was the big news Pete wanted to tell you Mon?! Or\nshould I say Mrs. Monica Becker?'
Phoebe	 No-no-no oh, keep your name, don\xc2\x92t take his name.'
Monica	 He didn\xc2\x92t ask me to marry him.'
All	 Ohh.'
Phoebe	 Well then definately don\xc2\x92t take his name.'
Monica	 He wanted to tell me he\xc2\x92s gonna compete is some ultimate fighting\ncompetition thingy.'
The Guys	 Pete?!'
Rachel	 Why?! What is it?'
Monica	 I don\xc2\x92t know exactly. It\xc2\x92s-it\xc2\x92s sorta like wrestling.'
Phoebe	 (intrigued) Oh?!'
Monica	 Yeah, but without the costumes.'
Phoebe	 (disappointed) Oh.'
Joey	 And it\xc2\x92s not fake, it\xc2\x92s totally brutal.'
Chandler	 Yeah, it\xc2\x92s two guys in a ring, and the rules are
Monica	 So you can like, bite, and pull people\xc2\x92s hair and stuff?'
Ross	 Yeah, anything goes, except ah, eye gouging and fish hooking.'
Monica	 What\xc2\x92s fish hooking?'
Ross	 Huh, what\xc2\x92s fish hooking... (Joey sticks his finger in Ross\xc2\x92s\nmouth and pulls on his cheek, y'know like when you hook a fish.) (to Joey, sarcastic)\nThanks man, that would have been really hard to describe. What is that taste?"
Joey	 What? My hands are totally clean, I just gave the duck a bath.'
Doug	 So thanks for the warm welcome. It\xc2\x92s good to have you guys on my\nteam, and I come to play. I hope you do too. Now, let\xc2\x92s go out there and get\n\xc2\x91em! Huh? And remember, there is no \xc2\x91I\xc2\x92 in team.'
Chandler	 Yes, but there\xc2\x92s two in martini, soo everybody back to my\noffice.'
Doug	 (to Chandler) You! Chuckles! What\xc2\x92s your name?'
Chandler	 Oh it\xc2\x92s Bing, sir. I\xc2\x92m sorry , I was just ah...'
Doug	 No-no, I heard what you said, funny. I like funny. (Chandler starts to\nleave) This team is about hard work, but it\xc2\x92s also about having fun. Good to have you\naboard Bing! (smacks him on the butt, and Chandler leaves shocked.)'
Ross	 (on phone) That\xc2\x92s right, Ryder. Wynona Ryder for six. (listens) Thank\nyou. (hangs up) (to the gang) Yeah, we have the reservations.'
Rachel	 Yes!!'
Chandler	 All right buddy, way to go! (smacks him on the butt)'
Ross	 (stunned) Dude, what are you doing?'
Chandler	 Thank you! Today, my boss keep slapping my butt and he was acting like\nit was no big deal.'
Phoebe	 Yeesh, what\xc2\x92d you do about it?'
Chandler	 Well, I didn\xc2\x92t do anything. I didn\xc2\x92t want to be the guy who\nhas a problem with his boss slapping his bottom.'
Monica	 I gotta tell ya, I think it\xc2\x92s okay to be that guy.'
Joey	 Yeah, maybe it\xc2\x92s like y'know, that jock thing. Y'know how football\nplayers pat each other after touchdowns. (pats Ross on the butt) "
Rachel	 Y'know I don\xc2\x92t, I don\xc2\x92t understand guys, I mean I-I would\nnever congratulate Monica on a great stew by y'know, grabbin\xc2\x92 her boob."
Chandler	 Yeah, I know, for a really great stew you just y'know, stick your head\nin between \xc2\x91em."
Monica	 Okay, can we please go eat?'
Joey	 Yeah. What are we getting?'
Monica	 (to Chandler) Anything but stew.'
Ross	 All right so, Chandler, from now on, don\xc2\x92t give your boss a chance to\nget you. Y'know just ah, don\xc2\x92t turn your back to him."
Joey	 Yeah, or you can teach him a lesson. Y'know? What you could do is you\ncould rub something that really smells on your butt, all right? Then, when he goes to\nsmack ya, his hand will smell. (thinking aloud) Now what could you rub on your butt that\nwould smell bad?"
Chandler	 (to Ross and Monica) What if Joey were president?'
Phoebe	 Umm, hey Rach, can I ask you something?'
Rachel	 Yeah.'
Phoebe	 Okay, you can totally say no, but umm, would it be okay with you if I\nset Ross up on a date?'
Rachel	 Oh, ah with who?'
Phoebe	 Umm, my friend, Bonnie. She just always thought Ross was really cute,\nand now that you two aren\xc2\x92t together, she asked if I could set it up, but if\nyou\xc2\x92re not cool with it...'
Rachel	 Oh-oh-oh, which one is Bonnie again?'
Phoebe	 You remember her from my birthday party two years ago. She\xc2\x92s yeah,\nlike, average height, medium build, bald...'
Rachel	 Oh! (laughs) That\xc2\x92s fine.'
Phoebe	 Great! Okay, good for you! (as they leave she slaps Rachel on the butt)'
Hoshi	 You are iron. You are steel! Let me ask you something, how come when I\ncall your computer support line, I have to wait an hour and a half?'
Pete	 I told you, we\xc2\x92re adding new operators all the time. Could we\nconcentrate on my training?'
Hoshi	 It\xc2\x92s just hard when I know I have e-mail I can\xc2\x92t get! '
Monica	 (entering) Hi!'
Pete	 Monica! (runs over and kisses her) Hi honey.'
Hoshi	 All right, on the table. (Pete gets on the table for his rubdown)'
Monica	 Hey, umm, so listen umm, my friends were telling me a little about this\nah, ultimate fighting thing and it, well it sounds really dangerous. I-I don\xc2\x92t want\nyou to get hurt, \xc2\x91cause I kinda like you.'
Pete	 Oh, believe me, I don\xc2\x92t want to get hurt either. I\xc2\x92m being smart\nabout this. See these guys? They\xc2\x92re the best trainers in the world, and Hoshi here\nused to be a paid assassin. (Hoshi yells at him in Chinese) A house painter! He used to be\na house painter.'
Monica	 Promise me you\xc2\x92ll be careful.'
Pete	 I promise.'
Monica	 Hey, are we still on for tonight?'
Pete	 Yeah.'
Monica	 Okay, good, \xc2\x91cause umm, well maybe we could have a little workout\nof our own...'
Hoshi	 No! No boom-boom before big fight!'
Monica	 How \xc2\x91bout just a boom?'
Rachel	 (to Phoebe) Well that was depressing, I think I just bought a soft\npretzel from one of the kids from Fame. Ready to go to the movies?'
Phoebe	 Um-hmm. Oh wait! This is Bonnie. (who has hair by the way)'
Bonnie	 Hi!'
Rachel	 This is Bonnie? (to Phoebe) This is Bonnie? (to Bonnie) You\xc2\x92re\nBonnie?'
Bonnie	 I can show you an ID if you want?'
Rachel	 Oh no, I\xc2\x92m sorry, you look a lot different from the last time I-I\nsaw you.'
Bonnie	 Oh yeah, well I just started wearing bras again.'
Rachel	 Oh, that must be it.'
Phoebe	 (to Bonnie) Well I hope you have fun tonight.'
Bonnie	 Thanks! You too.'
Rachel	 (to Phoebe) You said she was bald.'
Phoebe	 Yeah, she was bald, she\xc2\x92s not now.'
Rachel	 How could you not tell me that she has hair?'
Phoebe	 I don\xc2\x92t know, I hardly ever say that about people.'
Rachel	 (looks in the window) Ohh, well, this is just perfect!'
Phoebe	 Well I\xc2\x92m sorry, I thought you said it was okay.'
Rachel	 Yeah, I said what was okay when I thought she was some weird bald chick.\nI mean, y'know, that girl has hair got all over head!"
Phoebe	 Well, maybe it won\xc2\x92t work out. Maybe Ross won\xc2\x92t like her\npersonality.'
Rachel	 Why, does she have a bad personality?'
Phoebe	 Oh no, Bonnie\xc2\x92s the best!'
Doug	 Bing! (Chandler stands bolt upright and turns around to face him.) Read\nyour Computech proposal, a real homerun. (He goes to slap his butt, but Chandler slides\nover making him miss.) Ooh. Barely got ya that time, get over here. Come on. (Chandler\ngoes over) Wham! (slaps him on the butt) Good one. That was a good one. (to a couple of\nChandler\xc2\x92s co-workers) Keep at it team. (goes into his office)'
Chandler	 (to his co-workers) What is with him?'
Phil	 With him? You\xc2\x92re is favourite, you\xc2\x92re his guy!'
Stevens	 We never get smacked.'
Chandler	 Well, that\xc2\x92s not true, he-he smacked you once.'
Phil	 Not on purpose, he ricocheted of you and got me.'
Stevens	 I\xc2\x92m telling you, I need some smacks. I got a kid starting\nDartmouth in the fall.'
Doug	 (coming out of his office) Dartmouth? Who went to Dartmouth? Dartmouth\nsucks. Did you go to Dartmouth Bing?'
Chandler	 No sir.'
Doug	 There you go. (smacks him on the butt)'
Ross	 (walking up with this huge tub-o-popcorn and drink) Hey!'
Monica	 God Ross, what is that?'
Ross	 Yeah, it\xc2\x92s the Ultimate Fighting Combo. Yeah, I saved thirty cents,\nplus I get to keep the cup. Yay!!'
Announcer	 From New York City, New York! Appearing in his Ultimate Fighting\nChampionship debut! He\xc2\x92s known for his confrontational business style. Ladies and\nGentlemen, introducing Pete Beck-errrr!!'
Monica	 I love you, Pete!!!'
Announcer	 And his opponent, from Hunnington Beach, California! He\xc2\x92s a 300\npound street fighter, Tank Abbottttttt!!!! '
Monica	 (going up to the ring) Pete! Pete!! That guy\xc2\x92s pretty huge!'
Pete	 Don\xc2\x92t worry, Hoshi taught me how to use an opponent\xc2\x92s strength\nand weight against him.'
Ross	 Well, then that guy is in serious, serious trouble.'
Ross	 All right! You go get him! Let\xc2\x92s go!'
Referee	 Here we go gentlemen, here we go! (to Tank Abbott) Are you ready? (He\nnods, and takes out his teeth) (to Pete) Are you ready? (Pete nods, \xc2\x93Yes.\xc2\x94)\nLet\xc2\x92s get it on!!'
Pete	 Uh-oh.'

Monica	 Hey! (she sits down next to him) It\xc2\x92s me. Mon-i-ca! Can I just tell\nyou how proud I am of you.'
Pete	 It would be nice after hearing 20,000 people chant \xc2\x93You suck!\xc2\x94'
Monica	 I mean I-I thought you were nuts at first, but you-you did it. And now\nyou can just look back at this thing with no regrets.'
Pete	 What, look back?'
Monica	 Well, you\xc2\x92re not gonna get going are you?'
Pete	 Well let me ask you a question. Am I the Ultimate Fighting Champion?'
Monica	 Well, no. But...'
Pete	 Well I\xc2\x92m not gonna stop until I\xc2\x92m the Ultimate Fighting\nChampion.'
Monica	 That guy stood on your neck until you passed out!'
Pete	 Let me tell you a story. When I set out to create Moss 865, do you think\nit just happened overnight? No. There was Moss 1, that burnt down my Dad\xc2\x92s garage,\nthere was Moss 2 that would only schedule appointments in January, and 862 others that I\nlearned from, just like I learned from this fight, never to let a guy stand on my neck.'
Monica	 You didn\xc2\x92t know that already?'
Pete	 Look, I\xc2\x92m gonna get better. Okay? I promise you.'
Monica	 Okay, just get a lot better. (pause) Fast.'
Pete	 Oh, one other thing. Hoshi thinks that you being ringside may have\naffected my concentration.'
Monica	 Yeah. That-that was the problem.'
Monica	 (joining them) Hey.'
Ross	 Hey! How long until Pete\xc2\x92s fight?'
Monica	 Oh, about five minutes. Right now they\xc2\x92re interviewing his\nopponent. Apparently he trains by going to Iran and pulling the arms off thieves.'
Ross	 Hot dog?'
Monica	 Four, please. (Ross looks at her) I\xc2\x92m really nervous. (Ross gives\nher the four dogs) Thank you. (she grabs four buns, and heads back inside)'
Phoebe	 So Ross, how umm, how did it go with Bonnie?'
Ross	 What? Oh! I gotta tell you, I-I wasn\xc2\x92t expecting to like her at all,\nI mean I actually wasn\xc2\x92t expecting to like anyone right now, but she\xc2\x92s really\nterrific.'
Phoebe	 Ohh, that\xc2\x92s too bad!'
Ross	 No, I-I\xc2\x92m saying I liked her.'
Phoebe	 Yeah, y'know what, there are other fish in the sea."
Ross	 Pheebs, I think she\xc2\x92s great. Okay? We\xc2\x92re going out again.'
Phoebe	 Okay, I hear you! Are you capable of talking about any thing else?'
Chandler	 (joining them) Hey! Which one\xc2\x92s my turkey burger?'
Ross	 Ahh, the one next to my foot. Sorry.'
Joey	 (sticking his head out the window) Hey, the fight\xc2\x92s starting!'
Ross	 Okay, we\xc2\x92ll be right in. (to Chandler) So ah, did your boss try to\nslap you again today?'
Chandler	 Nine times! Okay, I had to put on lotion! But, it\xc2\x92s gonna be\nokay, because as of tomorrow I\xc2\x92m conducting an experiment, and if all goes as\nplanned, my butt will be smack free.'
Joey	 (sticking his head out the window) Fight\xc2\x92s over!'
Chandler	 Excuse me, Doug? (no reaction) Hey there sports fan!!'
Doug	 (turning around) Bing! You got those numbers for me?'
Chandler	 No, I ah, I didn\xc2\x92t do them.'
Doug	 Oh, you forgot?'
Chandler	 No, no I just ah, didn\xc2\x92t do them. Instead, I ah, hung out with a\ncouple of friends and had a couple of beers so I certainly don\xc2\x92t deserve any praise,\nverbal or otherwise.'
Doug	 Well, I got tanked myself last night. Pretty dicey drive home, Tapanzi\nBridge never looked smaller. (laughs) That\xc2\x92s okay, you\xc2\x92re still my number one\nguy! (slaps him on the butt) Bing!'
Chandler	 Doug!!'
Doug	 Hmm.'
Chandler	 I\xc2\x92m a little bit uncomfortable with the that way you express\nyourself.'
Doug	 Oh, is it the swearing? I mean is it the constant swearing? Because I\ngotta tell ya, if it is, you can just... kiss my ass!'
Chandler	 No, no. It-it\xc2\x92s not about the swearing, it\xc2\x92s more about ah,\nthe way, that you ah, occasionally, concentrate, your enthusiasm on my buttock.'
Doug	 Oh?'
Chandler	 Oh, and don\xc2\x92t get me wrong, I appreciate the sentiment. It\xc2\x92s\njust that I, I have a rather, sensitive posterior, and ah, besides, it\xc2\x92s making all\nthe other guys jealous.'
Doug	 Well, say no more. Y'know it takes guts to bring this up. Bing!\nYou\xc2\x92re okay."
Chandler	 Okay. (he starts to leave)'
Doug	 Ha! (goes to smack him on the butt, but stops, faking Chandler out)\nAhhhhhhh!'
Chandler	 Ahhhhh! (walks out, imitating shooting himself in the head)'
Phoebe	 Okay. Would you rather live in the shirt pocket of a sweaty giant, or\ninside his shower drain?'
Rachel	 (seeing Ross and Bonnie inside Central Perk) Oh my God! Phoebe look,\nit\xc2\x92s Ross and that girl.'
Phoebe	 No! No! Look at that! (drags her away from the window) It\xc2\x92s a line\nof ants! They\xc2\x92re working as a team!'
Rachel	 Phoebe! (goes back to the window)'
Phoebe	 (looking in the window) Right, oh yeah. Wow, oh, it looks like Ross is\nbreaking up with her. Uff, I hope he lets her down easy. Let\xc2\x92s go.'
Rachel	 Come on Phoebe, look at that! They are not breaking up, look at them.\nOkay that\xc2\x92s, you know what that is? That is a, that is a second date, that\xc2\x92s\nwhat that is! Look at that, she just put her hand on his thigh...'
Phoebe	 Oh no! That really is nothing, she is very sexually aggressive.'
Rachel	 Ohh! (walking away from the window) Phoebe, this is all your fault! Now\nhe loves her, he\xc2\x92s gonna marry her, and this is all your fault.'
Phoebe	 You said it was okay!'
Rachel	 You said she was bald!!'
Phoebe	 What?! What-what-what-what-what?!!'
Rachel	 Phoebe, we can\xc2\x92t, we just can\xc2\x92t just let it happen! Okay, we\nhave to do something! We have to break them up! Okay? Just go in there and like, shave her\nhead! You owe me one bald girl!!'
Phoebe	 Okay, first of all, breathe. Second of all, I don\xc2\x92t get it.\nAren\xc2\x92t you the one that decided that you didn\xc2\x92t want to be with Ross?'
Rachel	 (quietly) Yes.'
Phoebe	 Well isn\xc2\x92t he your friend? Don\xc2\x92t you want him to be happy?'
Rachel	 Yes.'
Phoebe	 So?'
Rachel	 I just y'know, I didn\xc2\x92t expect him to be this happy so soon. Ufff.\nOoo-ooh! (sits down on the curb) "
Phoebe	 (sits down next to her and hugs her) Oh no.'
Rachel	 What?'
Phoebe	 Oh, we killed them all.'
Rachel	 Oh! '
Pete	 It\xc2\x92s okay, it\xc2\x92s not as bad as it looks, it\xc2\x92s a precaution.\nAh, I\xc2\x92m not supposed to move my spine.'
Monica	 Please tell me you\xc2\x92re stopping now.'
Pete	 I\xc2\x92m fine! I\xc2\x92d fight tonight, if they\xc2\x92d let me. (stands up\nand starts swinging his arms) See this circle I\xc2\x92m marking off here? This is my zone\nof terror.'
Monica	 You are insane! You-you gotta give this up!'
Pete	 I can\xc2\x92t until I\xc2\x92m the ultimate fighter. I will do it. I\xc2\x92m\ntelling you, the day will come when children will argue over who will win a fight, me or\nSuperman. Now, I\xc2\x92m not saying I could beat Superman, but y'know, kids are stupid."
Monica	 Sit down. All right? Please, just listen to me. You are terrible at\nthis! Okay? You are the worst ultimate fighter ever! Ever!! '
Pete	 Y'know I have a torn rotator cuff, a hairline fracture in my right\nforearm, and a severely bruised Adam\xc2\x92s Apple, but that really hurt."
Monica	 Well then, y'know what? I care about you to much to watch you hurt\nyourself like this. So if you have to do this, then you\xc2\x92re gonna have to do it\nwithout me."
Pete	 Well if you\xc2\x92re asking me to quit, then you\xc2\x92re asking me to be\nsomeone I\xc2\x92m not. I\xc2\x92ve got to do this.'
Monica	 Then I\xc2\x92ve gotta go. Bye. (kisses him and starts to walk out)'
Pete	 Mon-Monica?'
Monica	 Yes?'
Pete	 Could you leave a note? \xc2\x91Cause I\xc2\x92m on a lot of pain killers now,\nand I don\xc2\x92t know if I\xc2\x92ll remember this tomorrow. (She leaves.)'
Doug	 So, in conclusion, the lines all go up (points to the chart), so I\xc2\x92m\nhappy. Great job team! Tomorrow at 8
Chandler	 Thank you, sir.'
Stevens	 (coming back in) Oh, excuse me. I forgot my briefcase y'know, by\naccident."
Doug	 Of course, you did. Forgot something else too ya bastard! (smacks him on\nthe butt) (to Chandler) Well, what about you? You\xc2\x92re not feeling left out or anything\nare ya?'
Chandler	 No. No, not at all, that\xc2\x92s-that\xc2\x92s ridiculous.'
Doug	 Everybody else got one, and you want one too. Don\xc2\x92t you?'
Chandler	 Ye-ye-yeah, yes I do!'
Doug	 Now get on out of here, you! (smacks him on the butt)'

TV Announcer	 Pete Becker is circling the ring now. It looks like, he\xc2\x92s\njust trying to feel him out. Oh, Bruiser is just...'
Chandler	 Run! Run you crazy, rich freak!'
Rachel	 Oh, I can\xc2\x92t watch this. (turns her eyes away)'
Joey	 Check it out, he\xc2\x92s winning! (to Monica) Pete\xc2\x92s winning!'
Monica	 Really?!'
Joey	 No-o-o!!'
TV Announcer	 Uh-oh, Bruiser has Becker on the canvas and is going for his\nfavourite area.'
All	 Oh! Oh! (they all recoil in horror)'
Phoebe	 Wait, if that\xc2\x92s his favourite area, why is he being so mean to it?'
Ross	 Well, this is ironic. Of your last two boyfriends, Richard didn\xc2\x92t\nwant to have kids, and from the looks of it, now Pete can\xc2\x92t.'
All	 Ohh!! (they all start pointing at the screen)'
