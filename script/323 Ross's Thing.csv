Joey	 Hey, wouldn't be cool if our duck and chick had a little baby? We could\ncall it Chuck."
Chandler	 Or... Dick.'
Ross	 (entering) Hey.'
Chandler and Joey	 Hey.'
Ross	 Listen, I-I need a favor. Umm, I was in the shower, and as I was cleansing\nmyself, I ah, I-I, well I felt something.'
Chandler	 Was it like a sneeze only better?'
Ross	 No, no, I mean, I mean a thing on my body.'
Joey	 (with a disgusted look) What was it?'
Ross	 Well, I don't know, it's-it's kinda in a place that's not... It's not\nvisually accessible to me, and I was hoping maybe you guys could-could help me out.\n(starts to take off his pants)"
Chandler and Joey	 Whoa!!!'
Chandler	 No!!'
Ross	 Come on you guys, it's no big deal! (He turns around and shows him his\nthing.)"
Chandler	 Whoa-heeeiiiiii-iiiii-ah!! (sees it) Huh.'
Ross	 Well what is it? Is it a mole? (He moves closer to them, and they jump\nback.)'
Joey	 No, it's too wrinkly to be a mole."
Ross	 Well, eww. What? Is it a pimple?'
Chandler	 No, it's... fancier than a pimple. Look Ross, why don't you just go\nsee a\xc2\x85 "
Rachel	 (entering, interrupting them) Hey guys! What's... (sees what they're\ndoing and stops, the guys are stunned)"
Chandler	 Okay, well, it's definite, two more weeks of winter."
Ross	 Ahhh.'
Joey	 Yeah, right.'

Phoebe	 (to her date) Okay, and then this is the coffee house. This is where I\nplay my music. (points to the stage)'
Vince	 Good deal.'
Phoebe	 Yeah, and these are my friends. People. This is Vince, Vince the people.'
Rachel	 Hi!'
Chandler	 Hey!'
Vince	 Hey!'
Phoebe	 Vince is a fireman.'
Rachel	 Wow! Have you ever rescued anyone from a burning building before?'
Vince	 98 hot saves, highest in the force.'
Chandler	 Well, y'know if Joey and I played with matches we could get you up to\nan even hundred. "
Vince	 (dead serious) Fire safety is not a joke, son.'
Chandler	 You're right, I know."
Vince	 (to Phoebe) Look, I gotta go. I'm on call tonight. (kisses her) See you\nSaturday. (leaves)"
Phoebe	 Okay. (watches him leave)'
Rachel	 Wow, he's cute, Pheebs! But I thought you just started dating that\nKindergarten teacher."
Phoebe	 Oh, Jason? Yeah, uh-huh, we're seeing each other tonight."
Rachel	 What-Pheebs?! Two dates in one day? That's so unlike you."
Phoebe	 I know, I know! I'm like playing the field. Y'know? Like, juggling two\nguys, I'm sowing my wild oats. Y'know? Y'know, this kind've like y'know oat-sowin',\nfield-playin' juggler."
Joey	 So Pheebs, do they know about each other?'
Phoebe	 Does a dog's lips move when he reads? (Joey makes an `I don't know'\nface, and looks to Chandler and Rachel, who're also stumped) Okay, no they don't."
Ross	 (entering) Hey guys!'
Joey	 Hey.'
Rachel	 Hi!'
Joey	 (going over to him) Well?!'
Chandler	 (joining them) Okay, how'd it go at the doctor's?"
Ross	 Well, he said there's definitely nothing to worry about, it's totally\nbenign."
Joey	 Well what is it?!'
Ross	 He couldn't even tell me! He said it was just some sort of skin...\nabnormality. And the worst thing is he-he-he said, he said, without being able to identify\nit, he was reluctant to remove it."
Chandler	 Y'know what? You should go to my guy, because when I went in there\nwith my third nipple. He just lopped it right off. Y'know? So I guess I'm lucky. I mean\nnot as lucky as people who were born with two nipples."
Ross	 At least they knew what yours was. Y'know, yours had a name."
Joey	 Oh! Maybe they\'ll name yours after you! Y\'know, they\'ll call it, The Ross.\nAnd then people would be like, "Awww, he\'s got a Ross."'
Ross	 (sarcastic) Yeah, that'd be cool!"
Monica	 Pete's breaking up with me."
All	 What?!'
Monica	 I just checked my messages, and he said that when he gets back from\nAtlanta, we need to talk.'
Rachel	 And?'
Monica	 Well that's it. People never say `We need to talk' unless it's something\nbad."
Joey	 Whoa, that doesn't necessarily mean that he's breaking up with you."
Monica	 Really?!'
Joey	 Yeah, maybe he just cheated on you.'
Jason	 ...and I know I'll never miss doing it, but I gotta tell you, it's pretty\ncool knowing that you're making a difference in a kid's life."
Phoebe	 That is so great! Oh, I... (sees that a parked car near them has caught\non fire) Oh my God!'
Jason	 Whoa!'
Phoebe	 (the fire has worsened) Oh my God!!!'
Jason	 Ahh-ahh, we'd better call the fire department!"
Phoebe	 (stopping him) No! No! '
Jason	 No, no?'
Phoebe	 Well, we don't n-n-n-n-need a fireman, we'd, we'd like a good mechanic.\n(hears the sound of approaching sirens) Oh my God, here they come! Well, we gotta get out\nof here!"
Jason	 W-w-w-wait! Why?!'
Phoebe	 Well look, if I wanted to see a fireman, I would date one. Okay? (she\ndrags him away)'
Ross	 Th-th-that's all it is, a third nipple. Y'know? Just your run-of-the-mill\nthird nipple. Y'know? You can take it off. Just slice that baby right off!"
Dr. Rhodes	 Take your shirt off, and let's see what we're dealing with here.\n(Ross starts to take off his pants) What are you doing?"
Ross	 Just showing you my run-of-the-mill-slice-it-right-off third nipple.'
Dr. Rhodes	 Well that's not a third nipple."
Ross	 No?'
Dr. Rhodes	 First of all, it's on your ass."
Ross	 Well then, what is it?!'
Dr. Rhodes	 Wait a minute, hold it. (He goes to the door and opens it.) Johnson!\nWill you come in here a moment?'
Dr. Johnson	 I'm with Hamilton!"
Dr. Rhodes	 He's good with rear things, bring him in too."
Monica	 (starting to get up) I gotta go water Pete's plants. (stops) Y'know\nwhat, if he's gonna break up with me, maybe I won't water his plants."
Chandler	 Well, if he's gonna break up with you, maybe Joey and I should water\nhis plants. If y'know what I mean."
Joey	 Or ha-ha, we could go over there and pee on them.'
Phoebe	 (entering with Rachel) \xc2\x85and I-I can't take it! Y'know? I'm just,\nalways afraid one of them is gonna catch me with the other one. It's making me crazy."
Rachel	 Well honey, then why don't you break up with one of them?"
Phoebe	 (disgusted) Uh.'
Joey	 Whoa-whoa-whoa. What ah, what happened to playing the field?'
Phoebe	 Well, it just, it doesn't feel like playing anymore, it feels like work.\nIt's like I'm working in the field."
Rachel	 So Pheebs, pick one of them.'
Monica	 Yeah. Which one do you like more?'
Phoebe	 Well, Vince is great, y'know `cause, he's like a guy, guy. Y'know? He's\nso burly, he's sooo very burly. (giggles)"
Joey	 Okay, good, so there you go. Go with Vince.'
Phoebe	 Yeah, but Jason's really sensitive."
Chandler	 Well sensitive is important, pick him.'
Phoebe	 Yeah.'
Joey	 Oh sure, go with the sissy.'
Phoebe	 Jason is not a sissy!'
Joey	 Oh no-no-no-no, I meant Chandler.'
Ross	 Y'know I have dinner plans!!"
Dr. Rhodes	 Thank you soo much for coming on such a short notice. Ladies and\ngentlemen, I've-I've-I've been practicing medicine for twenty-three years, and I'm\nstumped. "
All	 Whoa. (they all lean in to get a closer look, Ross isn't pleased)"
Monica	 Okay, this is the den. All right, check this out. Lights! (the lights\nturn on automatically, but are very bright) Whoa! All right. Less lights! Bad lights!\nLights go away! (they dim) Oh, see you just need to find the right command.'
Ross	 Yes, and the dimmer switch.'
Joey	 Whoa! For a rich guy he's got, that's a pretty small TV."
Monica	 No-no-no, that's a video-phone. But hey guys you're not supposed to be\nhere, so please, do not touch anything."
Chandler	 (sitting down on the couch) I-kea! This is comfortable.'
Rachel	 (entering with Phoebe) This place is amazing.'
Phoebe	 God, that is the nicest kitchen.'
Monica	 I know.'
Phoebe	 No! But it's the nicest kitchen, the refrigerator told me to have a\ngreat day."
Joey	 Look at this! A millionaire's checkbook."
Monica	 Joey, put that down! (the phone rings) Oh my God! It's Pete. Okay, get\nout!! How the hell do you answer a video-phone! (steps in front of it, and automatically\nanswers it)"
Pete	 Monica? (the gang ducks and hides)'
Monica	 I guess that's how."
Pete	 Hey Monica, how's it going."
Monica	 Oh it\xc2\x92s umm, good! It's umm, it\xc2\x92s good, just here watering the\nplants."
Pete	 Well don't forget that fiches over there by Rachel."
Rachel	 (standing up) Ahh... Chandler's on the couch!!"
Pete	 I see him, you guys are just the worst hiders ever.'
All	 (standing up) Hey Pete.'
Joey	 Hi, how ya doing?'
Monica	 Ahh, Pete, the other day when you said you needed to talk, umm, just so\nI know, is it good news or bad news.'
Pete	 Oh, it's good news. No, it's definitely good news. Hold on a second, I\nhave another call. (clicks his remote) (to his other call) Hey, how's it going?"
Monica	 Oh no-no-no, it's still me."
Pete	 Ah, no it's not. I've got picture-in-picture here. (to other caller) Yeah.\n(listens) Yeah, okay. I'm gonna have to call you back later. (pause) Monica? You. I'm\ngonna have to call you back."
Monica	 Oh, oh, okay umm, so I'll see you soon."
Pete	 Okay, I love you.'
Monica	 I love you.'
All	 I love you, love you.'
Monica	 Okay. Well, it's good news. It's good news."
Chandler	 So, what do you thing the good news is?'
Joey	 (looking at the checkbook) Wow! Look at this! He wrote a check for 50,000\ndollars to Hugo Ligrens Ring Design. (Monica is stunned) Oh, sorry, what do you think the\ngood news is?'
Monica	 Oh my.'
Rachel	 Monica's gonna marry a millionaire!!!"
Ross	 Hey, you gotta get Mom on the phone. Call Mom! Call Mom!'
Pete's Mom	 Hello."
Monica	 And that's Pete's Mom. "

Rachel	 Mon you definitely have to make it a theme wedding, and the theme could\nbe, \xc2\x93Look how much money we\xc2\x92ve got!\xc2\x94 Y'know, I mean you could put, you\ncould put money in-in the invitations! You-you could have like little money place\nsettings. And ah, you could start with a money salad! I mean it\xc2\x92ll be dry, but people\nwill like it."
Monica	 Would you stop? We\xc2\x92ve only been going out a couple of weeks, I mean\nwe don\xc2\x92t even know if he\xc2\x92s gonna propose.'
Chandler	 Yes, but this is Pete. Okay? He\xc2\x92s not like other people, on your\nfirst date he took you to Rome. For most guys that\xc2\x92s like a third or fourth date\nkinda thing.'
Monica	 Well if-if that\xc2\x92s what it is, then it\xc2\x92s-it\xc2\x92s crazy.'
Ross	 Monica\xc2\x92s right. We\xc2\x92re talking about getting married here. Okay?\nShe-she can\xc2\x92t just rush into this.'
Rachel	 Oh please, what do you know! You married a lesbian!'
Phoebe	 All right. I gotta go. I have break up with Vince.'
Chandler	 Oh, so you\xc2\x92re going with the teacher, huh?'
Phoebe	 Yeah, I like Vince a lot, y'know? But, it\xc2\x92s just Jason\xc2\x92s so\nsensitive, y'know? And in the long run, I think sensitive it\xc2\x92s just better than\nhaving just like a really, really, really nice (pause) butt. (Her eyes glaze over thinking\nabout the butt.) (pause) Jason! Definitely Jason! Okay, wish me luck!"
All	 Good luck!'
Rachel	 OH MY GOD!!! (She holds her hands up in triumph and the gang all look at\nher.) Sorry, I was just imagining what it\xc2\x92d be like to catch the money bouquet. '
Phoebe	 Excuse me. Umm, is Vince here?'
Fireman	 Oh sure. Vince?!'
Vince	 Yo!! (slides down that pole that fire station\xc2\x92s have)'
Phoebe	 Wow! I didn\xc2\x92t know you guys actually used those. '
Vince	 So, what\xc2\x92s up?'
Phoebe	 Umm, wow. This-this isn\xc2\x92t gonna be easy. Umm, I don\xc2\x92t think we\nshould see each other anymore.'
Vince	 Uh-huh. G-good deal.'
Phoebe	 I\xc2\x92m sorry.'
Vince	 No-no it\xc2\x92s okay. It\xc2\x92s just that ah, I thought we had something\npretty special here. And y'know I-I felt like you were someone I could finally open up to,\nand\xc2\x85 (starts choking up) That there\xc2\x92s so much in me I have to share with you\nyet."
Phoebe	 Oh my God, I didn\xc2\x92t\xc2\x85'
Vince	 (starting to cry) I\xc2\x92m sorry, I can\xc2\x92t talk. I\xc2\x92m gonna go\nwrite in my journal. (walks away)'
Phoebe	 (running after him) Wait-wait-wait! Wait!!'
Phoebe	 (to Ross) I\xc2\x92m telling you, if you want to take care of that thing,\nyou should go to my herbal guy.'
Ross	 Thank you, but I want to remove it Pheebs. I don\xc2\x92t want to make it\nsavory.'
Monica	 Y'know when girls sleep with guys with weird things on their body, they\ntell their friends about it."
Ross	 Gimme this. (Grabs the herbalist\xc2\x92s card and leaves.)'
Rachel	 (entering) Hi! Okay, don\xc2\x92t be mad at me, but I couldn\xc2\x92t\nresist.'
Monica	 Brides magazines?'
Rachel	 Yes, and I know that you\xc2\x92d say no if he asked you, but I\xc2\x92m\nsorry; how great would you look walking down the aisle in this Donna Carin. (shows her the\npicture.)'
Phoebe	 (gasps) Oh, you so would! Oh, you should get that anyway. (They both\nlook at her.) Like for clubbing. '
Monica	 It is so weird, I know what I said, but uh, this morning, I was lying in\nbed I was, I was imagining what it would be like to say yes. (Rachel slams the magazine\nshut in amazement.) I know it\xc2\x92s a little sudden, and it\xc2\x92s a little rushed, and\nit\xc2\x92s totally not like me to do something like this, but that doesn\xc2\x92t mean I\ncan\xc2\x92t. Right? I mean I\xc2\x92m-I\xc2\x92m crazy about Pete, and I know that we want the\nsame things, and when I thought about saying yes, it made me really happy.'
Rachel	 Oh my God. (starting to cry) '
Monica	 I know. (pause) I need more pie. (goes and gets some)'
Phoebe	 Hey Mon umm, if you do get married, can I bring two guests?'
Rachel	 You didn\xc2\x92t break up with that fireman?'
Phoebe	 No, that was my way of telling you. Well, it turns out he\xc2\x92s\nincredibly sensitive, he keeps a journal and he paints. He even showed me charcoal\ndrawings that he drew of me.'
Rachel	 Wow!'
Phoebe	 Yeah, well he\xc2\x92d prefer water colors, but y'know, he has easy access\nto a lot of charcoal."
Monica	 So then, are you going to dump Jason?'
Phoebe	 Well, yeah, because I have to break up with someone, and\xc2\x85 Okay so\nJason is sensitive, (holds up one finger) but now so\xc2\x92s Vince (holds up one finger on\nher other hand) Plus, Vince has the body y'know? (holds up two more fingers on the Vince\nside) So\xc2\x85 It\xc2\x92s really just about the math."
Phoebe	 (knocks on the door) Jason?'
Jason	 Yeah, come on in.'
Jason	 So Phoebe, you ah, sounded kinda serious on the phone, is ah, is anything\nwrong?'
Phoebe	 Nah-ha!'
Guru Saj	 You must be Ross.'
Ross	 Hi.'
Guru Saj	 I am Guru Saj. (takes the drawer back and replaces)'
Ross	 Listen, I got to tell you I\xc2\x92ve-I\xc2\x92ve never been to a guru before,\nso...'
Guru Saj	 Well, relax. If it makes you feel better, I\xc2\x92ve attended some of\nthe finest medical schools in Central America. Well then, let\xc2\x92s take a look at this\nskin abnormality of yours. (motions to the table) Come on, have a seat. (looks at it) Eeh,\nhuh. As I suspected, it\xc2\x92s a koondis!'
Ross	 What\xc2\x92s a koondis?'
Guru Saj	 I don\xc2\x92t know, what\xc2\x92s a koondis with you? (starts laughing as\nif that joke was funny, Ross only looks at him, and he stops) Please, lie down! I\xc2\x92ve\ngot a sav that oughta shrink that right up.'
Ross	 I guess it\xc2\x92s worth a try.'
Guru Saj	 Oh sure, we should see results\xc2\x97Whoa!! Clearly not the way to go!!\n(quickly wipes it off)'
Ross	 What?! What?!'
Guru Saj	 We appear to have angered it.'
Ross	 We?! We angered it?!'
Guru Saj	 Oh, I think I see the problem. And I\xc2\x92m afraid we\xc2\x92re gonna\nhave to use a much stronger tool. (Ross gives him a \xc2\x91What?\xc2\x92 look) Love.'
Ross	 Oh God!'
Guru Saj	 (He starts moving his hands around in circles above the thing.) Ross,\nthere is absolutely no way this is going to come off unless you start to\xc2\x85'
Ross	 Ow!! '
Guru Saj	 Oops.'

Guru Saj	 It got caught on my watch.'
Ross	 Hey! (congratulates him)'
Pete	 Lights. (The lights turn on, once again they\xc2\x92re too bright.) Uh,\nromantic lights. (The lights dim.)'
Monica	 Ooh, nice.'
Pete	 So ah, there was this thing I wanted to talk to you about.'
Monica	 Oh, right! I completely forgot about that.'
Pete	 Well ah, I\xc2\x92ve been doing a lot of thinking, and I look at my\nlife\xc2\x85'
Monica	 Yeah?'
Pete	 And I feel like I\xc2\x92ve conquered the business world, and I feel like\nI\xc2\x92ve conquered the intellectual world, and now I-I have the most beautiful woman in\nthe world.'
Monica	 Wow.'
Pete	 There\xc2\x92s one thing missing.'
Monica	 What\xc2\x92s that?'
Pete	 It\xc2\x92s time for me to conquer the physical world.'
Monica	 Okay. (not sure of herself)'
Pete	 Monica, I want to become (pause) the Ultimate Fighting Champion.'
Monica	 You wanna what?!'
Pete	 I want to become the Ultimate Fighting Champion! It\xc2\x92s the most\nintense physical competition in the world, it\xc2\x92s banned in 49 states!'
Monica	 What are you talking about?'
Pete	 Okay, my trainer, Ho Chi, is teaching me a combination of Gee Koon Doe and\nBrazilian street fighting, I\xc2\x92ve even had my own octagon training ring designed.'
Monica	 And I suppose you used a ring designer for that.'
Pete	 Yeah. Monica, I want you there in the front row when I win. I want you\nclose enough to smell the blood. What do you think?'
Monica	 My parents will be so happy.'
Phoebe	 (singing) \xc2\x93Crazy underwear, creepin\xc2\x92 up my butt. (Jason\nenters) Crazy underwear, always in a rut. Crazy under-(sees Jason)-wear\xc2\x85\xc2\x94 (In\nher head) Oh No! What is he doing here? All right, just keep playing, just keep\nplaying. You\xc2\x92ll get through this; you\xc2\x92ll be fine. (She tries to continue the\nsong, but she has lost the ability to pronounce words, and the lyrics come out as\ngibberish.) (giving up on the song) Okay, thank you. And, as always no one talk to me\nafter the show.'
Jason	 (going up to her) Hey. I was\xc2\x85'
Phoebe	 Hey!'
Jason	 I was passin\xc2\x92 by and I saw that you were playing tonight, it\xc2\x92s\nkinda cool seeing you up there. (kisses her)'
Vince	 (running over) Whoa! Hey-hey! What\xc2\x92s going on here? Who is this guy?'
Phoebe	 I don\xc2\x92t know, he just started kissing me. Get him! Get him, Vince!'
Vince	 What?!'
Jason	 What?!'
Phoebe	 Yeah, okay, I\xc2\x92ve-I\xc2\x92ve been dating both of you, and it\xc2\x92s\nbeen really horrible. \xc2\x91Cause y'know it\xc2\x92s been a lot of fun, for me. Umm, but I-I\nlike you both, and I, and I didn\xc2\x92t know how to chose, so... I\xc2\x92m sorry, I\xc2\x92m\njust, I\xc2\x92m terrible, I\xc2\x92m a terrible person. I\xc2\x92m terrible."
Vince	 Phoebe, Phoebe relax, it\xc2\x92s okay. I mean we never said this was\nexclusive.'
Jason	 Yeah, and neither did we. Give yourself a break.'
Phoebe	 Really?!'
Jason	 Yeah. I mean y'know, we haven\xc2\x92t been going out that long.\nCome on, we haven\xc2\x92t even slept together yet. Huh."
Vince	 You haven\xc2\x92t?'
Jason	 You have?'
Phoebe	 Well, this is none of my business. (starts to walk away)'
Jason	 (to Phoebe) I-I can\xc2\x92t believe this! You-you\xc2\x92ve slept with him?!'
Phoebe	 Well, I made you a candle light dinner in the park.'
Jason	 Y'know Phoebe, I\xc2\x92m gonna make this real easy for you. (walks out)"
Phoebe	 (to Vince) Well, that could\xc2\x92ve been really awkward.'
Vince	 You made him a candle light dinner in the park?'
Phoebe	 Yeah, but I-I-I-I can do that for you, I\xc2\x92m gonna do that for you.'
Vince	 Uh yeah, I can\xc2\x92t believe I ever went out with somebody who would\nactually have an open flame in the middle of a wooden area. (walks out)'

Chandler	 (comforting the duck) Everything\xc2\x92s gonna be all right. Okay,\nDick?'
Guru Saj	 (entering) Hello, I am Guru Saj-(sees the duck)-Whoa!! (to Joey)\nThat\xc2\x92s supposed to be a duck right? \xc2\x91Cause otherwise, this is waaay out of my\nleague.'
Joey	 Yeah, yeah. He\xc2\x92s got a, he\xc2\x92s got a really bad cough, and our\nvet, he can\xc2\x92t do anything about it. Is there something you can do?'
Guru Saj	 Hmm, let me see. Let me see. Do you think you could get him to eat a\nbat?'
