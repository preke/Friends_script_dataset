Joey	 really, great, did I actually ask you?'
 Hayley	 no that's just where you were going I just figured that I'd help\n  you out, you don't seem like the kind of guy that does this very a lot."
 Gunther	 HA!'
Joey	 (turns round again) seriously Gunther you should see\n  someone about that cold, if it gets much worse you could DIE! (Gunther looks\n  scared)'
Ross	 so how'd the date go?"

Ross	 So he hasn't called?"
Phoebe	 would you call this girl? (Puts on a crying act)\n  thanks-fo-r-a-love-ly-even-ing'
Ross	 now I feel terrible this is all my fault.'
Phoebe	 well you not what you should feel terrible about,\n  this could have been my serious guy he was sweet and smart and funny. Do you\n  know how hard it is to meet a guy like that?'
Ross	 We are a rare breed.'
 Hayley	 what a great dinner.'
Joey	 yeah and hey thanks again for letting me having that\n  last piece of cake at the restaurant.'
 Hayley	 (laughs) your welcome again, I'm gonna make some coffee can I get\n  you anything?"

Ross	 (laughs) No'
Mike	 oh it's just you have that look (shuts the front door)"
Ross	 Damn super cuts!'
Mike	 what's up is Phoebe ok?"
Ross	 oh no yeah, no Phoebe is great, but umm I'm an idiot\n  look right before you guys went out I accidentally got her all upset."
Mike	 that's why she was weird."
Ross	 yes, yeah I said something stupid about her never\n  having had a serious relationship, but you should know she is so much fun,\n  a wonderful person please don't blow her off."
Mike	 I'm not blowing her off, I actually just got off the\n  phone with her, were going out tomorrow night, I mean I hope that's ok with\n  you stranger from the coffee house."
Ross	 well then I didn't need to bother you or the four\n  other Mike Hanagens I bothered."
Mike	 hey wait wait wait wait wait! Is that true what you\n  said Phoebe's never had a serious relationship?"
Ross	 of course she has. if she'd never had a serious relationship\n  I'd go round broadcasting it like some unstoppable moron."
Mike	 but you did say it'
Ross	 yes, yes I did. and I will also say what I'm about\n  to say Vis-\xc3\xa0-vis the following Phoebe has never had a serious relationship\n  since her. super-serious relationship with. Vicrum."
Mike	 Vicrum?'
Ross	 WHAT THAT'S A REAL NAME!"
Chandler	 (enters singing) Oklahoma where the wind comes\n  sweeping down the plane, STOP IT! Why couldn't they have sent me to Texas?\n  7 o clock maybe I'll hit the gym (sits down) who am I kidding pay-per-view\n  porn."
Chandler	 DO NOT DISTURB DO NOT DISTURB! Monica
Monica	
Chandler	 everything's great, just watching some regular\n  television there, what a pleasant surprise. (She hugs him, and she knows what\n  he was doing so she looks at the TV and sees sharks swimming around thinking\n  Chandler was giving himself a treat to sharks.)"
Monica	
Chandler	 Ok honey. that was close.'
Rachel	 Hello'
Monica	
Rachel	 Oh that couldn't have been pretty. but you know\n  guys do that."
Monica

Monica	
Rachel	 man sharks. I always knew there was something weird\n  about that dude. But you promised to love him no matter what.'
Monica	
Rachel	 Ah! You know what honey guys are just different,\n  they like things that we can't understand, you know I once dated this guy who\n  wanted to pretend he was an archeologist and I was a naughty cave woman that\n  he unfroze from a block of ice."
Monica	
Rachel	 yeah I didn't disguise that very well did i."
Joey	 (enters) Hey'
Rachel	 (sits down) Hi'
Joey	 listen to this... I went out with this girl last night\n  and half way through our date I realized I already slept with her.'
Rachel	 so basically you've slept with all the woman in\n  New York and now you're just going around again."
Joey	 well that's not even the weird part. I don't think\n  she remembered sleeping with me."
Monica	
Joey	 yeah but she should remember sleeping with me I am\n  very memorable, you guys know.'
Rachel	 what, how do we know, we never slept with you.'
Joey	 and who's fault is that."
Monica	
Joey	 HEY! I never have an off night ok although sometimes\n  when I'm a little bloated I don't feel very sexy BUT EVEN THEN I'M BETTER THEN\n  MOST!"
Monica	
Rachel	 yeah your both so slutty you don't even remember\n  who you've slept with, you're made for each other."
Joey	 Interesting. all right I'll go out with her again\n  and try to get past it (reaches for the chips) OH SALT BLOATY!"
Monica	
Joey	 What?'
Monica	
Joey	 No. (Pause) wait a minute what was the little mermaid?'
Phoebe	 It's open."
Ross	 Hey!'
Phoebe	 HEY! Mike called were going out again! YAY! YAY!\n  (She dances around with happiness)'
Ross	 YAY! (He continues the happiness with her by dancing\n  around) quick thing, I went to talk to Mike.'
Phoebe	 What? Wha-wha-wha-did you do ROSS!'
Ross	 oh boy you got mad at that part. I went over there\n  to tell him how great you are but you know me BLAH, BLAH, BLAH, and I ended\n  up telling him that.'
Phoebe	 WHAT!'
Ross	 umm. that you had a six year long relationship with\n  a guy named Vicrum.'
Phoebe	 WHAT! WHY?'
Ross	 well he seemed to bum hard that you'd never been in\n  a serious relationship."
Phoebe	 (Walks towards Ross) If you hadn't just had a baby\n  with my best friend I swear to Lucifer a raber dog would be feasting on your\n  danglers RIGHT NOW!"
Ross	 well Phoebe, I think you'll feel better when you know\n  a little bit about Vicrum, His a Kite designer (He makes a wow face) and he\n  used to date Oprah. (He makes another wow face)"
Phoebe	 I'm not going along with some lie you made Ross,\n  No I'm just gonna be honest with him."
Ross	 Good yeah just be honest with him.'
Phoebe	 yeah I've nothing to be ashamed of ok so I haven't\n  been in a relationship that lasted longer then a month. Ok I haven't had a\n  real boyfriend you know if he can't handle that he can leave. which he will\n  and that's ok. so I'll just be alone forever you know alright I'll be. it'll\n  be fine. it'll be fine. I'll go walking tours with widows and lesbians. Oh\n  (takes a deep breath and sits down, knock on the door)"
Ross	 I'll get it"
Phoebe	 ok'
Mike	 (Ross opens the door) You know I'm trying to think\n  of the last time I opened a door and you weren't there, Phoebe are you ok?\n  (She has her hands over her mouth)"
Phoebe	 Uh huh yeah (stands up) there's just something umm,\n  there's something you should know (Pause) Vicrum just called."
 Hayley	 so it was kind of a shock after 25 years of marriage my parents,\n  a perfect couple getting divorced, I kinda took it the hardest cause I was\n  the youngest.'
Joey	 Uh huh, sure, yeah. How can you not remember me?'
 Hayley	 What?'
Joey	 How could you not remember that we slept together?'
 Hayley	 What! When?'
Joey	 I dunno!'
 Hayley	 I really, really think I would remember sleeping with you'
Joey	 come on, come on, search your brain all right. it\n  was (thinks) a certain amount of time ago, I was here you were here, we had\n  sex (starts pointing out the places) here, here, here NOT there. Anything?'
 Hayley	 no it's not ringing any bells."
Joey	 my god woman! How many people do you have to had been\n  with not to remember any of this?'
 Hayley's roommate	 Hey Hayley you've really gotta fix that doorknob. Joey!"
Joey	 Ooooooooooh, I slept with you! And you obviously remember\n  me Hey! I still got it. (Turns back to Hayley) so were good. (She just glares\n  at him) I'll let myself out."
Phoebe	 .and I said Vicrum you can't just call every time\n  you get lonely you know, you, you gave up that right when you slept with Rachel."
Mike	 But Rachel I thought she just had a baby with Ross'
Phoebe	 yeah well (pause) yeah you know Emma's birth certificate\n  might say Geller but her eyes say Mookurgee."
Mike	 that is so wrong and on top of that his a glue sniffer.'
Phoebe	 I know but he call's and my heart goes to him. You\n  know that bastard is one smooth talking free lance kite designer."
Mike	 I just think there's somebody better out there for\n  you, (pause) I mean I'm not saying me but. maybe me."
Phoebe	 Oh.'
Mike	 and you don't have to worry about glue sniffing with\n  me. although I do smell the occasional magic marker, yeah ah anyway I just\n  think I can make you happy."
Phoebe	 ok I can't do this."
Mike	 what's wrong?"
Phoebe	 well there is no Vicrum, Ross made him up because\n  I never really have been in a long-term relationship, I've never lived with\n  a guy, and I've never even celebrated an anniversary so. (Pause) if that's\n  too weird for you and you wanna leave I totally understand. In fact I'll close\n  my eye's make it less awkward (She sits with her eyes closed and Mike kisses\n  her, Phoebe opens her eyes and like a little child says.) You kissed me."
Mike	 uh huh'
Phoebe	 so you don't think I'm a total freak"
Mike	 No. well look can I think your weird and also cool\n  for telling me the truth and also wanna kiss you.'
Phoebe	 I guess so, can I. can I think it's cool that you\n  kiss me and also wanna kiss you again (they get closer to kiss and Phoebe pulls\n  back) and umm, be a little concerned about the magic markers."
Mike	 Definitely'
Ross	 (They kiss and the phone rings and machine picks it\n  up, its Ross putting on an accent pretending to be Vicrum) This is Vicrum.'
Chandler	 Hi honey I'm home!"
Monica	
Chandler	 oh it was great.'
Monica	
Chandler	 well, well, well it must be five in Tulsa because\n  it's six o clock IN NY.C!"
Monica	
Chandler	 (Chandler looking confused) Honey why am I watching\n  a bunch of sharks swimming around.'
Monica	
Chandler	 no I'm not quite sure you got the right movie\n  that's all."
Monica	
Chandler	 does what always have to be sharks.'
Monica	
Chandler	 What's going on?"
Monica	
Chandler	 let ME be a part of this!'
Monica	
Chandler	 no they don't"
Monica	
Chandler	 OH MY GOD! When you came in I switched the channel,\n  I was just watching regular porn'
Monica	
Chandler	 yeah just some good old fashion girl on girl American\n  action.'
Monica	
Chandler	 You are an amazing wife. (Monica shrugs) No really\n  you're amazing you were actually gonna do this for me, I mean where do you\n  find the strength and understanding over something like that."
Monica	
Joey	 (looks at a girl walk in) see ordinarily I would talk\n  to her, but my confidence is shaken did I sleep with her? Did I not sleep with\n  her?'
 Phoebe	 you know maybe this is a wake up call, about your\n    whole dating attitude. Your in your thirty's and you've never had a serious\n    relationship and you have never been in a long term relationship, here you\n    go from woman to woman, meaningless experience to meaningless experience\n    never even worrying that it doesn't tern into anything serious."
Joey	 your right! I love my life! (He gets up to go and\n  speak to the girl and he turns back and sits down) I actually did sleep with\n  her.'
