Rachel	 That is it! You just barge in here, you don't knock"
Chandler	 I'm sorry!"
Rachel	 You have no respect for anybody's privacy!"
Chandler	 Rachel, wait, wait.'
Rachel	 No, you wait! This is ridiculous!'
Chandler	 Can I just say one thing?'
Rachel	 What? What?!'
Chandler	 That's a relatively open weave and I can still see your... nipular\nareas."
Rachel	 Oh!!'

Phoebe	 Oh, honey, honey, tell them the story about your patient who thinks\nthings are, like, other things. Y'know? Like, the phone rings and she takes a shower."
Roger	 That's pretty much it."
Phoebe	 Oops!'
Roger	 But you tell it really well, sweetie.'
Phoebe	 Thanks. Okay, now go away so we can talk about you.'
Roger	 Okay. I'll miss you."
Phoebe	 Isn't he great?"
Rachel	 He's so cute! And he seems to like you so much."
Phoebe	 I know, I know. So sweet... and so complicated. And for a shrink, he's\nnot too shrinky, y'know?"
Monica	 So, you think you'll do it on his couch?"
Phoebe	 Oh, I don't know, I don't know. I think that's a little weird, y'know?\nVinyl."
Rachel	 Okaaay. (To the guys, on the couch) Any of you guys want anything else?'
Chandler	 Oh, yes, could I have one of those. (Points)'
Rachel	 No, I'm sorry, we're all out of those. Anybody else?"
Chandler	 Okay.'
Roger	 Did I, uh, did I miss something?'
Chandler	 No, she's still upset because I saw her boobies."
Ross	 You what? Wh what were you doing seeing her boobies?'
Chandler	 It was an accident. Not like I was across the street with a telescope\nand a box of donuts.'
Rachel	 Okay, okay, could we change the subject, please?'
Phoebe	 Yeah, 'cause hello, these are not her boobies, these are her breasts."
Rachel	 Okay, Pheebs, I was hoping for more of a change.'
Chandler	 Y'know, I don't know why you're so embarrassed, they were very nice\nboobies."
Rachel	 Nice? They were nice. I mean, that's it? I mean, mittens are nice."
Chandler	 Okaaay, (Gestures) rock, hard place, me.'
Roger	 You're so funny! He's really funny! I wouldn't wanna be there when when\nthe laughter stops."
Chandler	 Whoah whoah, back up there, Sparky. What'd you mean by that?"
Roger	 Oh, just seems as though that maybe you have intimacy issues. Y'know,\nthat you use your humour as a way of keeping people at a distance."
Chandler	 Huh.'
Roger	 I mean hey! I just met you, I don't know you from Adam. ...Only child,\nright? Parents divorced before you hit puberty."
Chandler	 Uhhuh, how did you know that?'
Roger	 It's textbook."
Joey	 Hey you guys. Hey, you all know my dad, right?'
All	 Hey! Hey, Mr. Trib!'
Monica	 Hey, how long are you in the city?'
Mr. Tribbiani	 Just for a coupla days. I got a job midtown. I figure I'm better\noff staying with the kid than hauling my ass back and forth on the ferry. (Sees Roger) I\ndon't know this one."
Phoebe	 Oh, this is my friend Roger.'
Roger	 Hi. '
Mr. Tribbiani	 Hey, hey. Good to meet you, Roger.'
Roger	 You too, sir.'
Mr. Tribbiani	 (To Phoebe) What happened to the, uh, puppet guy?'
Joey	 Dad, dad. (Shakes his head)'
Mr. Tribbiani	 Oh, 'scuse me. So Ross, uh, how's the wife? (Ross whines and lays\nhis head on Chandler's shoulder) Off there too, uh? Uh, Chandler, quick, say something\nfunny!"
Mr. Tribbiani	 Gotta go. I miss you too, I love you, but it's getting real late\nnow"
Joey	 (Snatches the phone) Hey Ma. Listen, I made the appointment with Dr.\nBazida, and... Excuse me? (To his dad) Did you know this isn't Ma?"
Mr. Tribbiani	 Her name's Ronni. She's a pet mortician. "
Joey	 Sure. So how long you been... (Goes back to chopping)'
Mr. Tribbiani	 Remember when you were a little kid, I used to take you to the\nnavy yard and show you the big ships?'
Joey	 Since then?!'
Mr. Tribbiani	 No, it's only been six years. I just wanted to put a nice memory\nin your head so you'd know that I wasn't always such a terrible guy. ...Joe. Y'ever been\nin love?"
Joey	 ...I d'know."
Mr. Tribbiani	 Then y'haven't. You're burning your tomatoes."
Joey	 You're one to talk. (Puts the mushrooms in a saucepan)"
Mr. Tribbiani	 Joe, your dad's in love big time. And the worst part of it is,\nit's with two different women."
Joey	 Oh man. Please tell me one of 'em is Ma."
Mr. Tribbiani	 Of course, course one of 'em's Ma. What's the matter with you."
Joey	 It's like if you woke up one day and found out your dad was leading this\ndouble life. He's like actually some spy, working for the C.I.A. (Considers) That'd be\ncool.... This blows!"
Rachel	 I know, I mean, why can't parents just stay parents? (She walks over\nnear Chandler and his gaze stays very obviously on her chest) Why do they have to become\npeople? Why do they have... (Notices Chandler) Why can't you stop staring at my breasts?"
Chandler	 (Without looking up) What? (Looks up) What?'
Rachel	 Did you not get a good enough look the other day?'
Ross	 Alright, alright. We're all adults here, there's only one way to resolve\nthis. Since you saw her boobies, I think, uh, you're gonna have to show her your peepee."
Chandler	 Y'know, I don't see that happening?"
Rachel	 C'mon, he's right. Tit for tat."
Chandler	 Well I'm not showing you my 'tat.'"
Monica	 Hello?'
Phoebe	 (Intercom) It's Phoebe."
Roger	 (Intercom) And Rog.'
Monica	 C'mon up."
Chandler	 (Sarcastic) Oh, good. Rog is here.'
Joey	 What's the matter with Rog?"
Ross	 Yeah.'
Chandler	 Oh, it's nothing, it's a little thing... I hate that guy."
Ross	 What, so he was a little analytical. That's what he does, y'know? C'mon,\nhe's not that bad."
Ross	 Y'see, that's where you're wrong. Why would I marry her if I thought on\nany level thatthat she was a lesbian?"
Roger	 I dunno. Maybe you wanted your marriage to fail.'
Ross	 Why? Why would I why? Why? Why? Why?'
Roger	 I don't know. Maybe maybe low self-esteem, maybe maybe to compensate for\novershadowing a sibling, maybe you..."
Monica	 Wait-wait, go back to that sibling thing.'
Roger	 Well, I don't know. I mean, it's conceivable that you wanted to sabotage\nyour marriage so that the sibling would feel less of a failure in the eyes of the parents."
Ross	 That that's ridiculous! I don't feel guilty for her failures!"
Monica	 Oh! So you think I'm a failure!"
Phoebe	 Isn't he good?"
Ross	 Nonono, thatthat's not what I was saying..."
Monica	 Y'know, all these years, I thought you were on my side. But maybe what\nyou were doing was sucking up to Mom and Dad so they'd keep liking you better!"
Ross	 Hey, I married a lesbian to make you look good!'
Rachel	 You're right! I mean you're right! It wasn't just the Weebles, but it\nwas the Weeble Play Palace, and and the Weebles' Cruise Ship. Oh, which had this little\nlifeboat for the Weebles to wobble in. "
Roger	 That's tough. Tough stuff. C'mon, Pheebs, we're gonna catch that movie,\nwe gotta get going. "
Phoebe	 Oh, okay. Feel better, Rachel, 'kay?"
Roger	 Geez, we're gonna be late, sweetie..."
Phoebe	 Oh, okay. Listen, thanks for everything, Mon.'
Monica	 You're welcome."
Roger	 Listen guys, it was great seeing you again. Mon, um, easy on those\ncookies, okay? Remember, they're just food, they're not love."
Monica	 Hate that guy! (Throws another cookie)'
Joey	 Night, you guys.'
Chandler	 Oh look, it's the woman we ordered."
Joey	 Hey. Can, uh, can we help you?'
Ronni	 Oh, no thanks, I'm just waiting for, uh, Joey Tribbiani."
Joey	 I'm Joey Tribbiani."
Ronni	 Oh no, not you, big Joey. Oh my God, you're so much cuter than your\npictures! (Joey stares at her) I-I'm, I'm Ronni....Cheese Nip?"
Chandler	 Uh, Joey's having an embolism, but I'd go for a Nip, y'know?"

Ronni	 Now, y'see, most people, when their pets pass on, they want 'em sorta\nlaid out like they're sleeping. But occasionally you get your person who wants them in a\npose. Like, chasing their tail, (Demonstrates) or, uh, jumping to catch a frisbee."
Chandler	 Joey, if I go first, I wanna be looking for my keys.'
Ronni	 That's a good one!"
Mr. Tribbiani	 Hey, Joe.'
Joey	 Dad, Ronni's here."
Mr. Tribbiani	 Huh?'
Ronni	 Hi.'
Mr. Tribbiani	 Hey! Hello, babe! Wh what're what're you doing here?"
Ronni	 Oh, uh, well, you left your good hair at my apartment, I figured you'd\nneed it tomorrow for your meeting. (Hands him the hair)"
Mr. Tribbiani	 Thank you. Uh...'
Chandler	 So, who's up for a big game of Kerplunk?"
Ronni	 Look, I uh, I shouldn'ta come. I-I'd better get going, I don't wanna miss\nthe last train."
Mr. Tribbiani	 I don't want you taking that thing."
Ronni	 Oh, where'm I gonna stay, here?"
Joey	 Who-ah-ho.'
Mr. Tribbiani	 We'll go to a hotel."
Ronni	 (Shrugs) We'll go to a hotel."
Joey	 No you won't."
Ronni	 No we won't."
Joey	 If you go to a hotel you'll be...doing stuff. I want you right here where\nI can keep an eye on you."
Mr. Tribbiani	 You're gonna keep an eye on us?"
Joey	 That's right, mister, and I don't care how old you are, as long as you're\nunder my roof you're gonna live by my rules. And that means no sleeping with your\ngirlfriend."
Ronni	 Wow. He's strict."
Joey	 Now dad, you'll be in my room, Ronni uh, you can stay in Chandler's room."
Ronni	 Thanks. You're, uh, you're a good kid."
Chandler	 C\'mon, I\'ll show you to my room. ...That sounds so weird when it\'s not\nfollowed by "No thanks, it\'s late." '
Joey	 Okay. Now this is just for tonight. Starting tomorrow, you gotta make a\nchange. This has gone on long enough.'
Mr. Tribbiani	 What kinda change?'
Joey	 Well, either you break it off with Ronni'
Mr. Tribbiani	 I can't do that!"
Joey	 Then you gotta come clean with Ma! This is not right!'
Mr. Tribbiani	 Yeah, but this is'
Joey	 I don't wanna hear it! Now go to my room!"
Chandler	 Hey, Kicky. What're you doing?"
Joey	 Just trying to get comfortable. I can't sleep in my underwear. "
Chandler	 Well, you're gonna."
Joey	 I've been thinking. Y'know, about how I'm always seeing girls on top of\ngirls..."
Chandler	 Are they end to end, or tall like pancakes?'
Joey	 Y'know what I mean, about how I'm always going out with all these women.\nAnd I always figured, when the right one comes along, I'd be able to be a stand-up guy and\ngo the distance, y'know? Now I'm looking at my dad, thinking..."
Chandler	 Hey, you're not him. You're you. When they were all over you to go\ninto your father's pipe-fitting business, did you cave?"
Joey	 No.'
Chandler	 No. You decided to go into the out-of-work actor business. Now that\nwasn\'t easy, but you did it! And I\'d like to believe that when the right woman comes\nalong, you will have the courage and the guts to say "No thanks, I\'m married."'
Joey	 You really think so?'
Chandler	 Yeah. I really do.'
Joey	 Thanks, Chandler. (Snuggles up to him)'
Chandler	 Get off!'
Ronni	 Hi.'
Monica	 Hi...May I help you?'
Ronni	 Yeah, uh, Joey said I could use your shower, since, uh, Chandler's in\nours?"
Monica	 Okay...who are you?'
Ronni	 Oh, I'm Ronni. Ronni Rappelano? The mistress?"
Monica	 Oh, c'mon in."
Ronni	 Thanks.'
Rachel	 Hi, I'm Rachel."
Ronni	 Hi.'
Rachel	 Bathroom's up there."
Ronni	 Great.'
Rachel	 Hey, listen, Ronni, how long would you say Chandler's been in the\nshower?"
Ronni	 Oh, like, uh, five minutes?'
Rachel	 Perfect. Fasten your seatbelts, it's peepee time. (She goes into Joey\nand Chandler's apartment, where Mr. Tribbiani is reading the paper) Hey, Mr. Trib. "
Mr. Tribbiani	 Hey. Morning, dear.'
Rachel	 Chandler Bing? It's time to see your thing."
Joey	 (Runs out in a towel) What's the matter with you?!"
Rachel	 I thought it was Chandler!'
Chandler	 (Comes out of his room) What? What?'
Rachel	 You were supposed to be in there so I could see your thing!'
Chandler	 Sorry, my my thing was in there with me.'
All	 Hey, Pheebs.'
Phoebe	 Hey. '
Monica	 How's it going?"
Phoebe	 Good. Oh oh! Roger's having a dinner thing and he wanted me to invite\nyou guys."
Phoebe	 So what's going on?"
Monica	 Nothing, um, it's just, um... It's Roger. "
Ross	 I dunno, there's just something about..."
Chandler	 Basically we just feel that he's..."
Rachel	 We hate that guy.'
All	 Yeah. Hate him.'
Ross	 We're sorry, Pheebs, we're sorry."
Phoebe	 Uh-huh. Okay. Okay, don't you think, maybe, though, it's just that he's\nso perceptive that it freaks you out?"
All	 ...No, we hate him.'
Rachel	 We're sorry."
Joey	 Ma! What're you doing here?"
Mrs. Tribbiani	 I came to give you this (Gives him a bag of groceries) and this.\n(Whacks him round the ear)'
Joey	 Oww! Big ring!'
Mrs. Tribbiani	 Why did you have to fill your father's head with all that\ngarbage about making things right? Things were fine the way they were! There's chicken in\nthere, put it away. For God's sake, Joey, really. (She gives the sofabed a tiny push and\nit folds away)"
Joey	 Hold on, you-you knew?'
Mrs. Tribbiani	 Of course I knew! What did you think? Your father is no James\nBond. You should\'ve heard some of his cover stories. "I\'m sleeping over at my\naccountant\'s," I mean, what is that? Please!'
Joey	 So then how could you I mean, how could you?!'
Mrs. Tribbiani	 Do you remember how your father used to be? Always yelling,\nalways yelling nothing made him happy, nothing made him happy, not that wood shop, not\nthose stupid little ships in the bottle, nothing. Now he's happy! I mean, it's nice, he\nhas a hobby."
Joey	 Ma, I don't mean to be disrespectful, but... what the hell are you talking\nabout?! I mean, what about you?"
Mrs. Tribbiani	 Me? I'm fine. Look, honey, in an ideal world, there'd be no her,\nand your father would look like Sting. And I'll tell you something else. Ever since that\npoodle-stuffer came along, he's been so ashamed of himself that he's been more attentive,\nhe's been more loving... I mean, it's like every day's our anniversary."
Joey	 I'm...happy...for you?"
Mrs. Tribbiani	 Well don't be, because now everything's screwed up. I just want\nit the way it was."
Joey	 Ma, I'm sorry. I just did what I thought you'd want."
Mrs. Tribbiani	 I know you did, cookie. Oh, I know you did. So tell me. Did you\nsee her?'
Joey	 Yeah. You're ten times prettier than she is."
Mrs. Tribbiani	 That's sweet. Could I take her?"
Joey	 With this ring? (Her engagement ring.) No contest.'
Roger	 What's wrong, sweetie?"
Phoebe	 Nothing, nothing.'
Roger	 Aaaah, what's wrong, c'mon. (Pats his leg. She lies down and rests her\nhead in his lap)"
Phoebe	 It's, I mean, it's nothing, I'm fine. It's my friends. They-they have a\nliking problem with you. In that, um, they don't."
Roger	 Oh. They don't."
Phoebe	 But they don't see all the wonderfulness that I see. They don't see all\nthe good stuff and all the sweet stuff. They just think you're a little..."
Roger	 What?'
Phoebe	 Intense and creepy. '
Roger	 Oh.'
Phoebe	 But I don't. Me, Phoebe."
Roger	 Well, I'm not I'm not at all surprised they feel that way."
Phoebe	 You're not? See, that's why you're so great! "
Roger	 Actually it's, it's quite, y'know, typical behaviour when you have this\nkind of dysfunctional group dynamic. Y'know, this kind of co-dependant, emotionally\nstunted, sitting in your stupid coffee house with your stupid big cups which, I'm sorry,\nmight as well have nipples on them, and you're like all 'Oh, define me! Define me! Love\nme, I need love!'."
Monica	 So you talked to your dad, huh.'
Joey	 Yeah. He's gonna keep cheating on my ma like she wanted, she's gonna keep\npretending she doesn't know even though she does, and my little sister Tina can't see her\nhusband any more because he got a restraining order...which has nothing to do with\nanything except that I found out today."
Rachel	 Wow.'
Chandler	 Things sure have changed here on Waltons mountain.'
Ross	 So Joey, you okay?'
Joey	 Yeah, I guess. It's just parents, after a certain point, you gotta let go.\nEven if you know better, you've gotta let them make their own mistakes."
Rachel	 Just think, in a couple of years we get to turn into them.'
Chandler	 If I turn into my parents, I'll either be an alcoholic blond chasing\nafter twenty-year-old boys, or... I'll end up like my mom."
Phoebe	 (entering) Hey.'
All	 Hey, Pheebs.'
Monica	 How's it going?"
Phoebe	 Oh, okay, except I broke up with Roger.'
All	 Awww.'
Phoebe	 Yeah, right.'
All	 Aaawwwwww!!'
Rachel	 What happened?'
Phoebe	 I don't know, I mean, he's a good person, and he can be really sweet,\nand in some ways I think he is so right for me, it's just... I hate that guy!"

Phoebe	 Hey, Joey. What's going on?"
Joey	 Clear the tracks for the boobie payback express. Next stop
Monica	 Joey!! What the hell were you doing?!'
Joey	 Sorry. Wrong boobies.'
Monica	 Hello, Joey.'
Mr. Tribbiani	 Oh! ...Hello, dear. (She whips the curtain shut in horror)'
