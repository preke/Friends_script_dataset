Ross	 She's not here yet. She's not here. She's having my baby and she's not\nhere."
Monica	 I'm sure everything's fine. Has her water broke yet?"
Ross	 I don't know, but when I spoke to her, she said she had already passed the\nmucus plug."
Joey	 Do we have to know about that?'
Monica	 Joey, what are you gonna do when you have a baby?'
Joey	 I'm gonna be in the waitin' room, handing out cigars."
Chandler	 Yes, Joey's made arrangements to have his baby in a movie from the\n50's."
Ross	 God, I don't believe this. She could be giving birth in the cab."
Rachel	 Oh, Ross, relax. It's probably like two dollars for the first\ncontraction, and then fifty cents for each additional contraction."
Rachel	 What, it's ok when Chandler does it?"
Chandler	 You have to pick your moments.'
Phoebe	 Did I miss it, did I miss it?'
Ross	 She's not even here yet."
Monica	 What's with the guitar?"
Phoebe	 I just thought we might be here for awhile. You know, things might get\nmusical.'
Ross	 (to Carol) Where the hell have you been?'
Susan	 We stopped at the gift shop.'
Carol	 I was looking at stuffed animals, and Susan wanted a Chunky.'
Ross	 Susan wanted a Chunky. We're having a baby, ok, a baby, you don't\nstop for Chunkys."
Chandler	 I used to have that bumper sticker.'
Chandler	 (to Rachel) You see what I mean.'

Ross	 Stopped for a Chunky.'
Carol	 Let it go, Ross.'
Susan	 I got an extra one. You want this? (holds the candy in front of Ross'\nface)"
Ross	 (weakly) No.'
Dr. Franzblau	 Hey, how's my favorite parenting team doing?"
Ross	 Dr. Franzblau, hi.'
Dr. Franzblau	 So, I understand you're thinking of having a baby? Well, I see\nyou're nine months pregnant. That's a good start. How you doing with your contractions?"
Carol	 Oh, I love them. Each one's like a little party in my uterus."
Susan	 They're every four minutes and last 55 seconds."
Ross	 59 seconds. (holds up his watch) Quartz, ha.'
Susan	 Swiss quartz, ha, ha.'
Carol	 Am I allowed to drink anything?'
Dr. Franzblau	 Ice chips, just ice chips. They're at the nurses' station."
Ross	 I'll get it."
Susan	 No, I'm getting it. I'll be right back."
Ross	 I got it\xc2\x97I'm getting it!"
Rachel	 Hi, I thought you might like some ice chips.'
Carol	 Thanks.'
Rachel	 And if you need anything else, I\xc2\x97(notices the handsome Dr.\nFranzblau)\xc2\x97do not believe we've met. Hi. I'm, uh, Rachel Green. I'm Carol's...\nex-husband's... sister's roommate. "
Dr. Franzblau	 It is nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Franzblau. I'm your roommate's...\nbrother's... ex-wife's obstetrician."
Rachel	 Oh, that's funny!"
Monica	 I want a baby.'
Chandler	 Mmmm. Not tonight, honey. I got an early day tomorrow.'
Monica	 Get up. Come on. Let's get some coffee."
Chandler	 Oh, ok, 'cause we never do that."
Joey	 (to the screen) Shoot! Shoot! Shoot! Shoot, or just fall down. That's good\ntoo."
Lydia	 Knick fan?'
Joey	 Oh, yeah.'
Lydia	 Oh, boy, do they suck.'
Joey	 Hey, listen, lady....(sees that she's pregnant)...whoa."
Lydia	 Look, look at your man, Ewing. Nice shot. You know what, he couldn't hit\nwater if he was standing on a boat."
Joey	 Oh yeah? And who do you like?'
Lydia	 The Celtics.'
Joey	 The Celtics? Ha. They couldn't hit a boat if...wait. They suck, alright?"
Lydia	 Oh, shut up. You know, it's a rebuilding year. You... waah!"
Joey	 Wha? Wha..aa? Let me get the father. Hey, we need a father over here! We\nneed a father!'
Lydia	 There is no father.'
Joey	 Oh, oh, oh, sorry.'
Lydia	 Ok, that's ok. I'm fine. I'm... oh!"
Joey	 Oh, uh, ok. Right this way. All the other pregnant women seem to be goin'\nin here."
Lydia	 Ok.'
Phoebe	 (singing) '
Phoebe	 Thanks, Ross.'
Ross	 Yeah. I'm paying you to stop."
Phoebe	 Ok.'
Phoebe	 Oh, look, twins. Hi, guys. Oh, cute, cute.'
Monica	 No fair. I don't even have one. How come they get two?"
Chandler	 You'll get one."
Monica	 Oh yeah? When?'
Chandler	 All right. I'll tell you what. When we're 40, if neither one of us are\nmarried, what do you say you and I get together and have one?"
Monica	 Why won't I be married when I'm 40?"
Chandler	 Oh, no, no. I just meant hypothetically.'
Monica	 Ok, hypothetically, why won't I be married when I'm 40?"
Chandler	 No, no, no.'
Monica	 What is it? Is there something fundamentally unmarriable about me?'
Chandler	 (trapped) Uh, uh.'
Monica	 Well?'
Chandler	 Dear God! This parachute is a knapsack! (throws himself over the back\nof the chair he was sitting in)'
Rachel	 Hey.'
Phoebe	 Hey. Ooh, look at you, dressy-dress.'
Monica	 Did you go home and change?'
Rachel	 Yeah, well, it's an important day. I wanna look nice. Um, has uh Dr.\nFranzblau been by?"
Monica	 No, I haven't seen him."
Rachel	 Well, where is he? He is supposed to be here. (Pause) What if the baby\nneeds him?'
Chandler	 Rachel, what is the deal with you and doctors, anyway? Was, like, your\nfather a doctor? '
Rachel	 Yeah, why?'
Chandler	 No reason. (turns around, makes an 'Oh my God' gesture with his eyes)"
Lydia	 Mom, we've been through this. No, I'm not calling him. I don't care if it\nis his kid, the guy's a jerk. No, I'm not alone. Joey's here. (pause) What do you mean,\nJoey who? (covers the phone, to Joey) Joey who?"
Joey	 Tribbiani.'
Lydia	 Joey Tribbiani. Yes, ok. Hold on. (to Joey) She wants to talk to you.\nTake the phone.'
Joey	 (takes phone) Hi, yeah, it's me. (Listens) Oh, no no no, we're just\nfriends. (Listens) Yeah, I'm single. (Listens) 25. (Listens) An actor. (Listens) Hello?"
Lydia	 She's not much of a phone person."
Joey	 Yeah, so, uh, so, uh, what's the deal with this father guy, I mean, if\nsomeone was havin' my baby somewhere, I'd wanna know about it, you know?"
Lydia	 Hey, Knick fan, am I interested in your views on fatherhood? Uh, no. '
Joey	 Ok, look, maybe I should just go.'
Lydia	 Maybe you should.'
Joey	 Good luck, and uh, take care, huh? '
Joey	 You know what the Celtics problem is? They let the players run the team.'
Lydia	 Oh, that is so not true.'
Joey	 Oh, it is.'
Lydia	 It isn't."
Joey	 It is.'
Lydia	 Isn't!"
Ross	 Breathe.'
Susan	 Breathe.'
Ross	 Breathe.'
Susan	 Breathe.'
Ross	 Breathe.'
Susan	 Breathe.'
Carol	 You're gonna kill me!"
Ross	 15 more seconds, 14, 13, 12...'
Carol	 Count faster.'
Susan	 It's gonna be ok, just remember, we're doing this for Jordie. Just keep\nfocusing on Jordie."
Ross	 Who the hell is Jordie?'
Susan	 Your son.'
Ross	 No-no-no. I don't have a son named Jordie. We all agreed, my son's name is\nJamie."
Carol	 Well, Jamie was the name of Susan's first girlfriend, so we went back to\nJordie."
Ross	 What? Whoa, whoa whoa whoa, what do you mean, back to Jordie? We\nnever landed on Jordie. We just passed by it during the whole Jessy, Cody, Dylan\nfiasco.'
Carol	 Ow, ow, ow, ow, leg cramp, leg cramp, leg cramp.'
Ross	 I got it.'
Susan	 I got it.'
Ross	 I got it! Hey, you get to sleep with her, I get the cramps.'
Susan	 No, you don't."
Carol	 All right, that's it. I want both of you out."
Ross	 Why?'
Susan	 He started it!'
Ross	 No, you started it.'
Susan	 You did!'
Carol	 I don't care. I am trying to get a person out of my body here, and you're\nnot making it any easier."
Ross	 But...'
Carol	 Now go!'
Ross	 (to Susan) Thanks a lot.'
Susan	 (to Ross) See what you did.'
Ross	 (to Carol) Yeah, listen...'
Carol	 Out! '
Nurse	 Breathe, breathe, breathe...'
Lydia	 Oh, no.'
Joey	 Ew! What is that? Something exploded!'
Nurse	 It's just her water breaking. Calm down, will you?"
Joey	 (panicked) Water breaking, what do you mean? What's that, water breaking?"
Nurse	 (to Joey) Breathe, breathe, breathe.'
Ross	 Please. This is so your fault.'
Susan	 How, how is this my fault?'
Ross	 Look, Carol never threw me out of a room before you came along.'
Susan	 Yeah? Well, there's a lot of things Carol never did before I came along."
Ross	 You tryin' to be clever? A funny lady?"
Susan	 You know what your problem is? You're threatened by me."
Ross	 Oh, I'm threatened by you?"
Susan	 Yes.'
Phoebe	 Hey, hey, ok, all right, that's it! Get in here. Come on. My god, you\nguys, I don't believe you. There are children coming into the world in this very building\nand your negative fighting noises are not the first thing they should be hearing. So just\nstop all the yelling, just stop it!"
Ross	 Yeah, Susan.'
Phoebe	 Don't make me do this again, I don't like my voice like this."
Phoebe	 Ok, who wants to hear something ironic?'

All	 Help!'
Ross	 I'm having a baby in here! Ok, everyone stand back. (Walks backwards as if\nhe is going to break down the door, but steps in a bucket and falls) Ow."
Carol	 Are they here yet?'
Rachel	 No, honey, they're not, but don't worry, because we are going to find\nthem, and until we do, we are all here for you, ok?"
Carol	 Ok.'
Rachel	 Ok?'
Carol	 Ok.'
Rachel	 (to Dr. Franzblau) Ok, so anyway, you were telling me about Paris, it\nsounds fascinating.'
Dr. Franzblau	 It really was. There was this great little pastry shop right by\nmy hotel. (Carol sits up in pain, Rachel and Dr. Franzblau casually lay her back down)\nThere you go, dear. '
Joey	 Come on, Lydia, you can do it. Push! Push 'em out, push 'em out, harder,\nharder. Push 'em out, push 'em out, way out! Let's get that ball and really move, hey,\nhey, ho, ho. Let's\xc2\x97 (notices the nurse looking at him strangely) I was\njust\xc2\x97yeah, right. Push! Push! "
Susan	 What're you gonna do, suck the door open?"
Ross	 Help! Help!'
Phoebe	 (singing) They found their bodies the very next day, they found their\nbodies the very next...(sees Ross and Susan staring at her) la la la la la la.'
Susan and Ross	 (even louder) Help!'
Monica	 Now, Mom, everything's going fine, really. (Listens) Yeah, Ross is\ngreat. He's uh, he's in a whole other place. (Listens) No, he's gone. (Listens) No no, you\ndon't have to fly back, really. (Listens) What do you mean this might be your only chance?\n(Listens) Would you stop? I'm only 26, I'm not even thinking about babies yet. "
Chandler	 Where have you been?'
Joey	 Oh, just had a baby.'
Chandler	 Mazel tov!'
Dr. Franzblau	 I don't know, could be an hour, could be three, but relax, she's\ndoing great. So, uh, tell me, are you currently involved with anyone?"
Rachel	 (anxiously) No, no, not at the moment, no, I'm not. Are you?"
Dr. Franzblau	 No, it's hard enough to get women to go out with me."
Rachel	 Right, yeah, I've heard that about cute doctors."
Dr. Franzblau	 No, no, really. I suppose it's because I spend so much time, you\nknow, where I do."
Rachel	 Oh.'
Dr. Franzblau	 I try not to let my work affect my personal life, but it's hard,\nwhen you... do what I do. It's like uh...Well, for instance, what do you do?"
Rachel	 I'm a waitress."
Dr. Franzblau	 Ok, all right, well aren't there times when you come home at the\nend of the day, and you're just like, 'if I see one more cup of coffee'..."
Rachel	 (getting the point) Yeah. Gotcha.'
Dr. Franzblau	 I'm gonna go check up on your friend."
Rachel	 Ok. That's fine. (takes her earrings out)"
Lydia	 So how did you know I was even here?'
Guy	 Your mom called me. So is this her?'
Lydia	 No, this is a loaner.'
Guy	 I'm sorry you had to do this by yourself."
Lydia	 I wasn't by myself. I had a doctor, a nurse, and a helper guy. (Joey\nsmiles) So, did you see who won the game?"
Guy	 Yeah, the Knicks by 10. They suck.'
Lydia	 Yeah, they're not so bad."
Ross	 Come on, come on. Damnit, damnit, damnit, damnit. (to Susan) This is all\nyour fault. This is supposed to be, like, the greatest day of my life, y'know? My son is\nbeing born, and I should be in there, you know, instead of stuck in a closet with you."
Susan	 The woman I love is having a baby today. I've been waiting for this just\nas much as you have."
Ross	 No no no, believe me. No one has been waiting for this as much as I have,\nok? And you know what the funny thing is? When this day is over, you get to go home with\nthe baby, ok? Where does that leave me?'
Susan	 You get to be the baby's father. Everyone knows who you are. Who am I?\nThere's Mother's Day, there's Father's Day, there's no... Lesbian Lover Day."
Ross	 Every day is Lesbian Lover Day.'
Phoebe	 This is so great.'
Ross	 You wanna explain that?'
Phoebe	 I mean, well, 'cause when I was growing up, you know my dad left, and my\nmother died, and my stepfather went to jail, so I barely had enough pieces of parents to\nmake one whole one. And here's this little baby who has like three whole parents who care\nabout it so much that they're fighting over who gets to love it the most. And it's not\neven born yet. It's just, it's just the luckiest baby in the whole world. (pause) I'm\nsorry, you were fighting."
Carol	 Where are they?'
Monica	 I'm sure they'll be here soon."
Rachel	 Yeah, honey, they wouldn't miss this."
Joey	 Relax. You're only at nine centimeters. And the baby's at zero station."
Chandler	 (to Joey) You are really frightening me.'
Chandler	 Somebody wanna help me, tryin' to rip out my heart. (they pull her\nhand off of him) Uh, that's great. (looking around) Anybody seen a nipple?"
Dr. Franzblau	 All right, ten centimeters, here we go.'
Nurse	 All right, honey, time to start pushing.'
Carol	 But they're not here yet!"
Dr. Franzblau	 I'm sorry, I can't tell the baby to wait for them."
Carol	 Oh, god.'
Ross	 Ok, got the vent open.'
Phoebe	 (reading the nametag on the uniform) Hi, I'm Ben. I'm hospital worker\nBen. It's Ben... to the rescue!"
Ross	 Ben, you ready? All right, gimme your foot. Ok, on three, Ben. One, two,\nthree. Ok, That's it, Ben."
Susan	 What do you see?'
Phoebe	 Well, Susan, I see what appears to be a dark vent. Wait. Yes, it is in\nfact a dark vent.'
Ross	 Phoebs, It's open! It's open!"
Janitor	 (to Ross and Susan) Wait! You forgot your legs!'
All	 Push, push!'
Ross	 We're here!"
Carol	 (irked) Where have you been?'
Ross	 Long story, honey.'
Dr. Franzblau	 All right, Carol, I need you to keep pushing. I\nneed\xc2\x97(reaches for an instrument, Rachel's hand is on it) Excuse me, could I have\nthis?"
Nurse	 All right, all right, there's a few too many people in this room, and\nthere's about to be one more, so anybody who's not an ex-husband or a lesbian life\npartner, out you go!"
All	 Good luck!'
Chandler	 (to nurse) Let me ask you, do you have to be Carol's lesbian life\npartner?"
Nurse	 Out!'
Dr. Franzblau	 All right, he's crowning. Here he comes."
Ross	 Let me see, I gotta see, I gotta see. Oh, a head. Oh, it's, it's huge.\nCarol, how are you doing this?"
Carol	 (straining) Not.... helping!'
Dr. Franzblau	 You're doing great, you're doing fine. "
Ross	 (puts his head near the baby) Hello! (to Dr. Franzblau) Oh, sorry.'
Susan	 What do you see? What do you see?'
Ross	 We got a head, we got shoulders, we got arms, we got, oh, look at the\nlittle fingers, oh, and a chest, and a stomach. It's a boy, definitely a boy! All right!\nOk, legs, knees, and feet. Oh, oh. He's here. He's a person."
Susan	 Oh, look at that.'
Carol	 What does he look like?'
Ross	 Kinda like my uncle Ed, covered in Jell-o.'
Carol	 Really?'
Phoebe	 (from the air vent overhead) You guys, he's beautiful!"
Ross	 Oh, thanks, Pheebs!'
Susan	 No shouting, but we still need a name for this little guy.'
Ross	 (thinking) How 'bout Ben?"
Susan	 I like Ben.'
Carol	 Ben. Ben. Ben's good. How come you never mentioned Ben before?"
Ross	 We uh, we just cooked it up.'
Susan	 That's what we were off doing."
Monica	 Hi.'
Ross	 Hey.'
Monica	 Can we come in?'
Ross	 (to Ben) I know, I know. Everybody, there's someone I'd like you to meet.\nYeah. This is Ben. Ben, this is everybody."
Phoebe	 Susan, he looks just like you.'
Susan	 Thanks.'
Rachel	 Oh, god, I can't believe one of us actually has one of these."
Chandler	 I know, I still am one of these.'
Monica	 Ross, can I?'
Ross	 The head, the head. You gotta...'
Monica	 (getting choked up) Hi, Ben. Hi. I'm your Aunt Monica. Yes I am. I'm\nyour Aunt Monica. I...I will always have gum."

Ross	 Ben, I want you to know that there may be some times when I may not be\naround, like this. (walks out of the picture) But I'll still always come back, like this.\n(returns) And sometimes I may be away longer, like this. (walks away) But I'll still\nalways come back, like this. (returns) "
Chandler	 And sometimes, I'll want you to steal third, and I'll go like this.\n(Does a baseball sign.)"
Monica	 He is so amazing.'
Rachel	 Oh, I know. Look at him.'
Joey	 Ben, Ben, hey Ben. Nothing. I don't think that's his name."
Phoebe	 Oh, look, look, he's closing his eyes. (screen goes blank) Look, he's\nopening his eyes. (picture comes back) "
Joey	 He doesn't do much, does he?"
Ross	 No, this is pretty much it.'
Rachel	 You guys wanna get some coffee?'
All	 Yeah.'
Ross	 All right, I'll see you guys later."
Phoebe	 Oh, look, he's closing his eyes again."
