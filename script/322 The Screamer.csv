Joey	 (Checks to see if she\xc2\x92s drooling on his shirt.) Okay. Okay, okay,\nhey. (Lays her down and covers her with a blanket.) There we go, let\xc2\x92s get your feet\nup there. (Looks at her) Good night, Kate. Sweet dreams. (Picks up a garbage can) I\xc2\x92m\ngonna put this can right here in case you have to hurl.'
