Rachel	 Hi!'
Ross	 Hey!'
Monica	 Hey!'
Rachel	 So, I\xc2\x92m in my apartment doing the Soap Opera Digest\ncrossword puzzle, and guess who the clue is for three down. (She hands the magazine to\nJoey.)'
Joey	 (reading) Three down, Days Of Our Lives star blank Tribbiani.\nThat\xc2\x92s me!! I\xc2\x92m blank!!'
Monica	 How cool is this?! We know three down! I\xc2\x92m touching three down!\n(She has her hand on his shoulder.)'
Joey	 Yeah you are baby.'
Monica	 Three down knows I\xc2\x92m married, what\xc2\x92s three down doin\xc2\x92?'
Rachel	 So did they call you to tell you your name\xc2\x92s gonna be in this?'
Joey	 No. They really like me over there. They want to do a big profile on me,\nbut I said no.'
Ross	 Why\xc2\x92d you say no?'
Joey	 Remember what happened the last time I did an interview for them? I said I\nwrite a lot of my own lines, and then the writers got mad and made my character fall down\nthe elevator shaft. So who knows what I might say this time.'
Chandler	 If only there was something in your head to control the things\nyou say. (Joey nods his agreement.)'
Rachel	 Oh, come on Joey! You will totally keep it in check this time, and plus\ny\xc2\x92know the publicity would be really good for your career! And you deserve that! And\nif you do the interview you can mention, oh I don\xc2\x92t know, gal pal Rachel Green?'
Chandler	 Is that gal pal spelled L-O-S-E-R?'
Rachel	 Okay, don\xc2\x92t listen to him. Please?'
Joey	 Fine! All right, I\xc2\x92ll do it. But hey! You guys have to be at the next\ntable so you can stop me if I y\xc2\x92know, start to say something stupid.'
Ross	 Just then or-or all the time, \xc2\x91cause we-we have jobs y\xc2\x92know.'
Rachel	 Come on! We will be there for you the whole time! Just remember gal pal\nRachel Green. (Excited) Ha-ha! I\xc2\x92m gonna be in Soap Opera Digest! And not just\nin the dumb crossword puzzle. (Looks at Joey.) Seriously, proud of you.'
Joey	 Yeah.'

The Interviewer	 I really appreciate you taking the time to do this.'
Joey	 Oh, not at all. Happy to do it.'
Monica	 (To Chandler) You think we\xc2\x92re being obvious?'
Chandler	 No, we\xc2\x92re just four people with neck problems. You talk like\nthis. (Out of the sides of their mouths.)'
The Interviewer	 (To Joey) Y\xc2\x92know I think its great you wanted to meet\nhere. Y\xc2\x92know when most people hear the magazine is paying for it they want to go to a\nbig fancy restaurant.'
Joey	 (laughs) Actually, I didn\xc2\x92t know the magazine was paying for it.\nWouldn\xc2\x92t have mattered, I\xc2\x92m doing this for the fans, not for the free food.'
Gunther	 Can I get you anything?'
The Interviewer	 Umm, I\xc2\x92ll have a cup of coffee.'
Joey	 And I\xc2\x92ll have all the muffins.'
Phoebe	 (entering) Hey!'
Ross	 Shhh! We\xc2\x92re not talking.'
Phoebe	 Oh. Finally! Oh. (Sits back in relief.)'
The Interviewer	 So, according to your bio, you\xc2\x92ve done quite a bit of work\nbefore Days of Our Lives. Anything you\xc2\x92re particularly proud of?'
Joey	 (He goes into a song and dance number) '
Joey	 Oh, you said it Mike. (Rips open the carton and spills milk on the\ncounter) Aw! There's got to be a better way!"
Joey	 (finishing installing the Milk Master 2000) Wow, it is easy. (Starts\nto poor the milk) Now, I can have milk everyday.'
Joey	 Yeah, I guess it is. And so\xc2\x85 I\xc2\x92m gonna get on this\nspaceship, (Smoke starts pouring in from the ceiling, and a ladder comes down, with\nflashing, colored lights on the side of it) and I\xc2\x92m gonna go to Blargon 7 in search\nof alternative fuels. But when I return, 200 years from now, you\xc2\x92ll be long gone. But\nI won\xc2\x92t have aged at all. (Gets on the ladder) So you tell your\ngreat-great-granddaughter to look me up, because Adrienne\xc2\x85 baby\xc2\x85I\xc2\x92m gonna\nwant to meet her. '
Joey	 Shh, OK, here I come, here I come. See I'm comin' to fix the copier, I\ncan't get to the copier, I'm thinkin' what do I do, what do I do\xc2\x85so I just watch 'em\nhave sex. And then I say, wait, here's my line, (Joey from TV) you know that's bad for\nthe paper tray."
Chandler	 Nice work my friend.'
Joey	 Thank you. Wait-wait-wait-wait, you see me again. Hang on, the guy's\nbutt's blockin' me. There I am, there I am, there I am, there I am, there I am\xc2\x85"
Joey	 Well, there are so many things, it\xc2\x92s hard to pick just one.'
Phoebe	 I\xc2\x92m gonna get some coffee, anyone want anything?'
Rachel	 Oh yeah, I\xc2\x92d actually love a blueberry muffin and a chamomile tea.'
Ross	 Uh, double latte, extra foam.'
Chandler	 And a bagel with only\xc2\x85'
Phoebe	 (interrupting him) I was just being polite!'
The Interviewer	 Okay, how about when you\xc2\x92re not working. What do you do in\nyour spare time?'
Joey	 (drinking a beer) Look at this clown! Just because he\xc2\x92s got a\nbigger boat he thinks he can take up the whole river. (Yelling) Get out of the way\njackass! (To Rachel) Who names their boat Coast Guard anyway?'
Rachel	 That is the Coast Guard. '
Joey	 What are they doing out here? The coast\xc2\x92s all the way over there.\n(Points to the coast.)'
Chandler	 (entering) Hey!'
Phoebe	 Hey! Check it out! This is unbelievable! Joey has been holding his\nbreath for almost four minutes! '
Joey	 (To Chandler) Dude! What are yo\xc2\x97you trying to kill me?!'
Chandler	 Well, I see you've had a very productive day. Don't you think the\ncowboy hat is a little much?"
Ross	 (popping up behind Joey wearing an Indian headdress) Come on, it's\nfun!"
Chandler	 All right! (He joins them in the fort and comes up putting on a\nbonnet.) Isn't this a woman's hat?"
Joey	 Dude, stop talking crazy and make us some tea!'
Chandler	 Y\xc2\x92know what, we have to turn off the porn.'
Joey	 I think you\xc2\x92re right.'
Chandler	 All right, ready?'
Joey	 One.'
Chandler	 Two.'
Joey	 That\xc2\x92s kinda nice.'
Chandler	 Yeah, that\xc2\x92s kinda a relief.'
Joey	 Yeah.'
Chandler	 You wanna see if we still have it?'
Joey	 Yeah.'
Chandler	 FREE PORN!!!'
Joey	 Yeah!!'
Chandler	 We have free porn here!!!'
Joey	 In my spare time I uh, read to the blind. And I\xc2\x92m also a mento for\nthe kids.(The gang shake their heads.) Y\xc2\x92know a mento, a role model. (Chandler bites\nhis fist to keep from talking.)'
The Interviewer	 A mento\xc2\x85'
Joey	 Right.'
The Interviewer	 Like the candy?'
Joey	 Matter of fact, I do.'
The Interviewer	 Well umm, another thing our readers always want to know is how\nour soap stars stay in such great shape. Do you have some kind of fitness regime?'
Joey	 Uh, we stars just try to eat right and get lots of exercise.'
Joey	 Wow! You realize that we've been throwing this ball, without dropping\nit, for like an hour?"
Ross	 Are you serious?!'
Joey	 Yeah. I realized it about a half-hour ago but I didn't want to say\nanything 'cause I didn't want to jinx it."
Ross	 Wow! We are pretty good at this!'
Joey	 Yeah!'
Ross	 Hey! We totally forgot about lunch!'
Joey	 Oh, I-I, I think that's the first time I ever missed a meal! (Checks\nhis pants.) Yeah, my pants are a little loose!"
Chandler	 What\xc2\x92s wrong with you?'
Joey	 Nothing! Well, I-I got this blinding pain in my stomach when I was\nlifting weights before, then I uh passed out and uh, haven\xc2\x92t been able to stand up\nsince. But um, I don\xc2\x92t think it\xc2\x92s anything serious.'
Chandler	 This sounds like a hernia. You have to\xc2\x97you-you\xc2\x97Go to the\ndoctor!'
Joey	 No way! \xc2\x91Kay look, if I have to go to the doctor for anything\nit\xc2\x92s gonna be for this thing sticking out of my stomach! (Rolls over and shows\nChandler.) Why did I have to start working out again? (Looks at the weights he was using.)\nDamn you 15s!'
Rachel	 It\xc2\x92s a trifle. It\xc2\x92s got all of these layers. First\nthere\xc2\x92s a layer of ladyfingers, then a layer of jam, then custard, which I made from\nscratch. [Joey and Ross make impressed faces] Then raspberries, more ladyfingers, then\nbeef saut\xc3\xa9ed with peas and onions, [Joey and Ross look like something\xc2\x92s wrong.] then\na little more custard, and then bananas, and then I just put some whipped cream on top!'

Ross	 It tastes like feet!'
Joey	 I like it.'
Ross	 Are you kidding?'
Joey	 What\xc2\x92s not to like? Custard? Good. Jam? Good. Meat? Goooooood.'
Joey	 The fridge broke. I have to eat everything. Cold cuts, ice cream,\nlimes\xc2\x97Hey, what was in that brown jar?'
Chandler	 That\xc2\x92s still in there?!'
Joey	 Not anymore. '
Rachel	 Oh! Yay! Look! There\xc2\x92s a piece that doesn\xc2\x92t have floor on\nit!'
Chandler	 Stick to your side!'
Rachel	 Hey, come on now!'
Joey	 (pulls out a fork) All right, what are we havin\xc2\x92? (Starts digging\nin.)'
Joey	 Uhh, I don\xc2\x92t believe in these crazy diets y\xc2\x92know, just\neverything in moderation.'
Gunther	 Your muffins. (Sets down a huge plate of muffins in front of\nJoey.)'
Joey	 I\xc2\x92ll take those to go. (To the interviewer) For the kids.'
The Interviewer	 Oh, I know what I wanted to ask you. You were on the show years\nago and then they killed you off. What happened there?'
Joey	 It was so stupid, I said some stuff in an interview that I shouldn\xc2\x92t\nhave said. But believe me, that\xc2\x92s not gonna happen today.'
The Interviewer	 Understood. So, what\xc2\x92d you say back then?'
Joey	 Well, I said that I\xc2\x85 (The gang jumps up and interrupts him.)'

Joey	 You guys, this is Shelley, she\xc2\x92s interviewing me for Soap Opera\nDigest, and Shelley, this are my friends\xc2\x85'
Rachel	 (interrupting him) Hi! I\xc2\x92m gal pal Rachel Green, and if you want\nthe dirt, I\xc2\x92m the one you come too. This might be Joey\xc2\x92s baby (rubbing her\nstomach), who knows? I\xc2\x92m just kidding\xc2\x97Seriously, (leans into the cassette\nrecorder Shelley is using) gal pal Rachel Green.'
Ross	 (leaning into the recorder as well) Who just lost the respect of her\nunborn child.'
The Interviewer	 Umm, I\xc2\x92m gonna just go get this warmed up. (She takes her\ncoffee mug up to the counter.)'
Joey	 Okay.'
Monica	 Joey! You\xc2\x92re doing great!'
Ross	 Yeah, so far nothing stupid.'
Chandler	 Mento?'
Joey	 No thanks.'
The Interviewer	 (returning) So, as Joey\xc2\x92s friends, is there anything that\nyou guys think our readers ought to know?'
Ross	 Uh no, no just-just that he is a great guy.'
Rachel	 (scoffs at him) Yeah, that\xc2\x92s gonna get you into Soap Opera\nDigest. Well I\xc2\x85(leans into the microphone again)\xc2\x85I would just like to say\nthat Joey truly has enriched the days of our lives.'
Phoebe	 Umm, I\xc2\x85I just think you don\xc2\x92t expect someone so hot to be so\nsweet.'
The Interviewer	 Oh! I like that. What\xc2\x92s your name?'
Phoebe	 Umm, Phoebe Buffay.'
The Interviewer	 How do you spell that? So we can get it right.'
Phoebe	 Oh okay, it\xc2\x92s P as in Phoebe, H as in hoebe, O as in oebe, E as in\nebe, B as in bee-bee and E as in (In an Australian accent) \xc2\x91Ello there mate!'

The Interviewer	 So it seems like you have a lot of friends, who would you say\nis your best friend?'
Joey	 How come you have two?\n\nChandler
Rachel	 Oh, Joey! Sorry!'
Joey	 No that\xc2\x92s all right. Don\xc2\x92t worry about it.'
Rachel	 Oh but look! That\xc2\x92s gonna leave a stain! '
Joey	 Rach! Hey! It\xc2\x92s fine! You\xc2\x92re at Joey\xc2\x92s!'
Rachel	 Really?'
Joey	 Yeah! Look! (He throws some of his spaghetti on the floor.)'
Rachel	 I\xc2\x92ve never lived like this before.'
Joey	 I know.'
Joey	 All right, don\xc2\x92t waste it, I mean its still food. (He picks it up and\neats it.)'
Ross	 All right I've been feeling incredibly guilty about this, because I wanna\nbe a good friend, and damnit I am a good friend. So just, just shut up and close your eyes\n(kisses Joey)."
Joey	 Wow, you are a good friend, 'course the audition was this morning, and I\ndidn't get it. But that was a hell of a kiss. Rachel is a very lucky girl."
Joey	 All right. Let's get the contestants out of their isolation booths.\n(He removes the waste bucket that's over the duck and the laundry basket that's over the\nchicken.) And they're off! (He puts his foot in front of the chick, stopping it from\nmoving.)"
Phoebe	 Get your foot off my contestant! Judge!'
Joey	 Judge rules, no violation.'
Phoebe	 Ohhh.'
Joey	 And the duck gets the Nutter-Butter!'
Phoebe	 (turning from Ross.) No!! Hey-hey that's not a Nutter-Butter, that's\njust an old Wonton!"
Joey	 Judge rules, Nutter-Butter.'
Phoebe	 Ohh, tough call.'
Joey	 Yeah.'
Joey	 I\xc2\x92d seen this thing on The Discovery Channel...'
Ross	 Wait a minute! I saw that! On The Discovery Channel, yeah!\nAbout jellyfish and how if you... (Stops suddenly and turns to look at Monica) Ewwww!! You\npeed on yourself?!'
Phoebe and Rachel	 Ewwww!!'
Monica	 You can\xc2\x92t say that!! You-you don\xc2\x92t know!! I mean I thought\nI was gonna pass out from the pain! Anyway I-I tried, but I-I couldn\xc2\x92t...bend that\nway. So... (Looks at Joey.)'
Phoebe, Ross, and Rachel	 (turning to look at Joey) Ewwww!!'
Joey	 That\xc2\x92s right I stepped up! She\xc2\x92s my friend and she needed\nhelp! And if I had too, I\xc2\x92d pee on anyone of you!'
Joey	 Umm, no. No best friend, no. Just a lot of close friends.'
The Interviewer	 So umm, now back to the show. How does it feel to have a huge\ngay fan base?'
Joey	 Really? Me? Wow! I don\xc2\x92t even know any huge gay people!'
Chandler	 It hurts me. It physically hurts me.'
The Interviewer	 Now, off the record, you\xc2\x92re not\xc2\x85'
Joey	 What? Are you referring to my man's bag? At first, I thought it just\nlooked good, but it's practical too. Check it out! It's got compartments for all your\nstuff! Your wallet! Your keys! Your address book!"
Ross	 Your make-up!'
Ross	 Okay. Now-now-now should I climb down your front so we\xc2\x92re face to\nface or-or should I climb down your back so we\xc2\x92re-we\xc2\x92re butt to face.'
Joey	 I think face to face.'
Ross	 I would say that.'
Joey	 Face to face, yeah!'
Ross	 Okay, here I go.'
Joey	 All right. '
Joey	 (grunting) Oh my\xc2\x85 How much do you weigh Ross?!'
Ross	 I prefer not to answer that right now, I\xc2\x92m still carrying a little\nholiday weight.'
Joey	 Y\xc2\x92know, when we talked about face to face, I don\xc2\x92t think we\nthought it all the way through.'
Joey	 Hey Pheebs! (He sits down next to her.)'
Phoebe	 Hey!'
Joey	 Check it out. (He turns around, pulls down his pants, and shows Phoebe\nthat he\xc2\x92s got panties on.) How much of a man am I?!'
Phoebe	 Wow! Nice! Manly and also kind of a slut.'
Chandler	 You\xc2\x92re turning into a woman.'
Joey	 No I\xc2\x92m not. Why would you say that? That\xc2\x92s just mean.'
Chandler	 Now I\xc2\x92ve upset you? What did I say?'
Joey	 It\xc2\x92s not what you said. It\xc2\x92s the way you said it\xc2\x85 Oh My\nGod, I\xc2\x92m a woman!!!'
Joey	 Great nap.'
Ross	 It really was.'
Joey	 Uh me? Gay? No! No. No, but I have a number of close friends who are.\n(Chandler and Ross look at each other.)'
The Interviewer	 So, let\xc2\x92s talk about women. I\xc2\x92m sure our female\nreaders will be interested to know about your romantic life.'
Joey	 Oh-oh-oh-oh, how I do it is, I look a woman up and down and say,\n"Hey, how you doin\xc2\x92?"'
Phoebe	 Oh, please!'
Joey	 (to Phoebe) Hey, how you doin\xc2\x92?'
Joey	 Hey! How you doin\xc2\x92?'
Woman	 (to her friend) He has the most amazing Porsche under there!'
Joey	 I\xc2\x92d love to show ya, but I just tucked her in. She\xc2\x92s sleeping.\n(The women both laugh) Hey uh, would you two girls like to go for a drink? (Just then the\nsame guy with the football dives to make a catch, lands on the car cover, and collapses\nit. It turns out that Joey set up a bunch of boxes to make it look like a Porsche.)'
Woman	 Hi, is Rachel here? I\xc2\x92m her sister.'
Rachel	 Oh my God, Jill!'
Jill	 Oh my God, Rachel!'
Chandler	 Oh my God, introduce us!'
Rachel	 This is Chandler. (Points at him.)'
Jill	 Hi!'
Rachel	 And you know Monica and Ross!'
Ross	 Hi Jill.'
Rachel	 And that\xc2\x92s Phoebe (points), and that\xc2\x92s Joey.'
Joey	 Hey, (in the Joey voice) how you doin\xc2\x92?'
Rachel	 Don\xc2\x92t!! (Joey backs away frightened.)'
Janine	 No! I mean you're a really nice guy and I'm happy to be your roommate\nand your friend, I'm just y'know, I just don't feel that way about you."
Joey	 Oh! I see what happened. It's because I was trying to repel you. Right?\nBelieve me, you'd feel a lot different if I turned it on."
Janine	 I don't think so."
Joey	 Oh, I do. (Gives her the Joey-love look.) How you doin?'
Janine	 I'm okay."
Joey	 What?!?! Oh dear God!'
Joey	 Not much to tell there I\xc2\x92m really shy.'
The Interviewer	 So, that\xc2\x92s it. I guess that\xc2\x92s all I need. Thank you\nso much. I think they will be running this in the beginning of next month.'
Joey	 Oh great! Great! Thank you. (They shake hands.)'
The Interviewer	 Bye.'
Joey	 Bye-bye. (The interviewer leaves and he sits down with the rest of the\ngang.) I did it!'
Rachel	 Yeah!'
Ross	 Amazing! Amazing!'
The Interviewer	 (returning) Oh wait! I almost forgot. We have to ask everybody\nthis. Other than Days of Our Lives, what\xc2\x92s your favorite soap opera?'
Joey	 Oh, I don\xc2\x92t watch soap operas. Excuse me, I have a life, y\xc2\x92know?'
The Interviewer	 Thank you. The readers at Soap Opera Digest will be\nhappy to hear that.'
Joey	 Oh, good to know. (The interviewer leaves.) So close!'

Rachel	 Wow! I can\xc2\x92t believe they didn\xc2\x92t put it in the part where you\nsaid you didn\xc2\x92t watch soap operas.'
Joey	 Yeah, I called the lady about that. I told her I was just joking. She was\npretty nice about that.'
Monica	 You slept with her didn\xc2\x92t you?'
Joey	 Little bit, yeah.'
Ross	 Wow! This picture of you sure is steamy.'
Joey	 Oh yeah, that\xc2\x92s just a little something for my huge gay fan base.\n(Winks at him.)'
Ross	 Did you just wink at me?'
Joey	 Hey, you\xc2\x92re the one that loves the picture.'
