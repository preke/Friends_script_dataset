[Scene	 Chandler's Office, Chandler is on a coffee break. \xc2\xa0\nShelley enters.)\n\nShelley
Chandler	 Dehydrated Japanese noodles under fluorescent lights... does it get\nbetter than this?'
Shelley	 Question. You're not dating anybody, are you, because I met somebody\nwho would be perfect for you."
Chandler	 Ah, y'see, perfect might be a problem. Had you said 'co-dependent', or\n'self-destructive'..."
Shelley	 Do you want a date Saturday?'
Chandler	 Yes please.'
Shelley	 Okay. He's cute, he's funny, he's-"
Chandler	 He's a he?"
Shelley	 Well yeah! ...Oh God. I- just- I thought- Good, Shelley. I'm just gonna\ngo flush myself down the toilet now...(backs out of the room) Okay, goodbye..."

Chandler	 ...Couldn't enjoy a cup of noodles after that. I mean, is that\nridiculous? Can you believe she actually thought that?"
Rachel	 Um... yeah. Well, I mean, when I first met you, y'know, I thought maybe,\npossibly, you might be... "
Chandler	 You did?'
Rachel	 Yeah, but then you spent Phoebe's entire birthday party talking to my\nbreasts, so then I figured maybe not."
Chandler	 Huh. Did, uh... any of the rest of you guys think that when you first\nmet me?'
Monica	 I did.'
Phoebe	 Yeah, I think so, yeah.'
Joey	 Not me.'
Ross	 Nono, me neither. Although, uh, y'know, back in college, Susan Sallidor\ndid."
Chandler	 You're kidding! Did you tell her I wasn't?"
Ross	 No. No, it's just 'cause, uh, I kinda wanted to go out with her too, so I\ntold her, actually, you were seeing Bernie Spellman... who also liked her, so..."
Chandler	 Well, this is fascinating. So, uh, what is it about me?'
Phoebe	 I dunno, 'cause you're smart, you're funny..."
Chandler	 Ross is smart and funny, d'you ever think that about him?"
All	 Yeah! Right!'
Chandler	 WHAT IS IT?!'
Monica	 Okay, I-I d'know, you-you just- you have a quality."
All	 Yes. Absolutely. A quality.'
Chandler	 Oh, oh, a quality, good, because I was worried you guys were gonna be\nvague about this.'
Monica	 Hello? Hello? Oh! Rachel, it's Paolo calling from Rome. "
Rachel	 Oh my God! Calling from Rome! (Takes phone) Bon giorno, caro mio.\n'
Ross	 (to Joey) So he's calling from Rome. I could do that. Just gotta go to\nRome."
Rachel	 Monica, your dad just beeped in, but can you make it quick? Talking to\nRome. (Showing off to Phoebe and Chandler) I'm talking to Rome."
Monica	 Hey dad, what's up? (Listens) Oh God. Ross, it's Nana."
Ross	 So, uh, how's she doing?"
Aunt Lillian	 The doctor says it's a matter of hours."
Monica	 How-how are you, Mom?'
Mrs. Geller	 Me? I'm fine, fine. I'm glad you're here. ...What's with your hair?"
Monica	 What?'
Mrs. Geller	 What's different?"
Monica	 Nothing.'
Mrs. Geller	 Oh, maybe that's it."
Monica	 She is unbelievable, our mother is...'
Ross	 Okay, relax, relax. We are gonna be here for a while, it looks like, and\nwe still have boyfriends and your career to cover.'
Monica	 Oh God!'
Monica	 The fuzzy little mints at the bottom of her purse. '
Ross	 Oh! ...Yeah, they were gross. Oh, you know what I loved? Her Sweet 'n'\nLos. How she was always stealing them from- from restaurants."
Mr. Geller	 Not just restaurants, from our house.'
Nurse	 Mrs. Geller?'
Ross	 She looks so small. '
Monica	 I know.'
Ross	 Well, at least she's with Pop-Pop and Aunt Phyllis now. "
Monica	 G'bye, Nana. (She kisses her on the forehead.)"
Ross	 Bye, Nana. '
Monica	 Ross!'
Mrs. Geller	 What is going on?!'
Ross	 Y'know how-how the nurse said that-that Nana had passed? Well, she's not,\nquite.."
Mrs. Geller	 What?'
Ross	 She's not- past, she's present, she's back."
Aunt Lillian	 (reentering) What's going on?"
Mr. Geller	 She may have died.'
Aunt Lillian	 She may have died?'
Mr. Geller	 We're looking into it."
Ross	 I, uh, I'll go see. (He goes in)"
Nurse	 This almost never happens!'
Ross	 Now she's passed."
Chandler	 I just have to know, okay. Is it my hair?'
Rachel	 (exasperated) Yes, Chandler, that's exactly what it is. It's your hair."
Phoebe	 Yeah, you have homosexual hair.'
Rachel	 So, um, did she...'
Ross	 Twice.'
Joey	 Twice?'
Phoebe	 Oh, that sucks!'
Joey	 You guys okay?'
Ross	 I dunno, it's weird. I mean, I know she's gone, but I just don't feel,\nuh..."
Phoebe	 Maybe that's 'cause she's not really gone."
Ross	 Nono, she's gone."
Monica	 We checked. A lot.'
Phoebe	 Hm, I mean maybe no-one ever really goes. Ever since my mom died, every\nnow and then, I get the feeling that she's like right here, y'know? (She circles her hand\naround her right shoulder. Chandler, sitting on her right, draws back nervously) Oh! And\nDebbie, my best friend from junior high- got struck by lightning on a miniature golf\ncourse- I always get this really strong Debbie vibe whenever I use one of those little\nyellow pencils, y'know? ...I miss her."
Rachel	 Aw. Hey, Pheebs, want this? (Gives her a pencil)'
Phoebe	 Thanks!'
Rachel	 Sure. I just sharpened her this morning.'
Joey	 Now, see, I don't believe any of that. I think once you're dead, you're\ndead! You're gone! You're worm food! (realises his tactlessness) ...So Chandler looks gay,\nhuh?"
Phoebe	 Y'know, I dunno who this is, but it's not Debbie. (Hands back the\npencil)"
Ross	 I thought it was gonna be a closed casket.'
Mrs. Geller	 Well, that doesn't mean she can't look nice!"
Mrs. Geller	 Sweetie, you think you can get in there?'
Ross	 (sarcastic) I don't see why not."
Ross	 Here's my retainer!"
Mr. Geller	 I was just thinking. When my time comes-'
Monica	 Dad!'
Mr. Geller	 Listen to me! When my time comes, I wanna be buried at sea.'
Monica	 You what?'
Mr. Geller	 I wanna be buried at sea, it looks like fun. '
Monica	 Define fun.'
Mr. Geller	 C'mon, you'll make a day of it! You'll rent a boat, pack a lunch..."
Monica	 ...And then we throw your body in the water... Gee, that does sound fun.'
Mr. Geller	 Everyone thinks they know me. Everyone says 'Jack Geller, so\npredictable'. Maybe after I'm gone, they'll say 'Buried at sea! Huh!'."
Monica	 That's probably what they'll say."
Mr. Geller	 I'd like that."
Chandler	 Hey, gorgeous.'
Shelley	 (sheepish) Hey. Look, I'm sorry about yesterday, I, um-"
Chandler	 No, nono, don't- don't worry about it. Believe me, apparently other\npeople have made the same mistake."
Shelley	 Oh! Okay! Phew! '
Chandler	 So, uh... what do you think it is about me?'
Shelley	 I dunno, uh... you just have a-a...'
Chandler	 ...Quality, right, great.'
Shelley	 Y'know, it's a shame, because you and Lowell would've made a great\ncouple."
Chandler	 Lowell? Financial Services' Lowell, that's who you saw me with?"
Shelley	 What? He's cute!"
Chandler	 Well, yeah... 's'no Brian in Payroll."
Shelley	 Is Brian...?'
Chandler	 No! Uh, I d'know! The point is, if you were gonna set me up with\nsomeone, I'd like to think you'd set me up with someone like him."
Shelley	 Well, I think Brian's a little out of your league."
Chandler	 Excuse me? You don't think I could get a Brian? Because I could get\na Brian. Believe you me. ...I'm really not."
Ross	 (holding a dress out from inside the closet) This one?'
Aunt Lillian	 No.'
Ross	 I have shown you everything we have. Unless you want your mother to spend\neternity in a lemon yellow pant-suit, go with the burgundy.'
Aunt Lillian	 You know, whatever we pick, she would've told us it's the wrong\none."
Mrs. Geller	 You're right. We'll go with the burgundy."
Ross	 Oh! A fine choice. I'm coming out. (Starts to climb over the furniture)"
Aunt Lillian	 Wait! We need shoes!'
Ross	 Okay. Um, how about these? (Holds out a pair)'
Mrs. Geller	 That's really a day shoe."
Ross	 And where she's going everyone else'll be dressier?"
Aunt Lillian	 Could we see something in a slimmer heel?'
Ross	 (forages around) Okay, I have nothing in an evening shoe in the burgundy.\nI can show you something in a silver that may work.'
Aunt Lillian	 No, it really should be burgundy.'
Mrs. Geller	 Mm. Unless we go with a different dress?'
Ross	 No! Nonono, wait a sec. I may have something in the back.'
Ross	 Oh my God..'
Mrs. Geller	 Is everything all right, dear?'
Ross	 Yeah, just... just Nana stuff.'

Ross	 (entering) How we doing, you guys ready?'
Monica	 Mom already called this morning to remind me not to wear my hair up. Did\nyou know my ears are not my best feature?'
Ross	 Some days it's all I can think about. "
Phoebe	 (entering) Hi, sorry I'm late, I couldn't find my bearings."
Rachel	 Oh, you-you mean your earrings?'
Phoebe	 What'd I say?"
Rachel	 (sticking her foot out) Hm-m.'
Monica	 Are these the shoes?'
Rachel	 Yes. Paolo sent them from Italy.'
Ross	 What, we-uh- we don't have shoes here, or...?"
Joey	 (entering with Chandler) Morning. We ready to go?'
Chandler	 Well, don't we look nice all dressed up?...It's stuff like that, isn't\nit?"
Monica	 It was a really beautiful service.'
Mrs. Geller	 It really was. Oh, c'mere, sweetheart. (Hugs her) Y'know, I think\nit might be time for you to start using night cream."
Joey	 What?'
Chandler	 Nothing, just your overcoat sounds remarkably like Brent Mussberger.'
Joey	 Check it out, Giants-Cowboys. (He has a pocket TV)'
Chandler	 You're watching a football game at a funeral?"
Joey	 No, it's the pre-game. I'm gonna watch it at the reception."
Chandler	 You are a frightening, frightening man.'
Rachel	 Oh no! My new Paolo shoes!'
Ross	 Oh, I hope they're not ruined."
Phoebe	 God, what a great day. ...What? Weather-wise!'
Ross	 I know, uh, the air, the-the trees... even though Nana's gone there's,\nthere's something almost, uh- I dunno, almost life-aff- (Not looking where he is going he\nfalls into an open grave)"
All	 God! Ross!'
Ross	 I'm fine. Just-just... having my worst fear realised..."
Phoebe	 Okay, don't worry, I'm just checking to see if the muscle's in\nspasm...huh."
Ross	 What, what is it?'
Phoebe	 You missed a belt loop. '
Ross	 Oh! No-n-'
Phoebe	 Okay, it's in spasm."
Mrs. Geller	 Here, sweetie, here. I took these when I had my golfing accident.\n(Hands Ross a bottle of pills. Then turns to Monica and pats her hair over her ears)'
Chandler	 Oh, no-'
Andrea	 Sorry- Hi, I'm Dorothy's daughter."
Chandler	 Hi, I'm Chandler, and I have no idea who Dorothy is."
Phoebe	 Hey, look who's up! How do you feel?"
Ross	 I feel great. I feel- great, I fleel great.'
Monica	 Wow, those pills really worked, huh?'
Ross	 Not the first two, but the second two- woooo! ...I love you guys. You guys\nare the greatest. I love my sister (Kisses Monica), I love Pheebs... (Hugs her)'
Phoebe	 Ooh! That's so nice..."
Ross	 ...Chandler! '
Chandler	 Hey.'
Ross	 (hugs him) And listen, man, if you wanna be gay, be gay. Doesn't matter to\nme."
Andrea	 (turns to a friend) You were right. (They walk off and leave Chandler.)'
Ross	 Rachel. Rachel Rachel. (Sits down beside her) I love you the most.'
Rachel	 (humouring him) Oh, well you know who I love the most?'
Ross	 No.'
Rachel	 You!'
Ross	 Oh.. you don't get it! (Passes out and slumps across her)"
Mr. Geller	 Whaddya got there?'
Joey	 (hides the TV, but he still has an earphone) Just a, uh... hearing\ndisability.'
Mr. Geller	 What's the score?"
Joey	 Seventeen-fourteen Giants... three minutes to go in the third.'
Mr. Geller	 Beautiful! (Turns to watch with him)'
Rachel	 (still trapped under Ross) Pheebs, could you maybe hand me a cracker?'
Mrs. Geller	 (to Monica) Your grandmother would have hated this.'
Monica	 Well, sure, what with it being her funeral and all.'
Mrs. Geller	 No, I'd be hearing about 'Why didn't I get the honey-glazed ham?',\nI didn't spend enough on flowers, and if I spent more she'd be saying 'Why are you wasting\nyour money? I don't need flowers, I'm dead'."
Monica	 That sounds like Nana.'
Mrs. Geller	 Do you know what it's like to grow up with someone who is critical\nof every single thing you say?"
Monica	 ...I can imagine.'
Mrs. Geller	 I'm telling you, it's a wonder your mother turned out to be the\npositive, life-affirming person that she is."
Monica	 That is a wonder. So tell me something, Mom. If you had to do it all\nover again, I mean, if she was here right now, would you tell her?'
Mrs. Geller	 Tell her what?'
Monica	 How she drove you crazy, picking on every little detail, like your\nhair... for example.'
Mrs. Geller	 I'm not sure I know what you're getting at."
Monica	 Do you think things would have been better if you'd just told her the\ntruth?"
Mrs. Geller	 ...No. I think some things are better left unsaid. I think it's\nnicer when people just get along. "
Monica	 Huh.'
Mrs. Geller	 More wine, dear?'
Monica	 Oh, I think so.'
Mrs. Geller	 (reaches out to fiddle with Monica's hair again, and realises)\nThose earrings look really lovely on you."
Monica	 Thank you. They're yours."
Mrs. Geller	 Actually they were Nana's."
Mr. Geller	 Now I'm depressed! ...(To everyone) Even more than I was."
Rachel	 Hey, who's this little naked guy?"
Ross	 That little naked guy would be me.'
Rachel	 Aww, look at the little thing.'
Ross	 Yes, yes, fine, that is my penis. Can we be grown-ups now?'
Chandler	 Who are those people?'
Ross	 Got me.'
Monica	 Oh, that's Nana, right there in the middle. (Reads the back) 'Me and the\ngang at Java Joe's'. "
Rachel	 Wow, Monica, you look just like your grandmother. How old was she there?'
Monica	 Let's see, 1939... yeah, 24, 25?"
Ross	 Looks like a fun gang. (They all look at each other and smile)'
Joey	 Ooh, look-look-look-look-look! I got Monica naked!'
Ross	 (looking) Nono, that would be me again. I'm, uh, just trying something."

Chandler	 Hey, Lowell.'
Lowell	 Hey, Chandler.'
Chandler	 So how's it going there in Financial Services?"
Lowell	 It's like Mardi Gras without the paper mache heads. How 'bout you?"
Chandler	 Good, good. Listen, heh, I dunno what Shelley told you about me, but,\nuh... I'm not."
Lowell	 I know. That's what I told her."
Chandler	 Really.'
Lowell	 Yeah.'
Chandler	 So- you can tell?'
Lowell	 Pretty much, most of the time. We have a kind of... radar.'
Chandler	 So you don't think I have a, a quality?"
Lowell	 Speaking for my people, I'd have to say no. By the way, your friend\nBrian from Payroll, he is."
Chandler	 He is?'
Lowell	 Yup, and waaay out of your league. (Exits)'
Chandler	 Out of my league. I could get a Brian. (Brian enters behind him) If I\nwanted to get a Brian, I could get a Brian. (Sees him) Hey, Brian.'
