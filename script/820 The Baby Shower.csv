Rachel	 (entering) Hi!'
Monica	 Hey!'
Phoebe	 Hey!'
Rachel	 So what\xc2\x92s the final head count on my baby shower?'
Phoebe	 About twenty, a couple people from work who had something else to do. '
Monica	 Also both of your sisters called and neither can make it.'
Rachel	 What?! You mean they\xc2\x92re not coming to a social event where\nthere\xc2\x92s no men and there\xc2\x92s no booze?! That\xc2\x92s shocking! I don\xc2\x92t care,\nas long as my mom\xc2\x92s here.'
Monica	 Oh my God, your mother!'
Rachel	 What?! My mom\xc2\x92s not gonna be here?!'
Monica	 Well, given that we forgot to invite her it would be an awfully big\ncoincidence if she was.'
Rachel	 My God!'
Monica	 Well it wasn\xc2\x92t my fault, Phoebe was in charge of the invitations!'
Phoebe	 Well I don\xc2\x92t, I don\xc2\x92t have a mother so often I forget that\nother people\xc2\x85'
Monica	 (interrupting her) Oh give it a rest!'
Rachel	 So my mother is not coming to my baby shower?!'
Phoebe	 No. (Pause) Neither is mine.'
Monica	 Okay, y\xc2\x92know what? Don\xc2\x92t worry, okay? We\xc2\x92ll take care of\nit. We\xc2\x92ll call her. Just go home and get ready.'
Rachel	 Please, make sure she comes. It\xc2\x92s really important to me, I mean\nit\xc2\x92s my mom!'
Phoebe	 I know. I know, what\xc2\x92s her number?'
Rachel	 I don\xc2\x92t know.'
Monica	 Go! I have it in my book. Go! (Rachel leaves and Monica calls Mrs.\nGreen.) (To Phoebe) Wait a minute! If you\xc2\x92re in charge of the invitations why am I\nthe one who has to call her\xc2\x97Hello Mrs. Green! Hi, it\xc2\x92s Monica Geller.'
Mrs. Green	 Oh, hello Monica.'
Monica	 (on phone) Hi, umm I know this is last minute, but we\xc2\x92ve decided to\nthrow an impromptu baby shower for Rachel today.'
Mrs. Green	 I know, my daughter\xc2\x92s told me about it when they received their\nimpromptu invitations a month ago.'
Monica	 Yeah, I\xc2\x92m sorry. I\xc2\x92m-I\xc2\x92m so sorry.'
Mrs. Green	 For what dear? For not inviting me or lying about it?'
Monica	 (To Phoebe) Oh my God, my ass is sweating! (on phone) Please! Please!\nCan you come? It\xc2\x92s today at four.'
Mrs. Green	 Well all right. I\xc2\x92ll see you at four.'
Monica	 Thank you. (Hangs up.)'
Phoebe	 Isn\xc2\x92t it at three?'
Monica	 Son of a bitch! (Calls Mrs. Green again.)'

Chandler	 Hey Joe! You wanna shoot some hoops?'
Joey	 Oh no, I can\xc2\x92t go. I\xc2\x92m practicing; I got an audition to be the\nhost of a new game show.'
Ross	 Oh cool!'
Chandler	 That\xc2\x92s great.'
Joey	 Yeah-yeah, and if I get it by day I\xc2\x92ll (In a sexy voice) Dr. Drake\nRemoray, but by night I\xc2\x92ll be (In an announcer\xc2\x92s voice) Joey Trrrribbiani!'
Chandler	 You\xc2\x92ll be perfect for this! That\xc2\x92s already your name!'
Joey	 But the audition\xc2\x92s in a couple hours and I don\xc2\x92t even understand\nthe game.'
Ross	 Well do you want some help?'
Joey	 Oh really? That\xc2\x92d be great! You guys can be the contestants!'
Ross	 Awesome!'
Chandler	 Okay, I guess we can lose to junior high girls some other time.'
Joey	 (announcer voice) All right! Let\xc2\x92s play Bamboozled!'
Chandler	 Bamboozled?'
Joey	 Yeah, isn\xc2\x92t that a cool name?'
Ross	 (simultaneously with Chandler) Yeah!'
Chandler	 (simultaneously with Ross) No!'
Joey	 All right. Uhh, okay. Our first contestant is Ross Geller. Why don\xc2\x92t\nyou tell us a little something about you Ross?'
Ross	 Well uh, I-I\xc2\x92m a paleontologist. Umm, I-I live in New York. I have a\nson Ben. Uh, hi Ben! (Waves.) And uh\xc2\x85'
Joey	 I said a little bit Ross. Now, how about you Chandler?'
Chandler	 Well Joey, I\xc2\x92m a headhunter. I hook up out of work Soviet\nscientists with rogue third-world nations. Hi Rasputin! (Waves.)'
Joey	 Excellent! Let\xc2\x92s play Bamboozled! Chandler, you\xc2\x92ll go first.\nWhat is the capital of Columbia?'
Chandler	 Bogota.'
Joey	 It\xc2\x92s Ba-go-ta, but close enough. Now, you can either pass your turn\nto Ross or pick a Wicked Wango card.'
Chandler	 What does a Wicked Wango card do?'
Joey	 I should know that. Let\xc2\x92s see, just one moment please. Umm, here we\nare, a Wicked Wango card determines whether you go higher or lower.'
Chandler	 Higher or lower than what?'
Joey	 This is embarrassing. (Looks it up.)'
Chandler	 (To Ross) Can you believe how lame this is?'
Ross	 I\xc2\x92m sorry, I don\xc2\x92t believe contestants are allowed to talk to\neach other.'
Phoebe	 Oh, I told the stripper to be here at five. That\xc2\x92s good right?'
Monica	 You ordered a stripper for the shower?! That is totally inappropriate!'
Phoebe	 What? He\xc2\x92s gonna be dressed as a baby! (Mrs. Green enters.) Oh hi\nMrs. Green!'
Monica	 Hi!'
Phoebe	 I\xc2\x92m so glad you could make it.'
Monica	 Yes, thank you so much. And again, we\xc2\x92re so sorry. We could not\nfeel worse about it.'
Mrs. Green	 Try. There\xc2\x92s my little girl. (Goes over to Rachel.)'
Monica	 She\xc2\x92s still mad.'
Phoebe	 Yeah I know. Isn\xc2\x92t it great? One less person we have to make small\ntalk with.'
Monica	 Phoebe, Sandra\xc2\x92s mad at you too. It-it doesn\xc2\x92t bother you?'
Phoebe	 No look, we\xc2\x92ve apologized twice! I can\xc2\x92t do anymore than that.\nI know you hate it when people are mad at you but you just have to be okay with it.'
Monica	 Okay. I can do that. (Pause) I gotta go powder my ass.'
Mrs. Green	 Look at that face! Just like when you were in high school! If I\ndidn\xc2\x92t know better I\xc2\x92d say you were a cheerleader in trouble. Come on,\nlet\xc2\x92s get some tea.'
Rachel	 Okay. (Mrs. Green helps her up and they walk over and get some tea.)'
Mrs. Green	 Oh my look at that. Only three weeks to go, now have you picked your\nnanny yet? Now I don\xc2\x92t want you to use your housekeeper \xc2\x91cause it would just\nsplit her focus.'
Rachel	 Oh well actually gonna use a nanny and uh, I don\xc2\x92t even have a\nhousekeeper.'
Mrs. Green	 It\xc2\x92s like you\xc2\x92re a cave person. Rachel, you must get a\nnanny. You don\xc2\x92t know how overwhelming this is going to be. I mean when you were a\nbaby I had full time help, I had Mrs. Kay.'
Rachel	 Mrs. Kay! Oh yeah, she was sweet. She taught me Spanish. I actually\nthink I remember some of it, tu madre es loca. (I think that\xc2\x92s your mother\xc2\x92s\ncrazy.)'
Mrs. Green	 Such a sweet woman.'
Rachel	 Well, however great she was I just can\xc2\x92t afford that.'
Mrs. Green	 Oh Rachel!'
Rachel	 What?'
Mrs. Green	 I just had the greatest idea! I\xc2\x92m gonna come live with you!'
Rachel	 Wh-wh-what? What?'
Mrs. Green	 Oh, I\xc2\x92m so happy I\xc2\x92m gonna do this for my little girl. Aw,\nlook at you. You have tears in your eyes.'
Rachel	 Yes. Yes I do.'
Joey	 All right Ross you\xc2\x92re in the lead, would you like to take another\nquestion or spin the Wheel of Mayhem?'
Ross	 The wheel has not been my friend tonight Joey. Uh, I\xc2\x92ll take another\nquestion. '
Joey	 Okay, this is gonna be tough. Hold your breath.'
Ross	 It\xc2\x92s okay, I\xc2\x92m ready.'
Joey	 No dude, you gotta hold your breath until you\xc2\x92re ready to answer the\nquestion.'
Chandler	 This is ridiculous, he\xc2\x92s not gonna hold his breath\xc2\x85 (Ross\ncuts him off by taking a deep breath and holding it.)'
Joey	 Okay, what do you have a fear of if you suffer from this phobia,\nTris\xc2\x85Holy cow, that\xc2\x92s a big word. Trisc\xc2\x85 Seriously look at this thing.\nChandler, how do you say that?'
Chandler	 Let me see that.'
Joey	 This one right here. (Ross whines.)'
Chandler	 Triscadecaphobia.'
Ross	 (exhaling) The fear of Triscuts! '
Joey	 No! No, fear of the number 13.'
Chandler	 Fear of Triscuts?'
Ross	 It\xc2\x92s possible, they have really sharp edges.'
Joey	 All right Chandler, you\xc2\x92re up.'
Ross	 Wait a minute, I-I believe I\xc2\x92m entitled to use my Angel Pass for a\nfree turn?'
Chandler	 This game makes no sense!'
Ross	 Y\xc2\x92know what? You\xc2\x92re just upset because you\xc2\x92re losing.'
Chandler	 Oh come on Ross, I think we\xc2\x92re all losers here.'
Joey	 All right. Chandler, you can either spin the wheel or pick a Google card.'
Chandler	 Let me think. Let me think\xc2\x97Oh! I don\xc2\x92t care.'
Joey	 You-you must choose Mr. Bing.'
Chandler	 Either, it makes no difference.'
Joey	 Choose, you jackass!'
Chandler	 I\xc2\x92ll take a card.'
Joey	 Okay, you picked the Gimmie card! You get all of Ross\xc2\x92s points!'
Ross	 What?!'
Chandler	 This game is kinda fun.'
Ross	 (To Chandler) You don\xc2\x92t think it\xc2\x92s a little crazy that you get\nall my points just \xc2\x91cause you\xc2\x85'
Chandler	 I don\xc2\x92t think the contestants are supposed to speak to each\nother.'
Rachel	 Why did you invite my mother?!'
Monica	 What?'
Rachel	 She wants to move in with me and Ross to help take care of the baby.'
Phoebe	 For how long?'
Rachel	 Eight weeks. I mean I love my mother, but my God, a long lunch with her\nis taxing.'
Monica	 I personally would be honored if she wanted to live with me.'
Phoebe	 She can\xc2\x92t hear you.'
Rachel	 What? You guys, come on! What am I going to do?'
Phoebe	 Well, if you don\xc2\x92t want your mother to move in with you, just tell\nher.'
Rachel	 You\xc2\x92re right. You\xc2\x92re right. I mean I\xc2\x92m about to have a\nbaby, I can tell my mother that I don\xc2\x92t want her to just be sleeping on my couch! Oh\nmy God! She\xc2\x92s gonna want to sleep in my bed with me. This cannot happen!'
Monica	 That\xc2\x92s right. That is right, you go over there and tell her you\ndon\xc2\x92t want her to live with you. Do not take no for an answer!'
Rachel	 Okay. (She goes over to tell her mother.)'
Monica	 (To Phoebe) This is great! Now she\xc2\x92s gonna be mad at Rachel!\nY\xc2\x92know what? And I\xc2\x92m just gonna swoop in there and be like the daughter she\nnever had.'
Phoebe	 I have new respect for Chandler. All right everybody! It\xc2\x92s time to\nopen the presents!'
Monica	 Yes! Yes! And I think that the first gift that Rachel opens\nshould be from the grandmother of the baby, because you\xc2\x92re the most important person\nin this room. And in the world!'
Mrs. Green	 Well uh, I don\xc2\x92t have a gift because I wasn\xc2\x92t invited\nuntil the last minute, but thank you so much for bringing that to everyone\xc2\x92s\nattention.'
Phoebe	 How about you less important people, let\xc2\x92s open your presents!'
Rachel	 Mom that\xc2\x92s okay that you didn\xc2\x92t get you a gift!'
Mrs. Green	 Well, I kinda did. Me. Eight weeks of me.'
Rachel	 Oh yeah. Okay, see mom, the truth is I can do this on my own.'
Mrs. Green	 Sweetheart I know you\xc2\x92re gonna be terrific mom, I just think\nyou need a little help, especially at the beginning.'
Rachel	 But mom, I really know what I\xc2\x92m doing. I can handle this.'
Mrs. Green	 Really? Remember Twinkles?'
Rachel	 He was a hamster! I am not going to vacuum up my baby!'
Phoebe	 Okay, come on Rach it\xc2\x92s present time! Y\xc2\x92know you\xc2\x92re the\nglue that\xc2\x92s holding this whole party together. It\xc2\x92s kinda falling apart here.'
Mrs. Green	 Oh look.'
Rachel	 Wow!'
Phoebe	 Okay, this is from your friend at work.'
Rachel	 Oh my gosh! Oh wow! Oh, I know what this is! (She\xc2\x92s holding an item\nwith a large suction cup connected to a yellow plastic box, with a long narrow tube and\nbottle connected the yellow part.) Wait a minute. That can\xc2\x92t be right. Is that a beer\nbong for a baby?'
Mrs. Green	 Darling, that\xc2\x92s a breast pump!'
Rachel	 Did I say I was done guessing? Okay, thank you for that. Oh wow!\nWhat\xc2\x92s this?'
Woman	 It\xc2\x92s a diaper genie.'
Rachel	 Oh, it dispenses clean diapers!'
Woman	 No! It\xc2\x92s where you put the dirty ones!'
Rachel	 Well that\xc2\x92s gross, why don\xc2\x92t you just take it outside and\nthrow it in a dumpster?'
Mrs. Green	 Oh you\xc2\x92re gonna do that ten times a day?'
Rachel	 What?! It goes ten times a day! What are we feeding this baby?! Indian\nfood?!'
Mrs. Green	 No dear, that\xc2\x92s what babies do.'
Monica	 Rachel, listen to your mother. She is very smart.'
Mrs. Green	 Plus, what are you planning on doing with the baby while you\xc2\x92re\ntrotting out to the garbage ten times a day?'
Rachel	 I don\xc2\x92t know, I\xc2\x92d leave it on the changing table? (Everyone\ngasps.) What?! What\xc2\x92d I do? What\xc2\x92d I do?!'
Mrs. Green	 You can\xc2\x92t leave a baby alone!'
Rachel	 Oh come\xc2\x97(Stutters)\xc2\x97Of course I know that. I mean of course you\nnever leave a baby alone! I mean who would\xc2\x97she wouldn\xc2\x92t be safe as she would be\nwith me, the baby dummy. Oh God, okay. Y\xc2\x92know what? I think opening the presents\nright now is a little overwhelming right now. So I think umm, I\xc2\x92m just gonna maybe\nopen them a little bit later, but thank you all for coming. And for these beautiful gifts,\nand this basket is beautiful.'
Woman	 It\xc2\x92s actually a bassinet. '
Rachel	 Okay mommy, don\xc2\x92t ever leave me. (Hugs her.)'

Joey	 (To Chandler) In what John Houston film would you hear this line,\n"Badges? We don\xc2\x92t need no stinkin\xc2\x92 badges!"'
Chandler	 Treasure of the Sierra Madre!'
Joey	 Correct! There\xc2\x92s a possible backwards bonus!'
Chandler	 Madre Sierra the of Treasure!'
Joey	 Yes!'
Chandler	 I\xc2\x92d like to go up the ladder of chance to the golden mud hut\nplease.'
Joey	 Wise choice, how many rungs?'
Chandler	 Six!'
Joey	 (makes a sound like a monkey) That noise can only me one thing.'
Chandler	 (disappointed and simultaneously as Ross) Hungry monkey.'
Ross	 (excited and simultaneously as Chandler) Hungry monkey! (To Chandler)\nHaaa! (To Joey) I\xc2\x92d like a Wicked Wango card!'
Joey	 Okay, it\xc2\x92s an audio question, name this television theme song.\n(Starts humming the theme to I Dream of Genie.)'
Ross	 (thinking) Oh. (Pause) Oh! Oh my God! Okay, I know this, give me-give me a\nsecond!'
Chandler	 Tell it to the Time Turtle!'
Ross	 Shut up! I Dream of Genie!'
Joey	 Yes! Yes, you\xc2\x92re back in the lead!'
Ross	 I\xc2\x92d like to spin the wheel!'
Chandler	 (annoyed) Oh come on!!'
Joey	 All right! All right! Uh, umm, Super-Speedy Speed round!'
Ross	 Is there a hopping bonus?'
Joey	 Of course!'
Joey	 Who invented bifocals? '
Ross	 Ben Franklin.'
Joey	 Correct! Which monarch has ruled Great Britain the longest?'
Ross	 Queen Victoria.'
Joey	 Correct again! But, you forgot to switch legs between questions, so no\nhopping bonus!'
Ross	 Noooo!!! Every time!!!'
Joey	 Now, over to Chandler.'
Chandler	 I\xc2\x92d like a Google Card.'
Joey	 Are you sure?'
Chandler	 Yes! (Pause) No! (Pause) Google!'
Joey	 Oh my God! Congratulations Ross, because Chandler, you\xc2\x92ve been\nBamboozled!'
Chandler	 Nooo!!'
Ross	 Yeah!!'
Chandler	 This is the best game ever!!!'
Rachel	 So umm, you\xc2\x92re gonna stay with me as long as I need you?'
Mrs. Green	 Of course I am!'
Rachel	 Oh mom, I swear I\xc2\x92m not an idiot. I\xc2\x92ve read all kinds of books\non pregnancy and giving birth, but I-I just didn\xc2\x92t think to read the part about what\nto do when the baby comes. And-and then guess what? The baby\xc2\x92s coming and I\ndon\xc2\x92t know what to do. Oh, can I throw up in my diaper genie?'
Mrs. Green	 No. Sweetie, you\xc2\x92re gonna be fine. (Starts to get up.)'
Rachel	 Wait-wait where are you going? Where are you going?'
Mrs. Green	 I\xc2\x92m going to the bathroom.'
Rachel	 Okay.'
Mrs. Green	 Now don\xc2\x92t worry! Everything\xc2\x92s gonna be okay. (Hugs Rachel\nwhile she is standing and Rachel is sitting, seeing this Monica decides to join in on the\nhugging by hugging Mrs. Green from behind her back.)'
Monica	 It is going to be okay! (Mrs. Green glances over her shoulder and\nglares at Monica while she heads for the bathroom.) It was worth a shot.'
Ross	 (entering, out of breath) Hey!'
Phoebe	 Hey! Why are you all red and sweaty?'
Ross	 I just Bamboozled Chandler! (Flexes in victory while everyone stares at\nhim.) Which is not uh sexual thing. That was a quick shower.'
Phoebe	 Not if you were here.'
Ross	 Wow! It looks like we got a lot of good stuff.'
Rachel	 Oh we did, but my mom got us the greatest gift of all.'
Ross	 (excited) A Play-Dough Barber Shop?'
Rachel	 No. She\xc2\x92s going to live with us for eight weeks.'
Ross	 Uh, what?'
Rachel	 Yes! She\xc2\x92s gonna help us take care of the baby! Woo-hoo. (Sees that\nRoss isn\xc2\x92t happy.)'
Ross	 What\xc2\x97You\xc2\x92re not serious. I mean she\xc2\x92s a very nice woman,\nbut there is no way we can take eight weeks of her. She\xc2\x92ll drive us totally crazy.'
Mrs. Green	 (entering from bathroom) Hi Ross!'
Ross	 Hi roomie! (Hugs her and looks at Rachel.)'
Man	 Hey Joey, hi! I\xc2\x92m Ray; I\xc2\x92m the producer of the show.'
Joey	 (announcer voice) It\xc2\x92s a pleasure to meet you Ray.'
Ray	 And this is Duncan (points to the cameraman) and Erin, they\xc2\x92re gonna\nhelp us out with the audition. So uh, let\xc2\x92s get the camera rolling.'
Joey	 (announcer voice) Rightie-O Ray!'
Ray	 Whenever you\xc2\x92re ready.'
Joey	 (to the camera) Hello, I\xc2\x92m Joey Tribbiani! Let\xc2\x92s play\nBamboozled! Erin, you get the first question! In hockey, who is known as The Great One?'
Erin	 Wayne Gretzky.'
Joey	 Correct! Now, would you like to pick a Wicked Wango card or spin the Wheel\nof Mayhem?'
Ray	 Uh Joey, didn\xc2\x92t your agents give you the revised rules? We\xc2\x92ve\neliminated all of that. No wheel, no cards.'
Joey	 What\xc2\x97Why?!'
Ray	 Uh well, the game was too complicated and research showed people\ndidn\xc2\x92t follow it.'
Joey	 Well what\xc2\x92s complicated? You spin the Wheel of Mayhem to go up the\nLadder of Chance. You go past the Mud Hut through the Rainbow Ring to get to the Golden\nMonkey; you yank his tail and boom! You\xc2\x92re in Paradise Pond!'
Ray	 Yeah all that\xc2\x92s gone. It\xc2\x92s basically just a simple question and\nanswer game now.'
Joey	 Well what\xc2\x92s fun about that? You expect me to be the host of a boring\ngame that\xc2\x92s just people standing around answering questions?'
Ray	 Well, there\xc2\x92ll be women in bikinis holding up the scores.'
Joey	 (announcer voice to the camera) Let\xc2\x92s play Bamboozled!'
Mrs. Green	 \xc2\x85and all those dinosaur nick-knacks you have Ross, I thought\nthey might be more at home in the garage.'
Ross	 Well we\xc2\x85we don\xc2\x92t have a garage.'
Mrs. Green	 Did I say garage? I meant garbage.'
Ross	 Y\xc2\x92know what? Maybe, Mrs. Green, it\xc2\x92s not absolutely vital that\nyou live with us.'
Mrs. Green	 Well Rachel needs help with the baby.'
Rachel	 I do. I really do. I don\xc2\x92t know anything.'
Ross	 I\xc2\x92m-I\xc2\x92m sure that\xc2\x92s not true.'
Rachel	 Oh no? Pheebs? Monica? Do I know anything about babies?'
Phoebe	 No, not a thing.'
Monica	 It\xc2\x92s frightening.'
Ross	 Well uh, y\xc2\x92know what? Even if she doesn\xc2\x92t know anything, I do! I\nhave a son. And his mother and I didn\xc2\x92t live together, and whenever he was with me I\ntook care of him all the time, by myself.'
Mrs. Green	 That\xc2\x92s true. You do have another child.'
Ross	 Yeah.'
Mrs. Green	 With another woman. Have you no control Ross?'
Ross	 That\xc2\x92s a different issue. Uh, the point is, when the baby comes I\nwill be there to\xc2\x85to feed her and bathe her and change her. And more than that I want\nto do all those things.'
Mrs. Green	 Well then you really don\xc2\x92t need me to live with you.'
Ross	 Yes! Yes, you\xc2\x92re gonna be so missed.'
Mrs. Green	 You\xc2\x92re gonna be a great father.'
Ross	 Well you\xc2\x92re gonna be a wonderful grandma. (They hug.)'
Rachel	 Hello?! I still don\xc2\x92t know what the hell I\xc2\x92m doing!'
Ross	 Oh, come on, every first time mother feels that way.\nYou\xc2\x92ll\xc2\x97you\xc2\x92re gonna pick it up. (Rachel doesn\xc2\x92t believe that.) Hey!\nYou will! Uh look, y\xc2\x92know when you first came to the city? You were this spoiled\nhelpless little girl who-who still used daddy\xc2\x92s credit card. Do you remember?'
Rachel	 I hope you\xc2\x92re going somewhere with this.'
Ross	 Look at you! What\xc2\x97You\xc2\x92re-you\xc2\x92re this big executive! You are\nmuch more capable than you give yourself credit for. I-I have no doubt you\xc2\x92re gonna\nbe an incredible mother. '
Rachel	 Really?'
Ross	 I\xc2\x92m telling you.'
Rachel	 Thank you. (Hugs him.)'
Mrs. Green	 All right you two, I\xc2\x92m gonna get going.'
Ross	 Oh. (Rachel and he start to stand up.)'
Mrs. Green	 Oh no-no-no-no sweetheart, you stay put. I\xc2\x92ll let myself out.\nIt\xc2\x92s like I\xc2\x92m not here, which I almost wasn\xc2\x92t.'
Monica	 (laughs) You\xc2\x92re still so funny. You\xc2\x92re so funny. (To Phoebe)\nWhat do I do?'
Phoebe	 Nothing! You have apologized to her like a million times and she\xc2\x92s\nbeen nothing but terrible to you. And don\xc2\x92t forget you just threw her daughter\na lovely, albeit slightly boring, shower, and she hasn\xc2\x92t even thanked you for\nit.'
Monica	 Y\xc2\x92know what? You\xc2\x92re-you\xc2\x92re right.'
Phoebe	 Yeah I mean if you want to say anything to her, I\xc2\x92d tell her off.'
Monica	 Really?'
Phoebe	 Uh-huh!'
Monica	 Okay! I will! Mrs. Green? Mrs. Green! (She ignores Monica and Monica\nfollows her out into the hall with Phoebe in tow.) It is rude to leave a party without\nsaying good-bye to the host! Yeah, and-and also when someone apologizes to you the decent\nthing to do is to accept it! Now what I did to you, it wasn\xc2\x92t on purpose! But what\nyou\xc2\x92re during to me now is just plain spiteful!'
Mrs. Green	 Spiteful?!'
Monica	 That\xc2\x92s right! Maybe it\xc2\x92s time you took a good hard look at a\nmirror young lady\xc2\x85old lady\xc2\x85lady!'
Phoebe	 (To Monica) Wrap it up, wrap it up, wrap it up\xc2\x85'
Monica	 So whenever you\xc2\x92re ready to apologize to me, I will forgive you.\nGood day! (Monica and Phoebe reenter the apartment and Monica closes the door on a stunned\nMrs. Green.) I can\xc2\x92t feel my legs!'
Phoebe	 You were fantastic! I\xc2\x92m so proud of you!'
Monica	 Yeah? I\xc2\x92m proud of me too.'
Phoebe	 You should be!'
Monica	 Yeah could-could-could you get me something to drink?'
Phoebe	 You got it!'
Monica	 Okay. (When Phoebe turns around Monica runs out into the hall after Mrs.\nGreen.) Mrs. Green! Okay I\xc2\x92m really sorry!! I\xc2\x92m apologizing for the\xc2\x97(She\ntrips and falls down the stairs.) (Pause) Okay, I bit my tongue, but I\xc2\x92m still\nreally sorry!'

Rachel	 (closing a book) Okay! I\xc2\x92m ready.'
Ross	 You sure?'
Rachel	 Yes, I\xc2\x92ve done my studying and I really know my stuff.'
Ross	 All right then. (Gets up, in an announcer\xc2\x92s voice) Rachel Green!\nLet\xc2\x92s play Bamboozled! (Reading from a note card.) How do you test the temperature of\nthe baby\xc2\x92s bath water?'
Rachel	 Uh, put your elbow in it.'
Ross	 Excellent! How do you put a baby down for a nap?'
Rachel	 Full, dry, on its back, and no loose covers.'
Ross	 That\xc2\x92s correct! This is an audio question, what do you do when the\nbaby makes this sound? (Makes a sound like someone is choking a cat.)'
Rachel	 Check if it\xc2\x92s wet, check if it\xc2\x92s hungry, burp it!'
Ross	 Excellent! Excellent, now-now do you want another question or a Wicked\nWango card?'
Rachel	 A card! A card! I pick a card!'
Ross	 Oh, I\xc2\x92m sorry you\xc2\x92ve been Bamboozled! You\xc2\x92re gonna be a\nterrible mother! (Rachel stares at him agape.) I\xc2\x92ve lost sight of why we\xc2\x92re\ndoing this! (Rachel gets up and walks away.)'
