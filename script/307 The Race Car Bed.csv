Ross	 So I told Carl, \xc2\x91Nobody, no matter how famous their parents are,\nnobody is allowed to climb on the dinosaur.\xc2\x92 But of course this went in one ear and\nout.....'
Rachel	 I love how he cares so much about stuff. If I squint I can pretend\nhe\xc2\x92s Alan Alda.'
Monica	 Oh good, another dinosaur story. When are those gonna become extinct?'
Chandler	 If I was a superhero who could fly and be invisible, that\nwould be the best.'
Gunther	 What does Rachel see in this guy? I love Rachel. I wish she was my\nwife.'
Phoebe	 Who\xc2\x92s singing?'

Ross	 Hey. When you guys were kids and you played Happy Days, who were\nyou? I was always Richie.'
Monica	 I was always Joanne.'
Joey	 Question. Was ah, \xc2\x91Egg the Gellers!\xc2\x92 the war cry of your\nneighbourhood?'
Phoebe	 Ewww! Oh! It\xc2\x92s the Mattress King!'
Joey	 Booo!!'
Chandler	 (to Janice) Don\xc2\x92t look honey. Change the channel! Change the\nchannel!'
Janice	 Wait! Wait! I wanna see this. After I divorce him, half of that kingdom\nis gonna be mine.'
Matress King	 (on TV) \xc2\x91Despair fills the mattress showroom. My kingdom\nis suddenly without a queen. I\xc2\x92m so depressed I\xc2\x92m going to slash... my prices!!\nCheck it out! Four ninety-nine for a pillow top queen set! I\xc2\x92m going medieval on\nprices!'
Chandler	 What a wank!'
Janice	 Oh, I cannot believe he\xc2\x92s using our divorce to sell mattresses.'
Monica	 I know! And four ninety-nine for a pillow top queen set, who cares about\nthe divorce, those babies will sell themselves. (they all stare at her) And I\xc2\x92m\nappalled for you by the way.'
Matress King	 (on TV) I\xc2\x92m close. I\xc2\x92m cheap. I\xc2\x92m the king.'
Rachel	 \xc2\x91Okay. (listens) Okay, daddy we\xc2\x92ll see you tomorrow night.\n(listens) Okay bye-bye.\xc2\x92 (hangs up)'
Ross	 We?'
Rachel	 Are ah, having dinner with my Dad tomorrow night, I hope that\xc2\x92s\nokay.'
Ross	 Oh shoot, tomorrow\xc2\x92s not so good, I\xc2\x92m supposed to um, fall off\nthe Empire State building and land on a bicycle with no seat. Sorry.'
Rachel	 Ross, my father doesn\xc2\x92t hate you.'
Ross	 Please, he refers to me as \xc2\x91wethead\xc2\x92.'
Rachel	 But honey he calls everybody by a nickname! Okay, look, I know, all\nright, just one dinner, please, just one night for me, please. I just want him to love you\nlike I do. (Ross looks at her) All right, well not exactly like I do, but, but, if you do\ncome to dinner, I\xc2\x92ll love you like I do in that black thing that you like.'
Chandler	 (leaning in) I\xc2\x92ll go.'
Ross	 Fine.'
Rachel	 Thank you.'
Ross	 Hi Gunther.'
Gunther	 Yeah, we\xc2\x92ll see!'
Joey	 (entering) Hey, you guys!'
Phoebe	 Hey!'
Joey	 Guess what?'
Ross	 What?'
Joey	 I got a gig!'
All	 Yay!!'
Chandler	 See, that\xc2\x92s why I could never be an actor. Because I can\xc2\x92t\nsay gig.'
Phoebe	 Yeah, I can\xc2\x92t say croissant. (realises) Oh my God!'
Monica	 What\xc2\x92s the part?'
Joey	 Well, it\xc2\x92s not a part, no. I\xc2\x92m teaching acting for soap operas\ndown at the Learning Extension.'
Ross	 Come on! That\xc2\x92s great.'
All	 Wow!'
Joey	 Yeah, yeah. It\xc2\x92s like my chance to give something back to the acting\ncommunity.'
Ross	 Y\xc2\x92know your probably not allowed to sleep with any of your students.'
Joey	 (glares at him) I know!'
Phoebe	 Ugh! I don\xc2\x92t know Monica. It feels funny just being here. I mean if\nyou buy a bed from Janice\xc2\x92s ex-husband, that\xc2\x92s like betraying Chandler.'
Monica	 Not at these prices.'
Phoebe	 (sees a little kid playing with a race car bed) (to kid) Hi. Y'know in\nEngland this car would be on the other side of the store. (the kid just stares at her, and\nshe makes the \xc2\x91that went right over your head\xc2\x92 motion) Woo!"
Monica	 (lying down on a mattress) Oh! Ohhhhh! Oh! Phoebe, come here. Aw, this\nis my new bed. You gotta feel this bad boy.'
Phoebe	 Eh, Monica it, it feels so weird, y'know, Chandler\xc2\x92s your friend...\n(hops onto the bed) Oh! Oh my God! Aw, all right take this bed, you can make other\nfriends."
Joey	 Good evening. I\xc2\x92m Mr. Tribbiani. And I will be teaching acting for\nsoap operas. Now um, on my first day as (proudly) Dr. Drake Remoray on Days of Our\nLives, (looks for a reaction from his students, and gets none.) I learned that one of\nthe most important things in soap opera acting is reacting, this does not mean acting\nagain, it means, you don\xc2\x92t have a line, but someone else just did. And it goes like\nthis. (looks all intense for a moment and then gasps, the students cheer him) Thanks,\nthanks, a lot. Oh, by the way, before I forget to work in soap operas some of you will\nhave to become much more attractive. All right, moving right along.'
Joey	 Hi!'
Phoebe	 Hey! Ooh! How was teaching last night?'
Joey	 Oh it was great. Yeah, you get to say stuff like, \xc2\x92Hey, the bell\ndoesn\xc2\x92t dismiss you, I dismiss you.\xc2\x92'
Phoebe	 Ooooh, nice.'
Joey	 Oh, and guess what, I got an audition for All My Children.'
Phoebe	 Oh, yay!'
Joey	 Yeah, it\xc2\x92s this great part, this boxer named Nick. And I\xc2\x92m so,\nso right for it, y'know, he\xc2\x92s just like me. Except he\xc2\x92s a boxer, and has an evil\ntwin."
Phoebe	 Oh. (goes and answers the door and there is this huge black\ndelievery guy.) '
Guy	 Dom da-da dom! Here ye! Here ye! Delivery from the Mattress King. (to\nPhoebe) You Miss Geller?'
Phoebe	 Okay.'
Guy	 Sign here. (hands her a clipboard)'
Phoebe	 Oh, do I have a middle name. All right Monica Velula Geller. It\xc2\x92s\nthat bedroom there. (points to Monica\xc2\x92s room)'
Joey	 Hey, Monica bought a bed from the Mattress King?'
Phoebe	 Yeah, so please, please, please, don\xc2\x92t say anything to Chandler.'
Joey	 You want me to lie to Chandler?'
Phoebe	 Is that a problem?'
Joey	 No.'
Phoebe	 Oh, hey, hey Nick the boxer let\xc2\x92s see what you got. All right ya,\nput \xc2\x91em up. Come on. (they start shadow boxing)'
Joey	 Hey, you\xc2\x92re ah, pretty good at this.'
Phoebe	 Yeah, well I had to learn, I was staying at the Y and some off the young\nmen weren\xc2\x92t acting Christian enough.'
Joey	 Ahh!'
Joey	 Hey now!'
Joey	 Hey!!! Oww!! And I\xc2\x92m bleeding.'
Phoebe	 Oh! Oh! Oh!'
Joey	 Okay, great.'
Phoebe	 Wow! And I\xc2\x92m a vegetarian! All right, all right, well I\xc2\x92m\nsorry, we\xc2\x92ll put some ice on it. '
Joey	 Okay.'
Phoebe	 \xc2\x91Kay, put your head back.'
Joey	 All right. I can\xc2\x92t see.'
Phoebe	 All right, I have ya. Oh God.'
Guy	 Which bedroom do ya want it in Miss Geller?'
Phoebe	 Oh, it\xc2\x92s the compulsively neat one by the window, okay.'
Guy	 Gotcha. (he and his helper walk in carrying the racecar bed.)'
Rachel	 Hi Daddy!'
Dr. Green	 This where they put it? What, there no table available in the\nkitchen! Hello, baby.'
Rachel	 You remember Ross.'
Dr. Green	 Um-hmm.'
Ross	 Nice to see you again Dr. Green. '
Dr. Green	 So! (they both try to sit next to Rachel but Dr. Green is\nsuccessful.) (to Ross) How\xc2\x92s the library?'
Ross	 Ugh, museum.'
Dr. Green	 What happened to the library?'
Ross	 There never was a library. I mean there are libraries, its just that I ah,\nI never worked at one.'
Dr. Green	 You know what\xc2\x92s really good here, the lobster. What do you say\nshall I just order three.'
Ross	 Yeah, if you\xc2\x92re really hungry. (Dr. Green stares at him) It was a\njoke, I made a joke.'
Rachel	 Yeah, actually Daddy Ross is allergic to lobster.'
Dr. Green	 What kind of person is allergic to lobster? I guess the kind of\nperson that works at a library.'
Ross	 It\xc2\x92s not a library...'
Dr. Green	 (interrupting him) I know!! It\xc2\x92s a museum! What, you\xc2\x92re the\nonly one around here who can make a joke! At least mine was funny. Ah, waiter, we will\nhave two lobsters and a menu. (nods at Ross, and mouths I don\xc2\x92t know to the waiter.)'
Ross	 So, Dr. Green, how\xc2\x92s the old boat.'
Dr. Green	 They found rust. You know what rust does to a boat?'
Ross	 It gives it a nice antiquey look.'
Dr. Green	 (he stares at Ross) Rust, is boat cancer, Ross.'
Ross	 Wow. I\xc2\x92m sorry, when I was a kid I lost a bike to that. (Rachel\ngiggles at that)'
Dr. Green	 Excuse me for a moment, will you please, I want to say good night to\nthe Levines, before we go.'
Rachel	 Okay.'
Ross	 Okay! (picks up a knife and pretends to stab his heart.)'
Rachel	 Aw honey stop! It\xc2\x92s not that bad.'
Ross	 Yeah. (sees the bill) Op! Uh-oh! I think your Dad must\xc2\x92ve added\nwrong. He only tipped like four percent.'
Rachel	 Yeah. That\xc2\x92s Daddy.'
Ross	 That\xc2\x92s Daddy?! But doesn\xc2\x92t it bother you? You\xc2\x92re a\nwaitress.'
Rachel	 Yes, it bothers me Ross, but y'know if he was a regular at the coffee\nhouse, I\xc2\x92d be serving him sneezers."
Ross	 So?'
Rachel	 So. Ross, I\xc2\x92ve bugged him about this a million times, he\xc2\x92s not\ngonna change.'
Ross	 You really serve people sneezers?'
Rachel	 Well um, I don\xc2\x92t.'
Dr Green	 You kids ready?'
Ross	 Thanks again, Dr. Green.'
Dr. Green	 All right.'
Dr. Green	 Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, I think I forgot my receipt.'
Ross	 Oh, ah, you don\xc2\x92t need that.'
Dr. Green	 Why not?'
Ross	 The carbon, it\xc2\x92s messy, I mean it gets on your fingers and causes,\nthe, the ah, night blindness.'
Dr. Green	 (gets his receipt and notices the twenty) What is this? Who put a\ntwenty down here? Huh?'
Ross	 Oh, yeah, that would be me, um, I have, I have a problem I-I tip way too\nmuch, way, way, too much, it\xc2\x92s a sickness really.'
Rachel	 Yeah it is, it is. (to Ross) We really, really have to do something\nabout that.'
Ross	 I know.'
Dr. Green	 Excuse me, you think I\xc2\x92m cheap?'
Rachel	 Oh Daddy, no he didn\xc2\x92t mean anything by that, he really\ndidn\xc2\x92t.'
Ross	 Nothing I do means anything, really.'
Dr. Green	 This is nice. I pay two hundred dollars for dinner, you put down\ntwenty, and you come out looking like Mr. Big Shot. You really want to be Mr. Big Shot?\nHere, I\xc2\x92ll tell you what, you pay the whole bill, Mr. Big Shot, all right. (rips up\nthe bill, and throws it at Ross, then leaves)'
Ross	 Well Mr. Big Shot is better than \xc2\x91wethead\xc2\x92.'
Joey	 Okay, some tricks of the trade. Now, I\xc2\x92ve never been able to cry as\nan actor, so if I\xc2\x92m in a scene where I have to cry, I cut a hole in my pocket, take a\npair of tweezers, and just start pulling. Or ah, or, let\xc2\x92s say I wanna convey that\nI\xc2\x92ve just done something evil. That would be the basic \xc2\x91I have a fishhook in my\neyebrow and I like it\xc2\x92 (Does it by raising one eyebrow, and showing off the pretend\nfishhook.) Okay, let\xc2\x92s say I\xc2\x92ve just gotten bad news, well all I do there is try\nand divide 232 by 13. (looks all confused) And that\xc2\x92s how it\xc2\x92s done. Great soap\nopera acting tonight everybody, class dismissed.'
Student	 Hey, Mr. Trib.'
Joey	 Hey-hey.'
Student	 Guess what, I got an audition!'
Joey	 Awww, one of my students got an audition. I\xc2\x92m so proud.'
Student	 I was wondering if you would consider coaching me for it?'
Joey	 You bet! What\xc2\x92s the part?'
Student	 Oh it\xc2\x92s great, it\xc2\x92s a role on All My Children, Nick\nthe boxer.'

Rachel	 You had to do it, didn\xc2\x92t you? You couldn\xc2\x92t just leave it\nalone.'
Ross	 Four percent. Okay. I tip more than that when there\xc2\x92s a bug in my\nfood.'
Rachel	 Ross, tonight was about the two of you getting along. (Ross groans and\nrubs his neck) Oh, would you just see my chiropractor, already.'
Ross	 Yeah, I\xc2\x92m gonna go to a doctor who went to school in a mini-mall.'
Ross	 Hey Pheebs, what are you doing?'
Phoebe	 I\xc2\x92m, I\xc2\x92m freaking out! Monica kinda trusted me with something\nand she shouldn\xc2\x92t have! All right, I haven\xc2\x92t lived here in a while, so I have to\nask you something. Does Monica still turn on the lights in her bedroom?'
Rachel	 Um. yeah.'
Phoebe	 I am soo dead. (goes to Monica\xc2\x92s room)'
Rachel	 All right, look, here\xc2\x92s the bottom line Ross, this is fixable, if\nwe act fast, okay. So, I\xc2\x92ll invite him to brunch tomorrow and you can make nice.'
Ross	 Look, honey, I have tried to make nice, it doesn\xc2\x92t work.'
Rachel	 Okay, look, Ross, I realise that my Father is difficult, but that\xc2\x92s\nwhy you have got to be the bigger man here.'
Ross	 Look sweetie, I could be the bigger man, I could be the biggest man, I\ncould be a big, huge, giant man, and it still wouldn\xc2\x92t make any difference, except\nthat I could pick your Father up and say \xc2\x91Like me! Like me tiny doctor!\xc2\x92'
Rachel	 Okay, well can\xc2\x92t you just try it one more time Ross? For me? For\nme?'
Ross	 Rachel one brunch is not gonna solve anything. You gotta face it, okay\nwe\xc2\x92re never gonna get along.'
Rachel	 Okay, well you are just gonna have too, okay. Because I already got a\nMother and a Father who cannot stay in the same room together, okay, I don\xc2\x92t wanna\nhave to have a separate room for you too!! (starts to cry)'
Ross	 Okay, okay, okay. (hugs her) I\xc2\x92ll get the bagels.'
Monica	 (sees the bed) What\xc2\x92s this?'
Phoebe	 Isn\xc2\x92t it cool! Varoom! Varoom!'
Monica	 This is not the bed I ordered!'
Phoebe	 I know, you must\xc2\x92ve won like a contest or something! '
Monica	 Phoebe!'
Monica	 Why is this car in my bedroom?'
Phoebe	 I\xc2\x92m sorry, okay, I-I wasn\xc2\x92t looking, and the store says that\nthey won\xc2\x92t take it back because you signed for it...'
Monica	 When did I sign for it?'
Phoebe	 When I was you! Y'know what, it\xc2\x92s all Joey\xc2\x92s fault,\n\xc2\x91cause he left his nose open!"
Monica	 Did you make brownies today?'
Chandler	 Knock, knock.'
Monica	 (to Phoebe) Quick, take off your dress, he won\xc2\x92t notice the bed.'
Chandler	 Hey, I\xc2\x92m going for sushi does anybody want.. (enters and sees the\nbed) Whoa-whoa, somebody missed the off ramp.'
Phoebe	 It\xc2\x92s Monica\xc2\x92s bed. What?'
Chandler	 Okay. (to Monica) It\xc2\x92s a racecar.'
Phoebe	 So. This has always been Monica\xc2\x92s bed, what you\xc2\x92re just\nnoticing now, how self-involved are you?'
Chandler	 Okay, well it this bed isn\xc2\x92t new, how come there is plastic on\nthe mattress?'
Monica	 Sometimes I have bad dreams. (starts to break down, and Phoebe offers\nher, her hand to comfort her.)'
Student	 Look, I just saw my best friends brains smeared across the canvas,\nthat\xc2\x92s not gonna be me, not me.'
Joey	 Wow! That was good. That was...(points to his pocket) Tweezers?'
Student	 No.'
Joey	 Whoa. That was really good.'
Student	 Thanks, any suggestions?'
Chandler	 You told him to play the boxer gay!!'
Joey	 Well, I-I might\xc2\x92ve said supergay.'
Chandler	 You totally screwed him over.'
Monica	 Joey, you\xc2\x92re this guy\xc2\x92s teacher. I mean how could you do this?'
Joey	 Because, Monica, the guy\xc2\x92s so good, and I really, really want this\npart.'
Phoebe	 Well, if you really, really want it, then it\xc2\x92s okay.'
Rachel	 (opening the door) Hi Daddy.'
Dr. Green	 Baby. Ross.'
Ross	 Dr. Green. How are you? (offers his hand, and Dr. Green puts his scarf on\nit.)'
Dr. Green	 Thanks for dinner last night.'
Ross	 Thank you for teaching me a valuable lesson.'
Dr. Green	 Nice hair. What\xc2\x92d ya do? Swim here?'
Ross	 (to Rachel) Okay, that\xc2\x92s it, I can\xc2\x92t take it anymore.'
Rachel	 What? What? He\xc2\x92s interested in you. He-he likes your hair, he just\nwants to know how you got here.'
Ross	 Oh, please. Sweetie it\xc2\x92s hopeless, okay, I\xc2\x92m just gonna go.\n(starts to leave rubbing his neck)'
Rachel	 What?!'
Ross	 Look, look I\xc2\x92m sorry. It\xc2\x92s just that....'
Dr. Green	 Ross? What\xc2\x92s with the neck?'
Rachel	 He\xc2\x92s got this thing. And I keep telling him to go to my\nchiropractor...'
Dr. Green	 You\xc2\x92re still going to that chiropractor, that man couldn\xc2\x92t\nget into medical school in Extapa!'
Ross	 Thank you! That\xc2\x92s what I keep saying.'
Rachel	 Excuse me, Dr. Bobby happens to be an excellent doctor.'
Ross	 Uh.'
Dr. Green	 Wait a minute, his name is Dr. Bobby?'
Rachel	 Well that\xc2\x92s his last name.'
Ross	 And his first name.'
Dr. Green	 He\xc2\x92s Bobby Bobby?'
Rachel	 It\xc2\x92s Robert Bobby.'
Dr. Green	 Oh.'
Rachel	 And um, excuse me, he helps me.'
Ross	 Oh-ho please. Ask her how?'
Dr. Green	 What do you need help for?'
Rachel	 With my alignment. I\xc2\x92ve got one leg shorter than the other.'
Dr. Green	 Oh God!'
Ross	 Argue with that.'
Rachel	 What? It\xc2\x92s true, my right leg is two inches shorter.'
Dr. Green	 Come on! You\xc2\x92re just titling! (to Ross) Her legs are fine!'
Ross	 I know that!'
Dr. Green	 So, why do you let her go to a chiropractor for?'
Rachel	 I\xc2\x92m sorry, let her?'
Ross	 What can I do, she doesn\xc2\x92t listen to me about renter\xc2\x92s insurance\neither.'
Dr. Green	 Wait a minute, you don\xc2\x92t have renter\xc2\x92s insurance?!'
Rachel	 No.'
Dr. Green	 Well what if somebody steals something? How are you gonna run after\nhim with one leg shorter than the other?!'
Ross	 Hey, would you ah, would you like some juice?'
Dr. Green	 I\xc2\x92d love some juice. Thanks.'
Ross	 Okay. (to Rachel) Wow! This is going so well. Did you see us? Did you see?'
Rachel	 Yeah honey, I\xc2\x92m standing right there! Why didn\xc2\x92t you just tell\nhim about the mole I haven\xc2\x92t got checked yet.'
Ross	 Excellent!'
Joey	 (sadly) There will come a time in each of your careers when you\xc2\x92ll\nhave a chance to screw over another soap opera actor. I had such an opportunity in the\nrecent, present. And I\xc2\x92m ashamed to say that I took it, I advised a fellow actor to\nplay a role, homosexually. Yeah, we both auditioned for the part, and uh, as it turned\nout, they ah, they liked the stupid gay thing and cast him. And now, he\xc2\x92s got a two\nyear contract opposite Susan Luchhi, the first lady of daytime television, and me, me\nI\xc2\x92m stuck here teaching a bunch of people, most of whom are too ugly to even be on\nTV. I\xc2\x92m sorry, I\xc2\x92m sorry, I\xc2\x92m sorry. (he gets a huge round of applause from\nhis students.) Thank you.'
Jester	 Uh, may I help you?'
Monica	 Yeah, I talked to you on the phone, I\xc2\x92m the lady that got stuck\nwith the racecar bed.'
Jester	 Look, it\xc2\x92s like I told you, there\xc2\x92s nothing I can do. You\nsigned for it, Monica Velula Geller.'
Joey	 All right, Jester man, look we wanna see the king.'
Jester	 Nobody sees the king!'
Joey	 Oh-ho-kay, I\xc2\x92m talking to the king. (starts to go to a back room)'
Jester	 Hey! You can\xc2\x92t go back there!'
Janice	 Oh my God.'

Chandler	 Varrrrrroom! Hey! Watch it lady! Varrrrrrrrrrom! (makes a screeching\nsound as he pretends to stomp on the brakes.) Hey-hey good lookin\xc2\x92! (honks the\nbed\xc2\x92s little horn on the steering wheel.) Varrrrrrrrroom. (notices Rachel and stops)\nAll right, I\xc2\x92ll leave. My bed\xc2\x92s so boring.'
