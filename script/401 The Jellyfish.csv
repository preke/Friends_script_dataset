Joey	 (lying on a beach towel, recapping what happened in the last episode)\nOkay, so we went to the beach, because Phoebe found out about this lady who knew her mom\nand dad, and I don\xc2\x92t really know what happened with that.'
Phoebe Sr.	 (to Phoebe) I\xc2\x92m your mother.'
Phoebe	 Ehh?'
Joey	 (voice-over) Oh, and then Monica joked that she wouldn\xc2\x92t go out with\na guy like Chandler...'
Chandler	 (to Monica) (in a funny voice) Hi there. (Monica turns her head away\nin disgust)'
Joey	 (voice-over) ...and he couldn\xc2\x92t let it go, and... I don\xc2\x92t really\nknow what happened with that either. '
Joey	 (voice-over) Oh-oh! And then Ross\xc2\x92s new girlfriend, Bonnie, shows up\nand Rachel convinced her to save her head. And then Ross and Rachel kiss, and now Ross has\nto choose between Rachel and the bald girl and I don\xc2\x92t know what happened there\neither... '
Joey	 Y'know what, hold on, let me go get Chandler. (gets up and leaves.)"
Ross	 (surprised) Hi!'
Rachel and Bonnie	 Hi!'
Bonnie	 Rachel was just helping me out. My head got all sunburned.'
Ross	 Awww.'
Bonnie	 (to Rachel) Thanks a million.'
Rachel	 Oh, you\xc2\x92re welcome a million.'
Bonnie	 (getting up and leaving) (to Ross) Okay, I\xc2\x92ll see you in our room.'
Ross	 Yeah. (closes the door, and goes over and kisses Rachel.)'
Rachel	 (softly) Oh my God.'
Ross	 I know.'
Ross	 (stopping suddenly and getting up) Okay, I gotta go.'
Rachel	 Whoa! What?! Why?!'
Ross	 Well, I-I gotta go break up with Bonnie.'
Rachel	 Here?! Now?!'
Ross	 Well, yeah. I can\xc2\x92t-I can\xc2\x92t stay here all night, and if I go in\nthere she\xc2\x92s-she\xc2\x92s gonna wanna... do stuff.'
Rachel	 Well, can\xc2\x92t you tell her that you are not in the mood?'
Ross	 No, she likes that. Yeah. Faking sleep doesn\xc2\x92t work either, I\ncan\xc2\x92t tell you how many mornings I woke up with her...'
Rachel	 (interrupting) Whoa-ho.'
Ross	 Whoa-oh, okay! Yeah, why am I telling you that?'
Rachel	 I don\xc2\x92t know.'
Ross	 Yeah, yeah. (opens the door) It wasn\xc2\x92t every morning.'
Rachel	 Oh, making it worse!'
Ross	 Okay.'

Phoebe Sr.	 So I guess you\xc2\x92d like to know how it all happened. '
Phoebe	 I-I mean I, well I think I can figure it out. I guess y'know I was born,\nand everyone started lying their asses off!"
Phoebe Sr.	 Noo! No! It wasn\xc2\x92t like that I... Remember how I told you how\nLily, Frank, and I we were, we were close. Well, we were, we were very close.'
Phoebe	 How close?'
Phoebe Sr.	 Well, the-the three of us we were, kind of umm, a couple.'
Phoebe	 I don\xc2\x92t even know how that would work!'
Phoebe Sr.	 Well, we were...'
Phoebe	 (interrupting) I\xc2\x92m not asking!'
Phoebe Sr.	 Well, any how, some how I got pregnant, and, and I was scared. I was\nstupid and sellfish, and I was 18 years old. I mean, you remember what it\xc2\x92s like to\nbe eighteen years old?'
Phoebe	 Yeah. Let\xc2\x92s see, my had Mom killed herself, and my Dad had run off,\nand I was living in a Gremlin with a guy named Cindy who talked to his hand.'
Phoebe Sr.	 Well, I\xc2\x92m so sorry. I thought I was leaving you with the best\nparents in the world, I didn\xc2\x92t even hear about your Mom and Dad til a couple of years\nago, and by then you were already grown up. I don\xc2\x92t know, you\xc2\x92re here, and I\nwould, I would really, I would like to get to know you.'
Phoebe	 Yeah, well, everybody does! I\xc2\x92m a really cool person. And y'know\nyou had 29 years to find that out, but you didn\xc2\x92t even try! Y'know what, you walked\nout on me, and I\xc2\x92m just, I\xc2\x92m gonna do the same thing to you."
Phoebe Sr.	 Wait!'
Phoebe	 I don\xc2\x92t ever want to see you again! '
Phoebe	 (walking back in with her hand over her eyes.) Umm, where\xc2\x92s my\npurse?'
Monica	 (closing the fridge in disgust) Shoot! We\xc2\x92re out of soda.'
Chandler	 (jumping up) Oh, I\xc2\x92ll go out and get you some.'
Monica	 Really?!'
Chandler	 Nope! Because I\xc2\x92m not your boyfriend. (to Phoebe, who\xc2\x92s\nentering) Hey Pheebs, how did it go?'
Phoebe	 Well, umm, my Mom\xc2\x92s friend, Phoebe, is actually my birth Mom.'
Chandler	 I found a dried up seashores.'
Monica	 Sweety, what are you talking about?'
Phoebe	 Oh, my new Mom, who-who\xc2\x92s a big, fat abandoner! (starts to go\nupstairs)'
Joey	 Whoa, wait, Pheebs, wait a second! Don\xc2\x92t you wanna stay here and talk\nabout it?'
Phoebe	 No. I\xc2\x92m just, I wanna, I need to be alone.'
Phoebe	 (turning around, insistently) Monica!'
Monica	 Oh.'
Ross	 It\xc2\x92s over.'
Rachel	 Oh, was it awful?'
Ross	 Well, it was loong. I didn\xc2\x92t even realise how late it was, until I\nnoticed the 5 o\xc2\x92clock shadow on her head. (They both start to laugh, then stop\nthemselves quickly.) Anyway, she didn\xc2\x92t want to stay. I called a cab; she just left.'
Rachel	 I wrote you a letter.'
Ross	 Ohh! Thank you! I like mail. (He goes to kiss her again, but she turns\naway.)'
Rachel	 (handing him the letter) It\xc2\x92s just some things I\xc2\x92ve been\nthinking about. Some things about us, and before we can even think about the two of us\ngetting back together, I just need to know how you feel about this stuff.'
Ross	 Okay. (He leans in to kiss her again, but she leans back preventing him\nfrom making contact.) Wow, it\xc2\x92s-it\xc2\x92s 5
Rachel	 Well, I\xc2\x92ll be waiting for you, just come up when you\xc2\x92re done.'
Ross	 Okay, I\xc2\x92ll be up in, (looks at the letter) 18 pages. Front and back.\nVery exciting.'
Ross	 Oh. (looks at his watch) Oh-oh. (takes a drink of coffee and resumes\nreading the letter)'
Rachel	 (coming down the stairs) Hey! (Ross jumps up, and quickly puts the\nletter back together, pretending like he has just finished it.) What happened to you? Why\ndidn\xc2\x92t you come up?'
Ross	 Done!'
Rachel	 You just finished?'
Ross	 Well, I wanted to be thorough. I mean this-this is clearly very, very\nimportant to you, to us! And so I wanted to read every word carefully, twice!'
Rachel	 So umm, does it?'
Ross	 I\xc2\x92m sorry.'
Rachel	 Does it?'
Ross	 Does it? Does it? Yeah, I wanted to give that whole \xc2\x91Does it?\xc2\x92\npart just another glance.'
Rachel	 What are you talking about, Ross, you just said that you read it twice!\nLook, y'know what, either it does or it doesn\xc2\x92t, and if you have to even think\nabout it..."
Ross	 (interrupting) No, Rach, no. I don\xc2\x92t, I don\xc2\x92t, I don\xc2\x92t have\nto think about it, in fact, I\xc2\x92ve decided, I\xc2\x92ve decided that, that it.......does.'
Rachel	 Are you sure?'
Ross	 Oh, sure! I\xc2\x92m sure.'
Rachel	 I know. (Hugs him more violently this time and pushes him back away from\nthe letter.)'
Chandler	 All right, there\xc2\x92s a nuclear holocaust, I\xc2\x92m the last man on\nEarth. Would you go out with me?'
Monica	 Ennnh.'
Chandler	 I\xc2\x92ve got canned goods.'
Joey	 (jumping up in a hole that he is digging, he is shoulder deep) Hey, you\nguys! Take a look at this! (Chandler and Monica jump up and go over to the hole.) Check\nthis baby out, dug me a hole!'
Chandler	 Excellent hole, Joe.'
Joey	 Oh no! No!! My hole!!'
Monica	 (screaming in pain) Ow!! Ow!!!'
Joey	 (climbing out of the hole) What?! What?!! What is it?!'
Monica	 Jellyfish sting! Oh, it hurts! It hurts!! It hurts!!'
Chandler	 Well, can we help?! You want us to take you back to the house?!'
Monica	 It\xc2\x92s like two miles!'
Joey	 Yeah, and I\xc2\x92m a little tired from digging the hole.'
Monica	 Oh damn the jellyfish. Damn all the jellyfish!'
Chandler	 We\xc2\x92ve got to do something!'
Joey	 Well, there\xc2\x92s really only one thing you can do.'
Monica	 What?! What is it?!'
Joey	 You\xc2\x92re gonna have to pee on it.'
Monica	 What?!! Gross!!'
Joey	 Don\xc2\x92t blame me, I saw it on The Discovery Channel.'
Chandler	 Y'know what, he\xc2\x92s right. There\xc2\x92s something like uh, ammonia\nin that, that like kills the pain."
Monica	 Well forget it! It doesn\xc2\x92t hurt that (tries to take a step) baaad!!!!'
Joey	 If you want some privacy you can use my hole.'
Phoebe	 Well, I\xc2\x92m ready to get the hell out of here! (Sees Ross and Rachel\ncuddling on the couch.) Oh. Are you? Are you?!! (they nod \xc2\x91Yes.\xc2\x92) Ohh!\nThat\xc2\x92s so great!! Ooh, not for Bonnie. (they nod \xc2\x91No.\xc2\x92) But for you, yay!\nOhh.'
Ross	 Hey!'
Rachel	 How was the beach?'
Monica	 Nothing, I don\xc2\x92t know.'
Ross	 What happened?'
Monica	 Nothing. I\xc2\x92m gonna take a shower.'
Chandler	 Me too!!'
Joey	 Me too.'
Phoebe	 Okay, I\xc2\x92m gonna put this (her suitcase) in the car.'
Rachel	 Ooh, I have to go pack. (Gets up to do so.) It really does?'
Ross	 It does. It really and truly does.'
Ross	 (finding the part) (looks up in disgust) It so does not!!!'

Ross	 She wants me to take responsibility for everything that went wrong\nin our relationship. I mean she goes on for five pages about, about how I was unfaithful\nto her! (Both Joey and Chandler shrug their shoulders as to say \xc2\x94Well...\xc2\x94)\n(yelling) WE WERE ON A BREAK!!!!!'
Chandler	 Oh my God! If you say that one more time, I\xc2\x92m gonna break\nup with you!'
Ross	 Fine! Fine! But this break-up was not all my fault, and she, she says\nhere, (reading from the letter) \xc2\x93If you accept full responsibility...\xc2\x94 (to\nChandler and Joey) Full responsibility! \xc2\x93...I can begin to trust you again. Does that\nseem like something you can do. (yells at Joey) Does it?!!\xc2\x94'
Joey	 No?'
Chandler	 Look, Ross, you have what you want, you\xc2\x92re back with Rachel. If\nyou bring this up now you\xc2\x92re gonna wreck the best thing that even happened to you.'
Ross	 (calming down) Yeah, I know. I mean, no, you\xc2\x92re right. Yeah I guess\nI\xc2\x92ll let it go. But you-you understand how-how hard it is to forget about this.'
Joey	 Sure, it\xc2\x92s hard to forget! But that doesn\xc2\x92t mean you have to\ntalk about it! A lot of things happened on that trip that we should never, (to Chandler)\never talk about.'
Ross	 What the hell happened on that beach?!'
Joey	 It\xc2\x92s between us and the sea, Ross!'
Phoebe	 (to the person that answered the door) Hi, Ursula.'
Ursula	 Hey!'
Phoebe	 Okay, well umm, I know that we haven\xc2\x92t talked in a long time, but\numm okay, our Mom is not our birth Mom. This-this other lady is our birth Mom.'
Ursula	 Right, okay, the one that lives in Montuak, umm-hmm.'
Phoebe	 (shocked) You know her?!'
Ursula	 No, I umm, I read about her in Mom\xc2\x92s suicide note.'
Phoebe	 There-there was a suicide note?! (Ursula nods \xc2\x91Yes.\xc2\x92) Well, do\nyou still have it?'
Ursula	 (disgusted) Hang on. (She goes into her apartment and slams the door in\nPhoebe\xc2\x92s face.)'
Phoebe	 I can\xc2\x92t believe you didn\xc2\x92t tell me there was a suicide note!'
Ursula	 Yeah. So how have you been doing?'
Phoebe	 I, umm, shut up!'
Phoebe	 (reading from the note) \xc2\x93Good-bye Phoebe and Ursula. I\xc2\x92ll miss\nyou. P.S. Your Mom lives in Montauk.\xc2\x94 You just wrote this!'
Ursula	 Well, it\xc2\x92s pretty much the gist. Well, except for the poem. You\nread the poem, right?'
Phoebe	 Noooo!!'
Ursula	 All right, hang on! (She takes the note, goes back into her apartment\nand slams the door shut.)'
Monica	 Pass the cheese, please.'
Monica	 My God, you can\xc2\x92t even look at me! Can you?'
Joey	 Nope.'
Chandler	 (jumping up) Hey! Phoebe! We can talk to Phoebe!!'
Phoebe	 No. I\xc2\x92m-I\xc2\x92m to depressed to talk.'
Chandler	 I\xc2\x92ll give you a thousand dollars to talk to us.'
Ross	 (coming back in with Rachel) Hey, you guys! What do you, what do you think\nabout making that beach trip an annual thing?'
Chandler, Monica, and Joey	 NO!!!'
Rachel	 All right, that\xc2\x92s it, you guys! What happened out there?'
Monica	 What? We took a walk, nothing happened. I can back with nothing all over\nme.'
Ross and Rachel	 Come on!'
Ross	 What happened? Joey?'
Joey	 All right. (gets up) '
Monica	 (stopping him) No! Joey, we swore we\xc2\x92d never tell!'
Chandler	 (running over and joining Monica) They\xc2\x92ll never understand!'
Joey	 Well, we have to say something! We have to get it out! It\xc2\x92s eating me\nalive!! Monica got stung by a jellyfish.'
Monica	 (interrupting) All right!! All right. (walks slowly into the living\nroom) I got stung. Stung bad. I couldn\xc2\x92t stand. I-I couldn\xc2\x92t walk.'
Chandler	 (following Monica) We were two miles from the house. Scared and alone.\nWe didn\xc2\x92t think we could make it. (He goes to put his hands on Monica\xc2\x92s\nshoulders but for some reason can quite complete the action and pulls back.)'
Monica	 I was in too much pain.'
Joey	 And I was tired from digging the huge hole!'
Chandler	 And then Joey remembered something.'
Joey	 I\xc2\x92d seen this thing on The Discovery Channel...'
Ross	 Wait a minute! I saw that! On The Discovery Channel, yeah! About\njellyfish and how if you... (stops suddenly and turns to look at Monica) Ewwww!! You peed\non yourself?!'
Phoebe and Rachel	 Ewwww!!'
Monica	 You can\xc2\x92t say that!! You-you don\xc2\x92t know!! I mean I thought I\nwas gonna pass out from the pain! Anyway I-I tried, but I-I couldn\xc2\x92t...bend that way.\nSo... (looks at Joey.)'
Phoebe, Ross, and Rachel	 (turning to look at Joey) Ewwww!!'
Joey	 That\xc2\x92s right I stepped up! She\xc2\x92s my friend and she needed help!\nAnd if I had too, I\xc2\x92d pee on anyone of you! Only, uhh, I couldn\xc2\x92t. I got the\nstage fright. I wanted to help, but there was too much pressure. So-so I uh, I turned to\nChandler.'
Chandler	 (wails loudly into his hands) Joey kept screaming at me, \xc2\x93Do it\nnow! Do it!! Do it! Do it now!!\xc2\x94 Sometimes late at night I can still here the\nscreaming.'
Joey	 (laughs) That\xc2\x92s \xc2\x91cause sometimes I just do it through my wall to\nfreak you out.'
Phoebe	 (singing) \xc2\x93...fuchsia and mauvvve. Those are the 66 colours of my\nbedroommmm.\xc2\x94 (applause) Thank you, thank you. Ohh, and I invite you to count the\ncolours in your bedroom. (Sees that Phoebe Sr. has entered, and to her) Except for you.\nYou go away.'
Phoebe Sr.	 I\xc2\x92ll go in a second, I-I just wanted to tell you that there\nhasn\xc2\x92t been a day where I didn\xc2\x92t regret giving you up.'
Phoebe	 Okay, bye.'
Phoebe Sr.	 No, I\xc2\x92m not done. I-I-I just want you to know that I, the\nreason I didn\xc2\x92t look you up was, well I was afraid that you\xc2\x92d react, just well\nlike, the way, the way you\xc2\x92re reacting right now, and can\xc2\x92t we just, y'know,\nstart from here?"
Phoebe	 No.'
Phoebe Sr.	 Sorry. But just one last thing. Y'know you came looking for family.\nI\xc2\x92m family, I\xc2\x92m it. Now, now I\xc2\x92m done. (starts to leave)"
Phoebe	 But, it\xc2\x92s not like we\xc2\x92re losing anything. Y'know?"
Phoebe Sr.	 Yeah, I guess you\xc2\x92re right.'
Phoebe	 It\xc2\x92s not like we-we know each other or anything. Or that have anything\nin common.'
Phoebe Sr.	 Well, I don\xc2\x92t know. I mean it\xc2\x92s not like we don\xc2\x92t\nhave anything in common. I mean I like uh, pizza.'
Phoebe	 I-I like pizza!'
Phoebe Sr.	 You do?! Wait, I like umm, the Beetles.'
Phoebe	 Oh my God, so do I!'
Phoebe Sr.	 I knew it, wow!!'
Phoebe	 Wait-wait-wait, wait! Puppies. Cute or ugly?'
Phoebe Sr.	 Ohh, so cute.'
Phoebe	 Uh-huh, well! But umm, still I\xc2\x92m-I\xc2\x92m mad at you.'
Phoebe Sr.	 I know. I\xc2\x92m mad at me too.'
Phoebe	 Well umm, do you wanna get something to eat? I\xc2\x92m kinda hungry.'
Phoebe Sr.	 Hey! Me too!'
Phoebe	 All right, stop it. Now you\xc2\x92re just doing it to freak me out.'
Rachel	 Oh-hooo, I missed you.'
Ross	 I missed you too.'
Rachel	 Ooh, I was soo nervous about that letter. But the way you owned up to\neverything, it just showed me how much you\xc2\x92ve grown. Y'know?"
Ross	 (getting miffed) I suppose.'
Rachel	 You have! Ross, you should give yourself credit. I mean my Mom never\nthought this would work out. It was all, \xc2\x93Once a cheater, always a cheater.\xc2\x94'
Ross	 (getting angry) Umm-hmm.'
Rachel	 Ooh, I just wish we hadn\xc2\x92t lost those four months, but if time was\nwhat you needed just to gain a little perspective...'
Ross	 (yelling from the bedroom) WE WERE ON A BREAK!!!!!!!'
Chandler	 (entering with Joey) (to Monica) Coffee house?'
Monica	 You bet.'
Ross	 And for the record, it took two people to break up this\nrelationship!!'
Rachel	 Yeah! You and that girl from that copy place, which yesterday you took\nfull responsibility for!!'
Ross	 I didn\xc2\x92t know what I was taking full responsibility for! Okay?! I\ndidn\xc2\x92t finish the whole letter!'
Rachel	 What?!!'
Ross	 I fell asleep!'
Rachel	 You fell asleep?!'
Ross	 It was 5
Rachel	 Y'know I can\xc2\x92t believe I even thought about getting back\ntogether again! We are so over!!"
Ross	 (starts to cry) FINE BY ME!! (he opens the door and traps Chandler behind\nit)'
Rachel	 Oh, oh, and hey-hey-hey, those little spelling tips will come in handy\nwhen you\xc2\x92re at home on Saturday nights playing Scrabble with Monica!!'
Monica	 Hey!!'
Rachel	 (to Monica) Sorry!! (to Ross) I just feel bad about all that sleep\nyou\xc2\x92re gonna miss wishing you were with me!'
Ross	 Oh, no-no-no don\xc2\x92t you worry about me falling asleep. I still have\nyour letter!!!'

Monica	 (sets down some cards) Gin.'
Chandler	 We were playing Gin? Y'know if we were a couple, we could play this\ngame naked."
Monica	 Will you stop!'
Chandler	 Okay. All right.'
Monica	 Okay, all right, I think you\xc2\x92re great, I think you\xc2\x92re sweet,\nand you\xc2\x92re smart, and I love you. But you will always be the guy who peed on me.'
