Mr. Treeger	 Ohhh, man!!'
Joey	 (coming in from his bedroom) What is that?'
Chandler	 Treeger\xc2\x92s snaking the shower drain.'
Mr. Treeger	 What in the name of hell?'
Joey	 Maybe he found you flip-flop.'
Chandler	 Hey!'
Joey	 Whoa! Is this porn? What did I do? I must\xc2\x92ve hit something on the\nremote.'
Chandler	 Do we pay for this?'
Joey	 No, we didn\xc2\x92t even pay our cable bill\xc2\x97maybe this is how they\npunish us.'
Chandler	 Maybe we shouldn\xc2\x92t pay our phone bill\xc2\x97free phone sex.'
Joey	 Maybe we shouldn\xc2\x92t pay our gas bill? (Stops and thinks about what he\njust said.)'
Mr. Treeger	 (coming in from the bathroom) Whoa, hey, that lady\xc2\x92s all kinds\nof naked.'
Chandler	 Yeah, Joey just pressed something on the remote and it just, came on!'
Mr. Treeger	 Yeah, it happened to me once. I was just flipping through the\nchannels and bam! It was like finding money.'
Chandler	 Like finding money with naked people on it!'
Mr. Treeger	 Then I made the mistake of turning off the TV, I never got it back\nagain. And I\xc2\x92m sad. (Exits.)'
Joey	 (to Chandler) Why would he turn off the TV? (Chandler shrugs.)'

Rachel	 All right, y\xc2\x92know what, come on, do we really have to watch this\nwhile we eat? (She makes a move for the remote.)'
Chandler	 We don\xc2\x92t know what could make this go away.'
Joey	 Yeah, so no one touches the remote. And no one touches the TV!'
Chandler	 And no one touches the air around the TV!'
Joey	 Imagine a protective porn bubble if you will, okay?'
Monica	 Well at least, I\xc2\x92m going to mute it.'
Chandler	 We still have porn.'
Joey	 Hey.'
Phoebe	 (entering, carrying her massage table) Hi!'
Monica	 Hi!'
Rachel	 Honey, what are you doing? That\xc2\x92s too heavy.'
Phoebe	 Yeah.'
Rachel	 Give it here. (She takes the table.) Oh, God. (And gives it to Monica\nright away.)'
Monica	 Okay.'
Phoebe	 Ohh, I\xc2\x92m getting too pregnant for this, lugging around a stupid\nmassage table. Y\xc2\x92know, I have to find a job where I carrying a smaller table. (She\ngoes over and stands in front of the TV.)'
Chandler	 Or a job where you don\xc2\x92t have to carry a table.'
Phoebe	 You mean like a doctor?'
Joey	 Pheebs! You\xc2\x92re blocking the porn! Look out!'
Phoebe	 Ohh! (She moves.) Oh my. Oh, that reminds me, I have to see my OB-GYN\ntoday.'
Ross	 Hi.'
Monica	 Hi.'
Ross	 So uh, Emily just went to the airport.'
Monica	 Oh. Why didn\xc2\x92t you take her?'
Ross	 Eh, her-her uncle already had planned on doing it. And y\xc2\x92know, we-we\nsaid our good-byes this morning, so\xc2\x85'
Monica	 You must feel horrible. Hey! The guys have free porn!'
Ross	 (Thinks about it.) Nah.'
Monica	 Hey, cheer up! You\xc2\x92re gonna see her again, right?'
Ross	 Well I, that\xc2\x92s the thing, I don\xc2\x92t know! I mean, whenever I\nbrought it up with her she said, (In a British accent.) "This is so fantastic! Why do\nwe have to talk about the future? Let\xc2\x92s just enjoy\xc2\x85"'
Monica	 (interrupting him) No-no-no, don\xc2\x92t-don\xc2\x92t do the accent.\nYou\xc2\x92ve got to see her again.'
Ross	 And why do you care so much?'
Monica	 Because! You could get to live out my fantasy!'
Ross	 You had fantasies about Emily?'
Monica	 No! Y\xc2\x92know, the fantasy! Meet someone from a strange land,\nfall in madly love, and spend the rest of your lives together.'
Ross	 Is that why in junior high you were the only one that hung out with that\nUkrainian kid?'
Monica	 Yeah that, plus his mom used to put sour cream on everything!'
Ross	 Ahh.'
Monica	 Do you love her?'
Ross	 We said it was only going to be two weeks, y\xc2\x92know?'
Monica	 You love her!'
Ross	 What-what is love really?'
Monica	 Ohhh, I knew you loved her! Then you need to go to the airport\nand tell her. You\xc2\x92re probably just gonna catch her just as she\xc2\x92s about to go to\nthe gate. You\xc2\x92re gonna call out her name and say, "I love you!" And\nshe\xc2\x92s gonna say, "I love you, too!" And you guys are going to have the most\namazing kiss, everyone at the gate will applaud.'
Ross	 I am a good kisser.'
Monica	 Then you two can, can sneak into the cockpit, and things will start to\nheat up, and then a stewardess comes in\xc2\x85 (Ross looks at her.) I\xc2\x92ve been watching\ntoo much porn.'
Rachel	 Is that the heartbeat?'
The Doctor	 That\xc2\x92s it.'
Phoebe	 Oh my God!'
Rachel	 Oh wow! This is so cool.'
The Doctor	 Have we talked about the possibility of multiple births?'
Phoebe	 Why don\xc2\x92t take care of this one, and should I get pregnant again,\nI\xc2\x92ll hold onto your card, okay?'
The Doctor	 No, I\xc2\x92m getting three separate heartbeats.'
Phoebe	 Three? You guys were worried I wouldn\xc2\x92t even have one!'
The Doctor	 Doctors are wrong all the time.'
Phoebe	 Well, yeah.'
Rachel	 Well, so, are-are you sure that there are three?!'
The Doctor	 Definitely. (Points out each head on the ultrasound.)'
Phoebe	 Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God!! So I-I mean so in a few months\nI\xc2\x92m going to have three full grown babies just walkin\xc2\x92 around inside me?! Oh!\nOh! And it\xc2\x92s gonna be one of those log rides where they just come shooting out!'
The Doctor	 Actually, giving birth to three babies isn\xc2\x92t that different\nfrom giving birth to one.'
Phoebe	 What do you know?!'
Alice	 (entering) Oh-oh, Phoebe!'
Phoebe	 Ooh! Hi!'
Alice	 Hi! (She runs over and hugs Phoebe\xc2\x92s stomach.) So, how did it go at\nthe doctors?'
Phoebe	 Oh well, okay, hey, y\xc2\x92know how when you\xc2\x92re umm, you\xc2\x92re\nwalking down the street and you see three people in a row, and you say, "Oh,\nthat\xc2\x92s nice?"'
Frank	 Yes.'
Phoebe	 Okay, yeah well, good news, you\xc2\x92re going to have three babies.'
Alice	 Three babies?'
Frank	 I finally got my band!'
Alice	 We\xc2\x92re gonna have a big family, I\xc2\x92ve always wanted a big family!'
Phoebe	 Oh God, I\xc2\x92m so glad you guys are happy, I was so afraid you were\ngoing to be all freaked.'
Frank	 Why would we be freaked?'
Phoebe	 No, no maybe \xc2\x91cause it\xc2\x92s harder to raise them, and the added\nexpense, and\xc2\x85'
Frank	 (They\xc2\x92re less than happy now) Oh.'
Alice	 Right.'
Phoebe	 No, back to happy. Back to happy!'
Alice	 No-no-no, no, it\xc2\x92s going to be fine. Because umm, because I teach\nHome Ec, and uh, I can have 30 kids making baby clothes all year long. Y\xc2\x92know\nit\xc2\x92ll-it\xc2\x92ll be like my very own little sweatshop. '
Frank	 Yeah, I\xc2\x92ve been thinking ever since you said we were having\ntriplets, the best thing for me to do is to drop out of college and get a job.'
Alice	 No, Frank.'
Phoebe	 No you can\xc2\x92t quit college! No! You\xc2\x92re in college? Really?'
Frank	 Yeah, refrigerator college.'
Alice	 Yeah.'
Frank	 Yeah, y\xc2\x92know when we found out we were going to have a baby,\ny\xc2\x92know I figured y\xc2\x92know like I should y\xc2\x92know have like a career\xc2\x97and I\nlove refrigerators!'
Phoebe	 You can\xc2\x92t give up on your dream.'
Frank	 No, it\xc2\x92s okay. We\xc2\x92re-we\xc2\x92re gonna have three kids! And\nthat\xc2\x92s-that\xc2\x92s a different kind of dream. Three kids and no money.'
Ross	 Emily! (Runs up.)'
Emily	 Oh my God! What are you doing here? (They hug)'
Ross	 I just, I had to see you one more time before you took-off.'
Emily	 You are so sweet. (They kiss.)'
Ross	 That\xc2\x92s, that\xc2\x92s, that\xc2\x92s a big candy bar. (She\xc2\x92s holding\none of those huge Toblerone bars.) I had the most amazing time with you.'
Emily	 Me too.'
Emily	 Well, that\xc2\x92 me. (They kiss again.) Here, have this. (She gives him\nthe candy bar.) I\xc2\x92m only allowed one piece of carryon anyway. (She starts towards the\njetway.)'
Ross	 (stops her) Wait uh, listen. I-I, I have to tell you something. Umm,\nI\xc2\x92ve been thinking, I\xc2\x92m just gonna come out and say it. Okay? I-I-I ah, I-I\nthink I love you.'
Emily	 Oh. (She\xc2\x92s shocked and hugs him.) Thank you. (She boards the plane.)'
Ross	 That\xc2\x92s no problem.'

Rachel	 What\xc2\x92s that song? It has been in my head all day long.'
Chandler	 It\xc2\x92s the theme from Good Will Humping.'
Rachel	 Y\xc2\x92know who doesn\xc2\x92t even like dirty movies? My new boyfriend\nJoshua.'
Joey	 Yeah right.'
Rachel	 No, he told me. He prefers to leave certain things to the imagination.'
Chandler	 Oh-oh, yeah, and did he also say that ah, some of the dialogue was\ncorny and that he actually found it was funny and not sexy?'
Rachel	 Yes!'
Joey	 Yeah, he likes porn.'
Monica	 Where ya going?'
Rachel	 I\xc2\x92m going to find out if he really thinks supermodels are too\nskinny. (As she exits, Phoebe enters.) Hey, Pheebs!'
Phoebe	 Hey.'
Joey	 Hey!'
Monica	 How did it go with Frank and Alice?'
Phoebe	 Well, Frank has to quit college because his super fertile sister is\nhaving three babies! I need to make a lot of money really fast, and I had an idea that I\nwant to talk to you (Points to Chandler) about, \xc2\x91cause you work for a big company.\nOkay, insider trading, what information is there that you can give me.'
Chandler	 They don\xc2\x92t really talk to us about that kind of stuff. I can get\nyou some free white out though.'
Monica	 Ohh! Did you do what I said? Did-did-did you tell her?'
Ross	 I did.'
Monica	 And well, what did she say?'
Ross	 Thank you.'
Monica	 Oh, you\xc2\x92re totally welcome! What\xc2\x92d she say?'
Ross	 She said, "Thank you." I said, "I love you." And she\nsaid, "Thank you."'
Chandler	 Whoa-whoa, wait a minute, did you say, you love her?'
Joey	 Yeah, what were you trying to get her to do?!'
Ross	 What do I do now?'
Joey	 You play hard to get.'
Ross	 She already lives in London.'
Joey	 Then you go to Tokyo.'
Chandler	 All right look, forget it, forget it. You told her you love her,\nit\xc2\x92s over.'
Monica	 It is not over! You\xc2\x92re over!'
Chandler	 What?'
Monica	 You know!'
Chandler	 Okay. (Pause) Good one.'
Monica	 It is not over because she is going to call you and tell you she loves\nyou. And the reason why she couldn\xc2\x92t, is because her feelings were so strong, it\nscared her. Now you go home and wait for her call, she could be calling you from the\nplane! Come on now go! Go! (Tries to push Ross out the door.)'
Ross	 Okay! Okay! But if she doesn\xc2\x92t call, it is definitely over! No, wait.\nWait. Unless, eventually, I call her, y\xc2\x92know just to she what\xc2\x92s going on, and,\nand she says she\xc2\x92ll call me back, but then she doesn\xc2\x92t. Then it\xc2\x92s\nover.'
Joey	 Way to be strong, man!'
Rachel	 Hey!'
Chandler	 Hi! Listen, can we watch cartoons on your television? We need a porn\nbreak. We spent the last two hours watching In & Out & In, Again.'
Rachel	 Well, so, why don\xc2\x92t you just turn it off?'
Chandler	 Because then we would be the guys who turned off free porn.'
Phoebe	 (entering carrying a case) Ooh, good, you\xc2\x92re hear! Okay.'
Monica	 Hey!'
Phoebe	 Hi!'
Rachel	 Well, what-what \xc2\x91cha got there?'
Phoebe	 Oh this, well I\xc2\x92m glad you asked. (She opens the case and removes a\nknife and an soda can.) Now, don\xc2\x92t you hate it when you have to cut a tin can with an\nordinary steak knife? (She efficiently cuts it in half.) Ahh! Now, I know what you\xc2\x92re\nthinking\xc2\x85'
Chandler	 Pregnant Woman Slays Four?'
Monica	 Phoebe, they didn\xc2\x92t make you pay for those knives, did they?'
Phoebe	 No!'
Monica	 Are you sure?'
Phoebe	 No!'
Rachel	 Honey, you\xc2\x92re not gonna make enough money to help Frank and Alice\njust by selling knives.'
Phoebe	 No-no, I know that, but I just have to make enough money for the second\npart of my plan.'
Chandler	 What\xc2\x92s the second part of your plan?'
Phoebe	 My Saturn dealership.'
Ross	 (Answers the phone.) Hello?'
Emily	 Ross.'
Ross	 Emily, hi! Uh, how-how was you flight?'
Emily	 It was dreadful. I felt terrible about how I acted when you said those\nwonderful things.'
Ross	 No, no, that-that, that\xc2\x92s all right. Umm, I\xc2\x92m just glad you\ncalled.'
Emily	 Ross umm, there\xc2\x92s something that I\xc2\x92ve got to tell you,\nthere\xc2\x92s-there\xc2\x92s someone else.'
Ross	 Does that mean the same thing in England as it does in America?'
Ross	 She doesn\xc2\x92t know which one of us she wants, me or this Colin guy.'
Monica	 This isn\xc2\x92t how it\xc2\x92s supposed to go, there can\xc2\x92t be\nanother guy.'
Ross	 Well\xc2\x85'
Monica	 Of course there\xc2\x92s another guy!! This is even more perfect! Now you\nhave to prove your love!'
Ross	 I\xc2\x92m not proving anything. Okay, I\xc2\x92m done listening to you. If I\nhadn\xc2\x92t let you talk me into going to the airport in the first place, I never\nwould\xc2\x92ve put my fist through the wall!'
Chandler	 You put your fist through the wall?'
Ross	 No, I missed and hit the door. But, it opened really hard!'
Monica	 You have to go to London!'
Ross	 What?'
Monica	 Yeah, you have to go fight for her!'
Joey	 Oh yeah, sure, that makes sense. Yeah. \xc2\x91Cause you already told her\nyou love her and she didn\xc2\x92t say it back, then she called you and told you that\nthere\xc2\x92s another guy, so yeah, go to London that\xc2\x92ll scare her!'
Monica	 When Rachel was with Paulo, what did you do?'
Ross	 I made fun of his accent.'
Monica	 You sat back and let him have her, you didn\xc2\x92t fight at all. Am I\nright? Do you want the same thing to happen with Emily?'
Ross	 No.'
Monica	 All right then, go fight for her! Go to London! I mean, that could be\nyou and Emily! (Points to the TV.) That, but-but nicer. Just, go to London!'
Ross	 Really?'
Monica	 Come on! Surprise her! Show up at her doorstep! Don\xc2\x92t let her go\nwithout a fight!'
Ross	 All right. All right, I\xc2\x92m gonna do it! '
Monica	 All right.'
Ross	 I\xc2\x92m gonna, I\xc2\x92m gonna go to London and I\xc2\x92m going to fight\nfor her.'
Monica	 Okay, good luck!'
Joey	 Ross! Ross! If you\xc2\x92re going to the airport, could you pick me up\nanother one of those Toblerone bars? (Chandler nods his head no.)'
Rachel	 Hey!'
Phoebe	 Ooh-Ooh! I did it! I did it! I figured out a way to make money! I\xc2\x92m\ngonna open up my own massage place and Frank\xc2\x92s gonna help me! And! We can work it\naround his schedule so he doesn\xc2\x92t have to quit school!'
Monica	 That\xc2\x92s sounds great, but how are you going to afford it?'
Rachel	 Well, we were walking down the street and we saw that van that you guys\nused for catering and we realised\xc2\x85'
Phoebe	 I\xc2\x92m telling it! I\xc2\x92m telling it!'
Rachel	 Okay.'
Phoebe	 Okay. You know how people need transportation, but they also need\nmassages to help them relax so I just figured we could combine the two, okay, I give the\nmassages and Frank drives! I can fix up the van, bolt the table in the back, and you know\nwhat I\xc2\x92ve got?'
Chandler	 A place where no one will ever get out alive?'
Phoebe	 No! Think about it, it\xc2\x92s a taxi that people take when they need to\nrelax, it\xc2\x92s\xc2\x85'
Rachel	 (interrupting) Relaxi-Taxi!'
Phoebe	 The name was my favourite part!'
Rachel	 Well, well I can up with it!'
Phoebe	 YOU DID NOT!!!! Oh! No! You came up with Relaxi Cab! That\xc2\x92s\nnot good.'
Rachel	 Well, I\xc2\x85'
Monica	 Hello.'
Ross	 (on phone) Hey.'
Monica	 Oh my God! Ross, are you in England? Was Emily surprised?'
Ross	 No, because she hasn\xc2\x92t come home yet. And she hasn\xc2\x92t been home\nall night! She\xc2\x92s obviously staying with that other guy, and I\xc2\x92m the stupid moron\nwho spent the whole night outside her apartment!'
Monica	 All right. When is, when is the next flight out?'
Ross	 About four hours.'
Monica	 Okay, just stay there a couple more hours and if she doesn\xc2\x92t show\nup by then, then just come on home.'
Phoebe	 Hey, tell him about Relaxi-Taxi, and-and ask him if he thinks\nthat\xc2\x92s better than Relaxi Cab.'
Rachel	 Okay, it\xc2\x92s not Relaxi Cab. It\xc2\x92s Relaxicab, like taxicab. '
Phoebe	 Oh, that is better.'
Chandler	 Are we in London?'
Monica	 What are you doing here? You can\xc2\x92t be here!'
Emily	 I\xc2\x92ve uh, I\xc2\x92ve come to talk to Ross.'
Emily	 What?'
Joey	 (pause) Nothing. No, nothing.'
Emily	 I was going to call him, but\xc2\x85'
Monica	 Oh, you came to tell him you love him! I knew it! (Points at Chandler) I\nwas right! (Points to Emily) I\xc2\x92m right, right?'
Emily	 I\xc2\x92d really rather talk to him. '
Monica	 Oh.'
Emily	 I uh, I\xc2\x92ve been to his apartment and he wasn\xc2\x92t there, and uh. I\nneed to talk to him, so do you have any idea where he is?'

Emily	 Ross, are you there? Ross, I don\xc2\x92t know if you can hear this\nbut\xc2\x85 (Ross has moved to the window, apparently so that he can hear better.) I\xc2\x92m\ngonna talk anyway, uh, I\xc2\x92m in the States with you sister and your friends and\nit\xc2\x92s all over with Colin. I came here to tell you that, and to tell you\xc2\x97Yes,\nJoey you can have all the chocolate you want, just take it! Uh, I came here to tell you\nthat I love you.'
Ross	 (yelling, thinking Emily can hear him through the answering machine all\nthe way to New York.) I love you too! I\xc2\x92m, I\xc2\x92m gonna call you right now from the\nphone booth! (Realises) You can\xc2\x92t hear me. (Goes to make his call.)'
Emily	 I wish I could know if you\xc2\x92d heard any of that. I suppose I\xc2\x92ve\neither just told you I love you or given my neighbours a good laugh. Mrs. Newman if\nyou\xc2\x92re listening, bugger off this in none of your business. I suppose there\xc2\x92s\nnot much chance you did heard that, and there\xc2\x92s the call waiting so, I should go. Oh\nwell. (Answers the call waiting.) Hello.'
Ross	 Hi.'
Emily	 Ross, I love you!'
Ross	 Ohh! Thank you.'

Chandler	 Hey.'
Joey	 Hey.'
Chandler	 I was just at the bank, and there was this really hot teller, and she\ndidn\xc2\x92t ask me to go do it with her in the vault.'
Joey	 Same kind of thing happened to me! Woman pizza delivery guy come over,\ngives me the pizza, takes the money, and leaves!'
Chandler	 What, no, "Nice apartment, I bet the bedrooms are huge?"'
Joey	 Noo! Nothing!'
Chandler	 Y\xc2\x92know what, we have to turn off the porn.'
Joey	 I think you\xc2\x92re right.'
Chandler	 All right, ready?'
Joey	 One.'
Chandler	 Two.'
Joey	 That\xc2\x92s kinda nice.'
Chandler	 Yeah, that\xc2\x92s kinda a relief.'
Joey	 Yeah.'
Chandler	 You wanna see if we still have it?'
Joey	 Yeah.'
Chandler	 FREE PORN!!!'
Joey	 Yeah!!'
Chandler	 We have free porn here!!!'
