Joey	 Okay, pick a card, any card. (Monica picks one) All right, now memorize\nit. Show to everybody. Got it?'
Monica	 Um-mm.'
Joey	 All right, give it back to me. (takes the card back, but he looks at the\ncard before he puts it back in the deck, he holds the deck to his forehead, and thinks a\nlittle while) 5 of hearts.'
Ross	 Real magic does exist.'
Rachel	 Wow.'
Monica	 Wow. Joey, (sarcastically) how do you do it?'
Joey	 I can\xc2\x92t tell you that, no.'
Ross	 Ah, somebody\xc2\x92s at the door on the ceiling.'
Rachel	 Noo, that\xc2\x92s our unbelievably loud upstairs neighbor.'
Monica	 He took up the carpet, and now you can hear everything.'
Phoebe	 Why don\xc2\x92t you go up there and ask him to \xc2\x91step lightly,\nplease?\xc2\x92'
Monica	 I have like five times, but the guy is so charming, that I go up there\nto yell and then I end up apologizing to him.'
Phoebe	 Ooh, that is silly. (gets up) I\xc2\x92ll go up there, I\xc2\x92ll tell him\nto keep it down.'
Monica	 All right, be my guest.'
Rachel	 Good luck.'
Joey	 All right, all right, all right, all right, all right, you really wanna\nknow how I did it, I\xc2\x92ll show ya. When you handed me back the card, what you\ndidn\xc2\x92t see was, I looked at it so fast that it was invisible to the naked eye. (picks\nup a card and quickly looks at it) I just did it. (does it again) I just did it, again.\nHere, I\xc2\x92ll slow it down so that you guys can see it. (looks and the card in slow\nmotion)'
All	 Oh, I got it.'
Phoebe	 (muffled through the floor) Yeah, look I was with my friend downstairs\nand we hear everything up here that you do, and I am sick and tired... (I tired but the\nrest is unintelligible).'
Guy	 (muffled) Whoa, you are very beautiful.'
Phoebe	 (muffled) Oh, thank you.'

Chandler	 (entering) Hey, anybody got a length of rope about six feet long with\na little nouse at the end?'
Monica	 Honey, what\xc2\x92s the matter?'
Chandler	 I just saw Janice. '
All	 Oh.'
Chandler	 Yeah, she was at Rockefeller Center skating with her husband, she\nlooked so happy. I almost feel bad for whipping that kid\xc2\x92s pretzel at them.'
Joey	 Man, I remember the first time I saw that girl Katherine, after we broke\nup. She was just walking with her friend Donna, just laughing and talking. God, it killed\nme.'
Chandler	 Yes, but you ended up having sex with both of them that afternoon.'
Joey	 Sorry, I just, any excuse to tell that story y'know...."
Ross	 Hey Chandler, there\xc2\x92s a party tomorrow, you\xc2\x92ll feel better then.'
Chandler	 Oh, y'know what, I\xc2\x92m gonna be okay, you don\xc2\x92t have to throw\na party for me."
Monica	 It\xc2\x92s Joey\xc2\x92s birthday.'
Chandler	 Oh, well then, if anybody should have a party it should be him.'
Monica	 Sush!! I cannot believe she is still up there.'
Chandler	 Okay, well he totally screwed up the punch line. Y'know, it\xc2\x92s\nsupposed to be arrghh-eh og-errigh."
Mr. Kaplan	 (entering) How\xc2\x92s that coffee comin,\xc2\x92 dear?'
Rachel	 (jumping up from reading her magazine) Yeah, right away Mr. Kaplan.'
Mr. Kaplan	 I\xc2\x92m not supposed to drink coffee, it makes me gassy.'
Rachel	 I know!'
Mr. Kaplan	 I\xc2\x92ll bet your thinking, \xc2\x91What\xc2\x92s an intelligent girl\nwho wants to be in fashion, doing making coffee?\xc2\x92 Eh?'
Rachel	 Op.'
Mr. Kaplan	 Eh.'
Rachel	 Oh, you got me.'
Mr. Kaplan	 Well, don\xc2\x92t think I haven\xc2\x92t noticed your potential. Well,\nI\xc2\x92ve got a project for you that\xc2\x92s a lot more related to fashion. How does that\nsound?'
Rachel	 Oh, that sounds great.'
Mr. Kaplan	 Come on over here, sweetheart. (they walk over to a storage closet)'
Rachel	 Oh thank you so much Mr. Kaplan, thank you so much.'
Mr. Kaplan	 (opening the closet door revealing that it\xc2\x92s full of tangled up\nhangers.) I need these hangers separated ASAP. (she is stunned) You\xc2\x92re welcome.'
Rachel	 Oh God, I hate my job, I hate it, I hate my job, I hate it.'
Monica	 I know honey, I\xc2\x92m sorry.'
Rachel	 Oh, I wanna quit, but then I think I should stick it out, then I think\nwhy would such a person stay in such a demeaning job, just because it\xc2\x92s remotely\nrelated to the field they\xc2\x92re interested in.'
Monica	 (gives her a look) Gee, I don\xc2\x92t know Rach. Order up!! I got a\nYentel soup, a James Beans, and a Howdy hold the Dowdy!'
Rachel	 Oh honey, come on, I\xc2\x92m sorry, I didn\xc2\x92t.... I don\xc2\x92t mind\npaying my dues, y'know, its just how much am I gonna learn about fashion by walking Mira,\nthe arthritic seamstress, to the bathroom."
Rachel	 (to him) Hi! Is my misery amusing to you?'
Guy	 I\xc2\x92m sorry, I wa, I wa, I was just ah.... (starts to laugh again)'
Rachel	 It\xc2\x92s not funny, this is actually my job.'
Guy	 Oh believe me, I-I-I\xc2\x92ve been there. I had to sort mannequin heads at\nthat Mannequins Plus.'
Rachel	 Oh well then, so I\xc2\x92m just going to go back to talking to my friend\nhere. And you can go back to enjoying your little hamburger.'
Guy	 Ah, just one other thing.'
Rachel	 Yes?!'
Guy	 I ah, I work at Bloomingdale\xc2\x92s and I might know of a job\npossibility if your, if your interested?'
Rachel	 (looks at Monica) (to him) Do you want my pickle?'
Gunther	 (to Monica and Phoebe) Hey guys.'
Monica	 Hey Gunther. Hi. (to Phoebe) I mean you\xc2\x92re going out on a date with\nthe noisy guy upstairs?'
Phoebe	 Well, he\xc2\x92s very charming.'
Monica	 I know, he\xc2\x92s too charming, but if you two start going out, then\nit\xc2\x92s just gonna make it so much harder for me to hate him.'
Phoebe	 Well, you\xc2\x92re just gonna have to try.'
Monica	 Joey, where are the Jell-o shots?'
Joey	 I don\xc2\x92t know, Chandler is supposed to be passin\xc2\x92 \xc2\x91em\naround...'
Joey	 Chandler!'
Chandler	 Hello-dillillio!!'
Ross	 Oh, somebody\xc2\x92s feeling better.'
Monica	 (to Chandler) Stick out your tongue.'
Chandler	 (to Monica) Take off your shirt!'
Monica	 Oh my!!'
Joey	 Oh my God! How many of these things did you have? These are pure vodka.'
Chandler	 Yeah, Jell-o just like Mom used to make.'
Rachel	 (entering, to Ross) The most unbelievable thing happened to me today.'
Ross	 Hi!'
Rachel	 Hi! So I\xc2\x92m out having lunch at Monica\xc2\x92s and this guy starts\ntalking to me, and it turns out he works for a buyer at Bloomingdale\xc2\x92s and\nthere happens to be an opening in his department. So I gave him my phone number and\nhe\xc2\x92s gonna call me this weekend to see if he can get me an interview!'
Ross	 Wow!'
Rachel	 I know!'
Ross	 What, so this guy is helping you for no apparent reason?'
Rachel	 Uh-huh!'
Ross	 And he\xc2\x92s, he\xc2\x92s a total stranger?'
Rachel	 Yeah! His name is um, Mark something.'
Ross	 Huh. Sounds like Mark Something wants to have some sex.'
Rachel	 What!?'
Ross	 Well, I\xc2\x92m just saying, I mean why else would he just, y'know, swoop\nin out of nowhere for no reason."
Rachel	 To be nice.'
Ross	 Hey, Joey. Are men ever nice to strange women for no reason?'
Joey	 No, only for sex.'
Ross	 Thank you. (to Rachel) So did you ah, did you tell Mark Something about\nme?'
Rachel	 I didn\xc2\x92t have to, because I was wearing my \xc2\x91I heart Ross\xc2\x92\nsandwich board and ringing my bell.'
Ross	 Uh-huh.'
Joey\xc2\x92s Sisters	 (entering) Joey!!! Happy Birthday!! (all 7 of them look\nalmost identical)'
Joey	 Hey!! Hey-hey-hey!'
Chandler	 (to Monica) Okay, how many of that girl are you seeing?'
Monica	 How hammered are you? Huh? These, these are Joey\xc2\x92s sisters.'
Chandler	 Hi Joey\xc2\x92s sisters!'
Phoebe	 (to one of his sisters, Cookie) Hey!'
Cookie	 Hey. What are we drinkin\xc2\x92 over here.'
Phoebe	 Well, I have ah, vodka and cranberry juice.'
Cookie	 No kiddin,\xc2\x92 that\xc2\x92s the exact same drink I made myself right\nafter I shot my husband.'
Phoebe	 Wow. Okay, I don\xc2\x92t know how to talk to you.'
Sister 1	 (to Chandler) What \xc2\x91cha doing?'
Chandler	 Oh, I\xc2\x92m taking my ex-girlfriend of my speed dialer.'
Joey\xc2\x92s Sisters	 Oh!!'
Chandler	 No-no-no-no, no, it\xc2\x92s a good thing. Why must we dial so speedily\nanyway? Why must we rush through life? Why can\xc2\x92t we savor the precious moments? (to\none of Joey\xc2\x92s sisters) Those are some huge breasts you have.'
Ross	 Hi.'
Monica	 Hi.'
Ross	 Yeah. So um, I-I heard about this ah, Mark guy that ah, Rachel met today.'
Monica	 Isn\xc2\x92t that great?'
Ross	 Oh yeah! So ah, kinda pretty, pretty good. He sounds like a nice, good\nguy.'
Monica	 Oh, he is. And he is so dreamy. I mean, y'know what, when he left I\nactually used the phrase, \xc2\x91Hummina-hummina-hummina.\xc2\x92 (walks away)"
Ross	 That\xc2\x92s excellent.'
Ross	 (to Rachel) So, he\xc2\x92s just a nice guy. You really think this Mark\ndoesn\xc2\x92t want anything in exchange for helping him?'
Rachel	 Well, I assume I\xc2\x92ll have to take showers with him, but y'know,\nthat\xc2\x92s true of any job."
Monica	 How ya feelin\xc2\x92?'
Chandler	 Well, my apartment isn\xc2\x92t there anymore, because I drank it.'
Phoebe	 Where\xc2\x92d you get too? We lost you after you opened up all the\npresents.'
Ross	 Yeah.'
Chandler	 Yeah, I ended up in the storage room, and not alone.'
All	 Woooo hoooo!!!'
Chandler	 Ow, no \xc2\x91woo-hooing,\xc2\x92 no \xc2\x91woo-hooing.\xc2\x92 '
Phoebe	 Why, what happened?'
Chandler	 Ah, I fooled around with Joey\xc2\x92s sister. (Phoebe gasps) Well,\nthat\xc2\x92s not the worst part. '
Monica	 What is the worse part?'
Chandler	 I can\xc2\x92t remember which sister.'
Ross	 (to Rachel) You see what men do! Don\xc2\x92t tell me men are not nice!\n(points to Chandler) This is men!!'

Monica	 Are you insane? I mean Joey, is going to kill you, he\xc2\x92s actually\ngoing to kill you dead.'
Chandler	 Okay! You don\xc2\x92t think I thought of that?'
Phoebe	 How can you not know which one?'
Rachel	 I mean that\xc2\x92s unbelievable.'
Monica	 I mean, was it Gina?'
Ross	 Which one is Gina?'
Rachel	 Dark, big hair, with the airplane earrings.'
Monica	 No, no, no, that\xc2\x92s Dina.'
Chandler	 (to Monica) You see you can\xc2\x92t tell which one is which either,\ndwha!!'
Phoebe	 We didn\xc2\x92t fool around with any of them. Dwha! Dwha!'
Chandler	 Veronica. Look, it\xc2\x92s got to be Veronica, the girl in the red\nskirt. I definitely stuck my tongue down her throat.'
Monica	 That was me.'
Chandler	 Look, when I\xc2\x92ve been drinking, sometimes I tend to get overly\nfriendly, and I\xc2\x92m sorry.'
Monica	 That\xc2\x92s okay.'
Rachel	 That\xc2\x92s all right.'
Ross	 That\xc2\x92s okay.'
Joey	 (angrily entering, to Chandler) Can I talk to you for a second?!'
Ross	 Hey, Joey.'
Rachel	 Hey. (they all walk away from Chandler)'
Joey	 Come on!! (motions for Chandler to come with him)'
Chandler	 Why can\xc2\x92t we talk in here? With, with, witnesses.'
Joey	 I just got off the phone with my sister.'
Ross	 Ah, which, which one?'
Joey	 Mary-Angela.'
Ross	 Mary-Angela.'
Joey	 Yeah.'
Monica	 Y'know which one was she again?"
Joey	 Why don\xc2\x92t you ask Chandler, \xc2\x91cause he\xc2\x92s the one that fooled\naround with her. She told me you said you could really fall for her. Now is that\ntrue? Or are you just gettin\xc2\x92 over Janice by groping my sister. '
Chandler	 It\xc2\x92s gotta be the first one.'
Joey	 Really? That\xc2\x92s great! You and my sister, sittin\xc2\x92 in a tree.'
Chandler	 Yep, I\xc2\x92m in a tree.'
Rachel	 Did he call? Did Mark call?'
Monica	 No honey, I\xc2\x92m sorry, but the weekend\xc2\x92s not over yet.'
Rachel	 Oh. (we hear laughing from the upstairs apartment) Oh my God, is that\nPhoebe?'
Monica	 I guess they\xc2\x92re back from their date.'
Rachel	 Music. Very nice.'
Monica	 Oh my God!'
Rachel	 So, how are you?'
Monica	 I am good. I finished my book.'
Rachel	 Oh yeah, what\xc2\x92s it about?'
Monica	 I don\xc2\x92t remember. Do you wanna take a walk?'
Rachel	 Yeah, I do. (they both run out)'
Ross	 Dear Mary-Angela. Hi. How\xc2\x92s it going. This is the hardest letter\nI\xc2\x92ve ever had to write. (to Chandler) What the hell\xc2\x92s a matter with you? How do\nyou think Joey\xc2\x92s going to react when he finds out that you blew off his sister with a\nletter?'
Chandler	 Well, that\xc2\x92s the part where you tell him that I moved to France.\nWhen actually I\xc2\x92ll be in Cuba.'
Ross	 All right, look, look, you\xc2\x92ve got to do this yourself, okay in\nperson. At least you know her name. You just go to the house and you ask for Mary-Angela,\nokay, when which ever one she is comes to the door, you take her for a walk, you let her\ndown easy.'
Chandler	 What if Mary-Angela comes to the door and I ask for Mary-Angela?'
Ross	 Where in Cuba?'
Chandler	 (shocked) Joey, what-wh-wh-wha-wh-wha-wh-wha-wh-wha-what are you doing\nhere?'
Joey	 Waiting for my Grandma to finish my laundry. What about you?'
Chandler	 I\xc2\x92m here to see Mary-Angela.'
Joey	 You are so the man! (motions him to come in, and he does) Now look,\nlisten, listen, you got to be cool, \xc2\x91cause my Grandma doesn\xc2\x92t know about you two\nyet, and you do not want to tick her off. She was like the sixth person to spit on\nMussolini's hanging body. Yeah."
Chandler	 Where\xc2\x92s Mary-Angela?'
Joey	 She\xc2\x92s right in there. (motions to the living room)'
Joey\xc2\x92s Sisters	 Hey, Chandler!'
Rachel	 I can\xc2\x92t believe Mark didn\xc2\x92t call. It\xc2\x92s Sunday night, and\nhe didn\xc2\x92t call.'
Ross	 Bummer.'
Rachel	 (to Ross) Yeah, right. Look at you, you\xc2\x92re practically giddy.'
Ross	 No, I\xc2\x92m genuinely sorry the Mark thing didn\xc2\x92t work out. Look,\nRach, I want only good things for you.'
Monica	 Wait a minute, why don\xc2\x92t you just call Mark. (they both look up in\nshock) I mean, who says you have to sit here and wait for him, you\xc2\x92ve got to make\nstuff happen.'
Ross	 But, you, you don\xc2\x92t want to seem too pushy.'
Monica	 (to Ross) Honey, it\xc2\x92s not pushy, he gave her his home number.'
Ross	 (to Rachel, as she gets his number) What, he gave you his home number? As\nin like, to, to his home?'
Rachel	 Yeah, and you don\xc2\x92t mind if I call, because you only want good\nthings for me.'
Ross	 That\xc2\x92s right good things, that-that is what I said. (glances at\nMonica)'
Rachel	 (on phone) Hello, Mark? Hi, it\xc2\x92s Rachel Green. (listens) Oh no,\ndon\xc2\x92t you apologize. (listens) Yeah, I\xc2\x92ll hold. (to Monica and Ross) He left my\nnumber at work, but he was helping his niece with her report on the pioneers.'
Ross	 That is so made up!'
Rachel	 (on phone) Yeah, oh my God, tomorrow! That, no, it\xc2\x92s perfect. Oh\nGod, thank you soo much. Great! Bye! (hangs up phone) I got the interview!'
Monica	 Yay!'
Ross	 There you go.'
Rachel	 He even offered to meet me for lunch tomorrow to prep me for it.'
Monica	 Oh, that is amazing!'
Ross	 Yeah well, if I know Mark, and I think I do, I\xc2\x92d expect nothing less.'
Rachel	 I got to figure out what I\xc2\x92m going to wear.'
Ross	 High collar and baggy pants say I\xc2\x92m a pro.'
Rachel	 Yeah! Right! Okay, I\xc2\x92ll see you guys later. (starts to leave) Woo\nhoo!'
Ross	 You go get \xc2\x91em. (to Monica) What did I do to you? Did I hurt you in\nsome way?'
Monica	 What?'
Ross	 \xc2\x91Why don\xc2\x92t you call him?!\xc2\x92 Well, thank you very much!\nY'know now he is going to prep her, y'know prep her, as in what you do when you surgically\nremove the boyfriend!"
Monica	 Are you crazy?!'
Ross	 Am I! Am I! Am I out of my mind! Am I losing my senses!! This dreamy guy\nis taking my girlfriend out for a meal.'
Monica	 What?! Ross y'know this isn\xc2\x92t even about you! I mean this is about\nRachel and something wonderful happening for her. I mean you know even if you\xc2\x92re\nright, what if he wants to sleep with her, does it mean he gets too?"
Ross	 No.'
Monica	 I mean don\xc2\x92t you trust her?'
Ross	 Well, yeah!'
Monica	 Then get over yourself! Grow up!'
Ross	 (shyly) You grow up.'
Chandler	 This teramisu is, is excellent. Did you make it Mary-Angela?'
Joey\xc2\x92s Grandmother	 No! I did!'
Chandler	 Well, it\xc2\x92s, it\xc2\x92s yummy. So Mary-Angela do you like it?'
Joey\xc2\x92s Grandmother	 Of course! It\xc2\x92s her favorite.'
Chandler	 So um, Mary-Angela, what\xc2\x92s your second favorite?'
Joey\xc2\x92s Grandmother	 More of Grandma\xc2\x92s teramisu.'
Chandler	 Would you just please....give me the receipt \xc2\x91cause this is\ngreat. It\xc2\x92s top notch.'
Joey\xc2\x92s Grandmother	 That dies with me.'
Chandler	 So will I.'
Joey\xc2\x92s Sister	 Excuse yourself, and go to the bathroom.'
Chandler	 Oh no-no-no I was just squinting. That doesn\xc2\x92t mean anything.'
Joey\xc2\x92s Sister	 (whispering in his ear) Just do it.'
Chandler	 Will you excuse me I have to um..... (walks to the hall)'
Chandler	 (startled) Hey!'
Joey\xc2\x92s Sister	 Finally, I thought we\xc2\x92d never be alone. Can I just tell\nyou something, I have not stopped thinking about you since the party. (kisses him)'
Chandler	 Look, I may have jumped the gun here. (she tries to kiss him, but he\nducks it and moves away) Um, I just got out of a relationship and I\xc2\x92m not really in\na, in a commitment kind of place.'
Joey\xc2\x92s Sister	 So! Me neither! God, Mary-Angela was right you do have the\nsoftest lips.'
Chandler	 Ahhhh, you\xc2\x92re not Mary-Angela.'
Joey\xc2\x92s Sister	 No, I\xc2\x92m Mary-Theresa.'
Chandler	 This is so bad. If-if you\xc2\x92re not Mary-Angela, then-then who is?'
Mary-Angela	 (standing behind Chandler) I am!'
Chandler	 Oh, this is soo bad. (doesn\xc2\x92t see Mary-Angela)'
Mary-Angela	 Joey!!!'
Chandler	 No Joey! No Joey! Don\xc2\x92t Joey! Joey!'
Joey	 What\xc2\x92s goin\xc2\x92 on?'
Chandler	 (pats him on the shoulder) You\xc2\x92re it! Now run and hide!'
Mary-Theresa	 It\xc2\x92s no big deal. Chandler was just kissin\xc2\x92 me because\nhe thought I was Mary-Angela.'
Joey	 What?! How could you do that, how could you think she was Mary-Angela?'
Chandler	 I wasn\xc2\x92t sure which one Mary-Angela was. (all of Joey\xc2\x92s\nsisters gasp) Look, I\xc2\x92m sorry okay, I was really drunk, and you all look really\nsimilar.'
Joey\xc2\x92s Sister	 I say, punch him Joey.'
All	 Yeah! Punch him!!'
Chandler	 Y'know what, we should all calm down because your brother\xc2\x92s not\ngoing to punch me. (to Joey) Are ya?"
Joey	 Well, that is usually what I would do. But I just never thought you\xc2\x92d\nbe on the receiving end of it. How could you do this?!'
Chandler	 Joey if you wanna punch me, go ahead, I deserve it. But I just want\nyou to know that I would never soberly hurt you or your family, you\xc2\x92re my best\nfriend. I would never do anything like this ever again.'
Cookie	 So what. I say, punch him.'
All	 Yeah! Punch him! Punch him!'
Joey	 No! No! No! No, I\xc2\x92m not going to punch Chandler.'
Cookie	 I\xc2\x92ll do it.'
Joey	 No you won\xc2\x92t. Look he knows he did a terrible thing and I believe\nhim, he\xc2\x92s sorry. But, (to Chandler) you\xc2\x92ve got one more apology to make, all\nright, you\xc2\x92ve got to apologize to Mary-Angela.'
Chandler	 Okay, absolutely!'
Joey	 All right.'
Chandler	 You\xc2\x92ve got it. (he starts to look at his sister\xc2\x92s, but he\nstill doesn\xc2\x92t know which one is Mary-Angela.)'
Joey	 Cookie, now you can punch him!'
Chandler	 What?! (Cookie punches him)'
Rachel	 (getting of the elevator and noticing Ross) Hey!'
Ross	 Hi!'
Rachel	 What are you doing here?'
Ross	 Ah y'know, this building is on my paper route so I... (gives her a flower)\n"
Rachel	 Oh.'
Ross	 Hi. (kisses her)'
Rachel	 Hi.'
Ross	 How\xc2\x92d did it go?'
Rachel	 Oh well, the woman I interviewed with was pretty tough, but y'know thank\nGod Mark coached me, because once I started talking about the fall line, she got all happy\nand wouldn\xc2\x92t shut up."
Ross	 I\xc2\x92m so proud of you.'
Rachel	 Me too!'
Ross	 Listen, I\xc2\x92m ah, I\xc2\x92m sorry I\xc2\x92ve been so crazy and jealous\nand, it\xc2\x92s just that I like you a lot, so...'
Rachel	 I know.'
Ross	 Yeah.'
Rachel	 Yeah.'
Mark	 Rachel?'
Rachel	 Yeah. (turns around) Hi Mark!'
Mark	 Hi. I just talked to Joanna, and she loves you. You got it, you got the\njob.'
Rachel	 Oh, I did!'
Mark	 Yes.'
Rachel	 (to Ross) Oh my God!! (she turns around and hugs Mark, not Ross)'
Ross	 Congratu!! (sees her hug Mark) -lations-lations.'

Monica	 So ah, Phoebe, how was your date?'
Phoebe	 Oh well y'know. (laughs)"
Monica	 Yeah, I do know.'
Phoebe	 Ick, you were eavesdropping.'
Rachel	 Eavesdropping. Pheebs, the ceiling tiles were falling down.'
Phoebe	 Oh, I\xc2\x92m sorry. But I really like this guy. And I think he really\nhappens to like me.'
Ross	 Maybe he\xc2\x92s just jumping on a pogo-stick and really likes it?'
Ross	 Maybe the pogo-stick likes it too?'
Joey	 All right, that\xc2\x92s it! He cannot do this to Phoebe. (gets up) This guy\nis going to get the butt kicking of a lifetime! (stops and turns around and asks Rachel)\nBut, is he a big guy?'
Ross	 Ah, we\xc2\x92ll all go. (motions to Chandler) Come on. (the guys leave)'
Phoebe	 Thanks you guys! Thank you.'
Chandler	 Don\xc2\x92t worry.'
Phoebe	 God, I hope they kick his ass!'
Rachel	 Honey, I\xc2\x92m sorry.'
Monica	 Y'know if it\xc2\x92s any consolation, he really did sound like he was\nhaving more fun with you. (Rachel nods in agreement)"
Guy	 (muffled) May I help you?'
