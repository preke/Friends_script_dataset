Jennifer Aniston (V.O.)	 Previously on Friends.'
Monica	 Erica, are you okay?'
Erica	 Yeah, you know, maybe I ate too much. I keep getting these \n  stomach-aches. They come and go like every few minutes.'
Monica	 Oh my God!'
Chandler	 Relax! We'll just get her some antacids."
Monica	 She doesn't have a stomach-ache. She's in labor!"
Chandler	 Oh my God!'
Rachel	 So if you think I didn't say goodbye to you because you don't \n  mean as much to me as everybody else, you're wrong. It's because you \n  mean more to me."
Ross	 Rach!'
Rachel	 What?!'
Ross	 Hey.'
Rachel	 Shh.. Go back to sleep. I have to go home.'
Ross	 Oh. This was amazing.'
Rachel	 It really was. You've learned some new moves!"
Ross	 Yeah, well, this guy at work gave me "Sex for Dummies" as a \n  joke.'
Rachel	 Ah.'
Ross	 Who's laughing now?"
Rachel	 I know!'

Monica	 Breathe, breathe, breathe... Good.'
Chandler	 Next time, can I say breathe?'
Monica	 No, last time you said it like Dracula, and it scared her! Can \n  I get you anything? You want some more ice chips?'
Erica	 No, I'm okay."
Monica	 Alright, I'll be right back."
Chandler	 Where are you going?'
Monica	 To use the bathroom.'
Chandler	 You can't leave me alone with her."
Monica	 What?'
Chandler	 This is exactly the kind of social situation that I am not \n  comfortable with!'
Monica	 What kind of social situation are you comfortable with?'
Chandler	 It's just that we've never spent any time, you know, alone \n  together."
Monica	 You'll be fine. Nah, you won't, but I'll be back in two \n  minutes."
Chandler	 Okay.'
Chandler	 So, ah... Any plans for the summer?'
Erica	 I don't know. Maybe church-camp?"
Chandler	 Hah. May not wanna mention this. So, you ever wonder which \n  is worse, you know; going through labor or getting kicked in the nuts?'
Erica	 What?'
Chandler	 Well, it's just interesting. You know, because no one will \n  ever know, because no one can experience both."
Chandler	 One of life's great, unanswerable questions. I mean, who \n  knows? Maybe there's something even more painful than those things? \nLike this."
Phoebe	 Morning.'
Joey	 Hey!'
Phoebe	 What's that?"
Joey	 It's my house-warming present for Monica and Chandler."
Phoebe	 It's a baby chick and duck!"
Joey	 Uh-huh. And I named them Chick Jr. and Duck Jr.'
Phoebe	 I did not see that coming.'
Joey	 Yeah, I figure they'll love it at the new house, you know? It \n  has that big backyard. And then, when they get old, they can go to \n  that special farm that Chandler took the other chick and duck to."
Phoebe	 Yes.'
Joey	 Yeah. It's a shame people can't visit there."
Phoebe	 That is the rule, though.'
Phoebe	 Guess what? You're almost an uncle!"
Ross	 What?'
Joey	 Yeah, Erica went into labor last night. Monica and Chandler are \n  at the hospital right now!'
Ross	 Oh my God!'
Phoebe	 Yeah, and I have a definite feeling it's gonna be a girl."
Ross	 Phoebe, you were sure Ben was gonna be a girl.'
Phoebe	 Have you seen him throw a ball?'
Ross	 Is Rachel here?'
Joey	 Uh, I think she's still asleep. Hey, hey, how did it go with you \n  guys last night? She seemed pretty pissed at you."
Ross	 Uh, we, y'know, we worked things out."
Phoebe	 What's that smile? Did something happen with you two?"
Ross	 Hey, I'm not one to kiss and tell, but I'm also not one to have \n  sex and shut up. We totally did it!"
Joey	 Oh my God. You and Rachel?'
Ross	 I know, it's pretty great."
Joey	 So what does that mean? Are you guys getting back together?'
Ross	 Oh, I.. I don't know. We didn't really get to talk."
Phoebe	 But do you wanna get back together?'
Ross	 I don't know. It was incredible. I mean, it just felt so right. \n  When I was holding her, I mean, I never wanted to let her go. You know \n  what? Yeah, I do. I wanna be together."
Phoebe	 (screaming) YAY!'
Ross	 Shhh!'
Phoebe	 (quietly) Yay!'
Joey	 So, so is she still going to Paris?'
Ross	 Wow, I hadn't thought of that. I hope not."
Phoebe	 Oh, this is like the best day ever. Ever! You guys might get \n  back together, Monica and Chandler are getting their baby, there are \n  chicks and ducks in the world again! Oh, I feel like I\'m in a musical! \n  (Singing) "Daa - raa... When the sun comes up, bright and beaming! And \n  the moon comes..."'
Rachel	 Morning!'
Phoebe	 Guess we'll never know how it ends."
Joey	 Okay.'
Ross	 Hey.'
Rachel	 Hey.'
Ross	 Hey. How did you sleep?'
Rachel	 Good. You?'
Ross	 Good.'
Joey	 I bet you did!'
Ross	 Uh. Would you guys mind giving us a minute?'
Joey	 Sure, yeah. Will you just keep an eye on the chick and the duck?'
Rachel	 Chick and the duck? Didn't they die..."
Phoebe	 (interrupting) Dive. Yeah, they dove head-first into fun on \n  the farm.'
Ross	 So...'
Ross	 Morning.'
Rachel	 You too. Last night was just wonderful.'
Ross	 It really was.'
Rachel	 I woke up today with the biggest smile on my face.'
Ross	 I know, me too. It was... You know, it was like one of those \n  things you think is never gonna happen, and then it does, and it's \n  everything you want it to be."
Rachel	 Uh-huh. I know. It was just, it was just the perfect way to say goodbye. (She hugs him, and Ross looks crushed.)'
Monica	 It's just a little bit more, honey."
Erica	 Help me! This hurts!'
Chandler	 Is it really that bad?'
Erica	 Uh-huh! I think it's time to kick you in the nuts and see which \n  is worse!"
Doctor	 The baby's head is crowning."
Monica	 Oh! Oh my God! That is the most beautiful top of a head I have \n  ever seen! Chandler, you have to see this!'
Chandler	 I'm okay."
Monica	 Chandler, you don't wanna miss this. This is the birth of your \n  child! It's the miracle of life!"
Chandler	 Alright. Wow, that is one disgusting miracle.'
Doctor	 Start pushing. Here we go. Here come the shoulders...'
Monica	 It's a... It's a boy!"
Chandler	 Wow!'
Erica	 Is he okay?'
Doctor	 He's just fine."
Monica	 Oh, you did it!'
Chandler	 (emotional) It's a baby! A beautiful little baby! And some\n  other stuff I'm gonna pretend I don't see."
Doctor	 Would you like to cut the umbilical cord?'
Chandler	 Well, that's spongy."
Monica	 (to her son) Oh, hey handsome! Oh, I'm gonna love you so much\n  that no woman is ever gonna be good enough for you! (To Chandler, on\n  the verge of tears) Oh, we are so lucky!"
Chandler	 I know. He has your eyes.'
Chandler	 I mean, I know that's not possible, but he does."
Nurse	 We'll just get him cleaned up a bit."
Chandler	 Okay.'
Monica	 (To Erica) Oh my God, he's beautiful. Thank you so much."
Erica	 I'm really happy for you guys."
Chandler	 How do you feel?'
Erica	 I'm tired!"
Doctor	 Well, you don't have that much time to relax. The other one \n  will be along in a minute."
Monica	 I... I'm sorry, who should be along in a what now?"
Doctor	 The next baby should be along in a minute.'
Monica	 We only ordered one!'
Doctor	 You know it's twins, right?"
Chandler	 Oh, yeah! These are the faces of two people in the know!'

Doctor	 I can't believe you didn't know it's twins! This has never \n  happened before."
Chandler	 Well, gosh. That makes me feel so special and good.'
Monica	 (to the doctor) Wait, did you know it was twins?'
Doctor	 Yeah, it's here in the paperwork we got from the clinic in \n  Ohio."
Monica	 (to Erica) Anybody tell you?'
Erica	 I don't think so. Although, they did mention something about \n  two heartbeats. But I thought that was just mine and the baby's. They \n  kept saying both heartbeats are really strong, and I thought well, \n  that's good 'cause I'm having a baby."
Monica	 This is unbelievable.'
Erica	 Twins actually run in my family.'
Chandler	 Interesting! (To Monica) Can I see you for a second?'
Chandler	 What do we do?'
Monica	 What do you mean "what do we do"?'
Chandler	 (panicking) Twins! Twins!!'
Monica	 Chandler, you're panicking!"
Chandler	 Uh-huh! Join me, won't you?! Okay, what do you say we keep\n  one, and then just like have an option on the other one?"
Monica	 We can't split them up!"
Chandler	 Why not? We could give each of them half a medallion, and \n  then years later, they'll find each other and be reunited. I mean, \n  that's a great day for everybody."
Monica	 Okay, what if the person who adopts the other one is horrible?'
Chandler	 What if they're not? What if it's adopted by a king?"
Monica	 Yeah, because I hear the king is looking to adopt.'
Chandler	 Monica, we are not ready to have two babies!'
Monica	 That doesn\'t matter! We have waited so long for this. I don\'t \n  care if it\'s two babies. I don\'t care if it\'s three babies! I don\'t \n  care if the entire cast of "Eight is Enough" comes out of there! We \n  are taking them home, because they are our children!'
Chandler	 (smiles) Okay. Shhh...'
Chandler	 Okay.'
Monica	 Okay!'
Chandler	 Okay!'
Doctor	 It looks like we're about ready over here."
Doctor	 Come on, Erica, start pushing again now.'
Erica	 Ow!'
Doctor	 Here she comes!'
Chandler	 (shocked) She? It's a girl?"
Doctor	 Yeah.'
Chandler	 (To Monica) Well, now we have one of each! (To the doctor) \n  And that's enough!"
Ross	 And then she said it was the perfect way to say goodbye.'
Joey	 Oh my God! What did you say?'
Ross	 Nothing! What do you say to that?'
Phoebe	 Ross, you've got to tell her how you feel!"
Ross	 No way!'
Joey	 You can't just give up! Is that what a dinosaur would do?"
Ross	 What?'
Joey	 Dude, I'm just trying to speak your language."
Phoebe	 Ross, Rachel doesn't know that you wanna get back together. If \n  she did, she might feel differently. She might not even go."
Ross	 You really think so?'
Phoebe	 I\'m telling you! Oh, okay! This is the part of the musical \n  where there\'d be a really good convincing song. (Singing) "Bam-bam, \n  don\'t take no for an answer. Bam-bam, don\'t let love fly away. \n  Bam-bam-bam-bam..."'
Rachel	 Hi!'
Phoebe	 Can't a girl finish a song around here?"
Joey	 Hey!'
Rachel	 Hi! So I just dropped Emma off at my mom's."
Ross	 Okay.'
Joey	 Oh, you're not taking her with you tonight?"
Rachel	 No, we decided that I would go ahead and set up first, and \n  then my mom would bring Emma to Paris on Sunday.'
Phoebe	 Wow, eight hour flight with a one-year old? Good luck, mom.'
Rachel	 Are you kidding? Eight hours with my mother talking about \n  Atkins? Good luck, Emma!'
Ross	 Alright, you know what? You're right. I should at least tell her\n  how I feel."
Joey	 Ross, wait!'
Ross	 What? What?'
Joey	 Could you get me a muffin?'
Gunther	 Rachel?'
Rachel	 Yeah?'
Gunther	 I... I know you're leaving tonight, but I just have to tell\n  you. I love you."
Gunther	 I... I don't know if that changes your plans at all, but I\n  thought you should know."
Rachel	 (touched) Gunther... Oh... I love you too. Probably not in the\n  same way, but I do. And, and when I'm in a caf\xc3\xa9, having coffee, or I\n  see a man with hair brighter than the sun, I'll think of you. Aw."
Rachel	 Oh... Bye guys.'
Ross	 Oh my God!'
Phoebe	 Unbelievable!'
Joey	 Hey, you know what might help?'
Ross	 I'm not getting you a muffin!"
Monica	 Do you think they recognize each other from in there?'
Chandler	 Maybe. Unless they're like two people who have lived in \n  apartments next to each other for years, and then one day they're \n  pushed through a vagina and they meet."
Nurse	 We're going to take Erica to recovery now."
Monica	 There's something that we wanna tell you. We decided to name \n  the girl-baby Erica."
Erica	 Oh my God, that's just like my name!"
Monica	 Son of a gun, it is!'
Erica	 Anyway, I'm gonna go and get some rest. I'm really glad I \n  picked you guys. You're gonna make great parents. Even Chandler."
Monica	 Okay, well, bye!'
Erica	 Bye!'
Chandler	 Bye!'
Monica	 We'll call you!"
Erica	 Okay.'
Chandler	 Have fun at church-camp!'
Monica	 Oh, look at these little bunnies!'
Chandler	 I know! You ready to trade?'
Monica	 Okay.'
Chandler	 Okay.'
Monica	 Alright, let's see.."
Chandler	 We could trade later.'
Monica	 Yeah, I'm good."
Phoebe	 Hey, what are you working on?'
Joey	 It\'s a... It\'s a "welcome home" sign for the baby.'
Phoebe	 How sweet! Oh, is that the baby?'
Joey	 No, I sat in the paint.'
Ross	 Hey.'
Phoebe	 Hey. So, did you talk to Rachel?'
Ross	 No, and I'm not going to."
Phoebe	 What?'
Joey	 Why not?'
Ross	 Because she's just going to shoot me down. You guys saw what \n  happened with Gunther. That did not look like fun."
Phoebe	 How can you compare yourself to Gunther? I mean, sure, he's \n  sexy in a more obvious way. You have a relationship with her, you \n  slept together last night."
Ross	 Yeah, and she still wants to go! It's pretty clear where she is."
Joey	 Yeah, I know what you mean. I mean, sometimes...'
Phoebe	 Uh, Joe?'
Joey	 Damn it!'
Ross	 Look, even if I were gonna tell her, I don't have to do it now. \n  Okay? I'll be seeing her again. We've got time."
Phoebe	 No, you don't! She's going to Paris! She is going to meet \n  somebody. Do you know how many hot guys there are in Paris? It's... \n  It's a city of Gunthers!"
Mike	 Hey!'
Phoebe	 Hey! What do you have there?'
Mike	 Oh, I made a little something. If I had more time to work on it, \n  it'd be better, but.."
Ross	 Oh my God! You did that yourself?'
Phoebe	 Honey, that's gorgeous!"
Joey	 You know, the baby can't read, Mike!"
Rachel	 Hi! You guys, the car-service just got here. I can't believe\n  they're not home yet! I have to catch my stupid plane. I wanna see the\n  baby!"
Joey	 Monica just called from the cab. She said they should be here\n  any minute. And apparently, there's some big surprise."
Phoebe	 Yeah, did she sound happy about it? 'Cause my friend Ethel's\n  baby was born with a teeny, tiny beard."
Rachel	 Oh my God!'
Ross	 Oh my God!'
Rachel	 Hi! Oh my gosh!'
Chandler	 Hey.'
Phoebe, Ross, Rachel	 Hey.'
Joey	 (To Monica) Hey, so what is the big surprise?'
Rachel	 Oh.'
Ross	 Oh my God!'
Rachel	 What... What...'
Ross	 Okay, okay, awkward question. The hospital knows you took two, \n  right?'
Monica	 Yes, it's twins!"
Ross	 Oh my God.'
Joey	 Oh, they're so cute! Now, what, what kinds are they?"
Monica	 (points at the baby she's holding) This is a boy, (points at \n  the baby Chandler is holding) and that's a girl."
Chandler	 Her name is Erica.'
Rachel	 Aw..'
Joey	 Hey, that pregnant girl's name was Erica."
Chandler	 Yeah. It's a shame you two didn't get to spend more time\n  together."
Monica	 Yeah, we named the boy Jack after dad.'
Ross	 Aw, he's gonna be so happy."
Phoebe	 Oh, Jack Bing. I love that. Ooh, it sounds like a \'40s\n  newspaper guy, you know? "Jack Bing, Morning Gazette. I\'m gonna blow\n  this story wide open!"'
Rachel	 Oh my gosh. Wow, so beautiful.'
Mike	 (To Phoebe) I want one.'
Phoebe	 Oh yeah? Well, tell me which one, and I'll try slip it in my\n  coat."
Mike	 Seriously. Wanna make one of those?'
Phoebe	 One? How about a whole bunch?'
Mike	 Really?'
Phoebe	 Yeah! Ooh, we could teach them to sing, and we can be like the\n  Von Trapp family! Only without the Nazis. Although that sounds kinda\n  dull.'
Rachel	 Oh, you guys, I can't believe this. But I'll leave now, or I'm\n  gonna miss my plane."
Monica	 I'm just so glad you got to see the babies."
Rachel	 Me too. Oh, I'm just sorry I'm not gonna be around to watch\n  you two attempt to handle this! Alright, I can't say goodbye to you\n  guys again. I love you all so much."
Monica	 I love you.'
Chandler	 I love you.'
Monica	 Call us when you get there.'
Rachel	 I will. Ross, come here.'
Rachel	 I just want you to know.. Last night.. I'll never forget it."
Ross	 Neither will I.'
Rachel	 Alright, now I really have to go. Okay. Au revoir! Oh, they're \n  gonna really hate me over there."
Phoebe	 So, you just let her go?'
Ross	 Yeah.'
Joey	 Hey, maybe that's for the best."
Ross	 Yeah?'
Joey	 Yeah. You know? You just... Look, you gotta... You gotta think \n  about last night the way she does, okay? Maybe, maybe sleeping \n  together was the perfect way to say goodbye?'
Phoebe	 But now she'll never know how he feels!"
Joey	 Maybe that's okay. You know? Maybe, maybe it is better this way? \n  I mean, now, now you can move on. I mean, you've been trying to for so\n  long, maybe now that you're on different continents.. (Looks at\n  Phoebe) Right?"
Joey	 Maybe now you can actually do it. You know? You can finally get\n  over her.'
Ross	 Yeah, that's true. Except I don't wanna get over her."
Joey	 What?'
Ross	 I don't! I wanna be with her."
Joey	 Really?'
Ross	 Yeah, I'm gonna go after her."
Joey	 Yeah, you are!'
Phoebe	 Woo!'
Phoebe	 Wait, wait! Get your coat! Get your coat!'
Ross	 My coat...'
Joey	 This is so cool!'
Chandler	 I have no idea what's going on, but I am excited!"
Joey	 But Ross, Ross. What do you, what do you think she's going to\n  say?"
Ross	 I don't know, but I.. Look, even if she shoots me down, at least\n  I won't spend the rest of my life wondering what would have happened.\n  Where - where is my coat?!"
Phoebe	 You didn't bring one! My cab's downstairs, I'll drive you to\n  the airport."
Ross	 Okay, guys, wish me luck.'
Phoebe	 Hurry!'
Joey	 Good luck, good luck!'
Ross	 There's no seatbelt!"
Phoebe	 That's okay. If - if we hit anything, the engine will explode, \n  so you know, it's better if you're thrown from the car."
Ross	 Alright, alright, let's do this!"
Phoebe	 Okay!'
Ross	 Hey!'
Man	 18th and East End.'
Phoebe	 I - I don't take passengers."
Man	 Hey! The law says you have to accept any fare.'
Ross	 No, you don't understand. This isn't a real cab."
Man	 Alright, I gotta report you. What's your medallion number?"
Phoebe	 My medallion number is, "Get out of the cab!"'
Man	 What?'
Ross	 (screaming) Get out of the cab!'
Phoebe	 Get out of the cab!'
Joey	 Oh, hey, hey, can I give you guys your house-warming present \n  now?'
Monica	 Now, that you can do.'
Joey	 Alright!'
Joey	 Ah... Chick Jr.? Duck Jr.? Don't hide from mama!"
Phoebe	 You can open your eyes now.'
Ross	 Are we off the bridge?'
Phoebe	 Yes.'
Ross	 Is the old woman on the bicycle still alive?'
Phoebe	 Yes, she jumped right back up.'
Ross	 Oh my God, Phoebe, slow down!'
Phoebe	 Do you wanna get to Rachel in time?'
Ross	 Yes, but I don't wanna die in your cab!"
Phoebe	 You should have thought of that before you got in!'
Phoebe	 Toll-booth.'
Ross	 What?'
Phoebe	 (screaming) Toll-booth! Four bucks. There are quarters in the \n  glove compartment.'
Phoebe	 Hurry!'
Ross	 Okay!'
Phoebe	 Okay.'
Phoebe	 Damn, that window is clean.'
Joey	 Quack, quack, tweet, tweet, quack, quack, tweet, tweet, quack,\n  quack, tweet, tweet, quack, quack, tweet, tweet, quack, tweet, quack...'
Chandler	 We were wondering what was taking so long with the gift, but\n  now we understand you were doing this.'
Joey	 Okay, I wanted to surprise you, but for your house-warming gift,\n  I got you a baby-chick and a baby-duck!'
Chandler	 Really? You got us a chick and a duck?'
Monica	 Oh, great! Just what you want for a new house with infants.\n  Bird feces.'
Joey	 Yeah, yeah, they must have jumped off the table, 'cause now\n  they're gone!"
Chandler	 Oh, don't worry, we'll find them."
Monica	 Actually, I'm gonna go check on the twins."
Chandler	 Alright.'
Monica	 Oh God! What did I just step on?'
Joey	 Oh!'
Chandler	 It's okay, it's just an egg roll."
Monica	 Oh..'
Joey	 You stepped on my egg roll?'
Monica	 I'm sorry, I didn't know to look for Chinese food on the \n  floor."
Joey	 Just put it on a plate and leave.'
Chandler	 Okay, let's find these birds."
Joey	 Alright.'
Joey	 Wait, wait. Do you hear that?'
Joey	 Oh! They're in the table!"
Chandler	 Well, that can't be good!"
Joey	 We gotta get them out of there!'
Chandler	 How?'
Joey	 Oh, oh! Maybe we can lure them out. You know any birdcalls?'
Chandler	 Oh, tons, I'm quite the woodsman."
Joey	 Well, maybe we can just tip the table a little.'
Chandler	 Joey, wait! The ball!'
Joey	 Oh!'
Joey	 Oh God! So what do we do?'
Chandler	 I don't know. Maybe we can open this up somehow."
Joey	 Okay.'
Chandler	 No... It's all glued together."
Joey	 Does that mean we have to bust it open?'
Chandler	 I don't know. Maybe."
Joey	 Oh my God!'
Chandler	 I know! It's.. It's the foosball table."
Joey	 All right, you know what? We don\'t have a choice. It\'s like I would \n  have said in that sci-fi movie if I\'d gotten the part. "Those are our \n  men in there, we have to get them out! Even if I have to sacrifice the \n  most important thing in my life; my time-machine."'
Chandler	 Did that movie ever get made?'
Joey	 It did not.'
Phoebe	 Ross, where are you going?'
Ross	 To talk to Rachel, isn't that why we took a ride in the \n  death-cab?"
Phoebe	 What? What are you just gonna walk up to her at the gate? Have \n  you never chased anyone through the airport before?'
Ross	 Not since my cop-show got cancelled.'
Phoebe	 You have to get a ticket to get past security.'
Ross	 What? We're never gonna make it!"
Phoebe	 Not with that attitude! Now, haul ass!'
Ross	 Okay, if you could all walk slower, that'd be great. "
Gate attendant #1	 (with a French accent) Madame, your passport \n  please?'
Rachel	 Oh my God! I was so afraid I wasn't gonna remember any of my \n  high-school French, but I understood every word you just said!"
Gate attendant #1	 Your boarding pass, please.'
Rachel	 Oh.'
Rachel	 Oh, shoot. I had it. Oh, I can't believe this."
Gate attendant #1	 Madame, if you don't have your boarding pass..."
Rachel	 I have it, I have it, I have it. Oh, okay, I can't find it, \n  but I remember that I was in seat 32C, because that's my bra-size."
Gate attendant #1	 Madame, you must have your boarding pass..'
Rachel	 Okay, fine! But you know what? If I was in 36D, we would not \nbe having this problem. '
Ross	 Hey, I need a ticket.'
Phoebe	 Just one? I drive you all the way down here, and I don't get \n  to see how it works out?"
Ross	 Fine, two tickets, I need two tickets.'
Phoebe	 We're on our honeymoon."
Ticket agent	 And the destination?'
Ross	 I don't care. Whatever is the cheapest."
Phoebe	 I'm so lucky I married you."
Rachel	 Oh! Shoot! Damn it! Where is it? Oh! Oh! I found it! I found \n  it!'
Rachel	 Hah! I found it! I told you I would find it! In your face! \nYou're a different person. "
Ross	 Okay, flight 421 to Paris. I don't see it, do you see it?"
Phoebe	 No, did we miss it?'
Ross	 No, no, no. That's impossible. It doesn't leave for another 20 \n  minutes."
Phoebe	 Maybe we have the flight-number wrong. God.'
Monica	 Hello.'
Phoebe	 Hey, it's me. Here's Ross."
Ross	 What? Hey, hey, listen..'
Monica	 Oh my God! Ross, you wouldn't believe the cute little noises \n  the twins are making. Listen."
Ross	 Monica? Monica, Monica, Monica, Monica..?'
Monica	 Oh, I'm sorry. Shoot, they were doing it before."
Ross	 That's alright. Listen, listen."
Monica	 Oh, wait, wait, wait! Here they go again.'
Ross	 Monica? Monica, Monica, Monica, Monica..?'
Monica	 Isn't that cute?"
Ross	 That is precious! Listen! I need Rachel's flight information."
Monica	 Oh, okay. Alright, it's flight 421. Leaves at 8
Ross	 Yes, that's what I have. It's not on the board."
Monica	 That's what it says here. Flight 421, leaves at 8
Ross	 What?'
Monica	 Newark airport. Why, where are you?'
Ross	 JFK.'
Joey	 (yelling) Don't worry, you guys, we're gonna get you out of \n  there."
Chandler	 And we're also gonna buy you tiny, bird hearing-aids."
Joey	 Okay. Here goes.'
Chandler	 What's the matter?"
Joey	 I need to say goodbye to the table first.'
Chandler	 I understand.'
Joey	 Okay. Table, you have given us so many great times. And you \n  guys, Jordan, Victor, Joel... All of you guys. What can I say? You \n  guys make us look good. You wanna say anything?'
Chandler	 I don't know. Except that, for one last time... (he touches \n  the players as he says the following) Good game, good game, good game, \n  good game, good game, good game, good game."
Joey	 Okay, here we go. I can't do it."
Chandler	 Well, I can't do it either."
Monica	 Hey! Did you find them?'
Joey	 Yeah, they're stuck inside the table!"
Chandler	 We have to bust it open, but neither of us can do it!'
Monica	 Oh, well sure. This gotta be so hard. I'll do it. Gimme!"
Ross	 Phoebe! Wow! No, no, no!'
Phoebe	 Well, I've never gone this fast before."
Ross	 Phoebe, forget it, okay? Newark is - is like an hour away. \n  There's no way we're gonna make it in time."
Phoebe	 She's got her cell, you could call her."
Ross	 I am not doing this over the phone.'
Phoebe	 You don't have any other choice!"
Rachel	 Hello?'
Phoebe	 Rachel? Oh, good. Hey, by the way, did you just get on the \n  plane?'
Rachel	 Yeah.'
Phoebe	 (To Ross) For what it's worth, we would have caught her if we were at the right airport."
Ross	 Yay.'
Phoebe	 Uh, Rach, hang on.'
Rachel	 Phoebe? Is everything okay?'
Phoebe	 Uhm, actually no. No, you've... You have to get off the plane."
Rachel	 What? Why?'
Phoebe	 I have this feeling that something's wrong with it. Something \n  is wrong with the left Philange."
Rachel	 Oh, honey, I'm sure there's nothing wrong with the plane."
Rachel	 Alright, look, I have to go. I love you, and I will call you \n  the minute I get to Paris.'
Passenger #1	 Uhm, what was that?'
Rachel	 Oh, that was just my crazy friend. She told me I should get \n  off the plane, because she had a feeling that there was something \n  wrong with the left Philange.'
Passenger #1	 Okay, that doesn't sound good."
Rachel	 I wouldn't worry about it. She's always coming up with stuff \n  like this, and you know what? She's almost never right."
Passenger #1	 But she is sometimes.'
Rachel	 Well...'
Rachel	 Wait, what are you doing?'
Passenger #1	 Well, I can't take this plane now."
Air stewardess	 Excuse me, sir, where are you going?'
Passenger #1	 I have to get off this plane, okay? Her friend has a \n  feeling something's wrong with the left Philange."
Rachel	 Could I get some peanuts?'
Passenger #2	 What's wrong with the plane?"
Air stewardess	 There's nothing wrong with the plane."
Passenger #1	 Yeah! The left Philange!'
Air stewardess	 There is no Philange!'
Passenger #1	 Oh my God. This plane doesn't even have a Philange!"
Passenger #2	 I'm not flying on it!"
Air stewardess	 Ma'am, please sit down!"
Passenger #3	 What's going on?"
Passenger #1	 We're all getting off. There is no Philange!"
Rachel	 This is ridiculous! I...'
Rachel	 Yeah, okay.'
Monica	 Alright. My job here is done.'
Chandler	 That was... Impressive.'
Joey	 Yeah, you didn't even use the tools for most of it!"
Monica	 Yeah, they were just slowing me down. Alright, I have to get \n  back to the babies. I'll see you girls later."
Chandler	 Sorry about the table, man.'
Joey	 Yeah.'
Chandler	 You gonna buy a new one?'
Joey	 Probably not. Nah. I don't know how much I'm gonna wanna play \n  after you go."
Chandler	 Well, at least we got these little guys out.'
Joey	 Yeah.'
Chandler	 Aww, we were worried about you! Hm. I guess I better get \n  used to things crapping in my hand, huh?'
Joey	 I'm gonna miss these little guys. It was nice having birds \n  around again."
Chandler	 Hey, you know what? Maybe we should keep them here with you.'
Joey	 What?'
Chandler	 Yeah, I mean we've got a lot going on right now. And, plus, \n  here they'd have their own room."
Joey	 I could get a goose!'
Chandler	 You know, I - I think you're set with the poultry."
Joey	 Thanks man. Did you hear that, you guys? You're gonna get to \n  stay here! And, and it's good, you know, 'cause, 'cause now you have a \n  reason to come visit."
Chandler	 I think there may be another reason. So, awkward hug or lame \n  cool guy handshake?'
Joey	 Uh, lame cool guy handshake, yeah.'
Gate attendant #2	 Ma'am, I assure you, the plane is fine."
Passenger #2	 And you fixed the Philange?'
Gate attendant #2	 Yes, the Philange is fixed. As a matter of fact, we \n  put a whole lot of extra Philanges onboard, just in case.'
Ross	 Where is she?'
Phoebe	 I don't see her."
Ross	 Rachel! Rachel Green!'
Phoebe	 There she is!'
Ross	 Rachel! Rachel!'
Gate attendant #2	 Wow, excuse me, sir, do you have a boarding pass?'
Ross	 No, no, I just have to talk to someone.'
Gate attendant #2	 I'm sorry, you cannot go any further without a \n  boarding pass."
Ross	 No, no, no, but...'
Phoebe	 (screaming) RACHEL!!'
Rachel	 Oh my God... What.. What are you guys doing here?'
Phoebe	 Okay, you're on."
Rachel	 What? What? Ross, you're scaring me. What's going on?"
Ross	 Okay, the thing is..'
Rachel	 Yeah?'
Ross	 Don't go."
Rachel	 What?'
Ross	 Please, please stay with me. I am so in love with you. Please, \n  don't go."
Rachel	 Oh my God.'
Ross	 I know, I know. I shouldn't have waited 'till now to say it, but \n  I'm.. That was stupid, okay? I'm sorry, but I'm telling you now. I \n  love you. Do not get on this plane."
Gate attendant #2	 Miss? Are you boarding the plane?'
Ross	 Hey, hey. I know you love me. I know you do.'
Gate attendant #2	 Miss?'
Rachel	 I - I have to get on the plane.'
Ross	 No, you don't."
Rachel	 Yes, I do.'
Ross	 No, you don't."
Rachel	 They're waiting for me, Ross. I can't do this right now, I'm \n  sorry. I'm sorry."
Ross	 Rachel?'
Rachel	 I'm so sorry."
Ross	 I really thought she'd stay."
Phoebe	 I'm sorry."
Monica	 Well, that's it. Everything's packed."
Chandler	 Wow, this is weird.'
Monica	 I know.'
Joey	 Yeah. Uh, does this mean there's nothing to eat?"
Monica	 I put three lasagnas in your freezer.'
Joey	 I love you!'
Joey	 Hey!'
Phoebe	 Hey.'
Joey	 So did you guys make it in time?'
Phoebe	 Yeah, yeah, he talked to her, but she got on the plane anyway.'
Chandler	 Where's Ross?"
Phoebe	 He went home. He didn't want to see anybody."
Rachel	 (on the answering machine) Ross, hi. It's me. I just got back \n  on the plane. And I just feel awful. That is so not how I wanted \n  things to end with us. It's just that I wasn't expecting to see you, \n  and all of a sudden you're there and saying these things... And... And \n  now I'm just sitting here and thinking of all the stuff I should have \n  said, and I didn't. I mean, I didn't even get to tell you that I love \n  you too. Because of course I do. I love you. I love you. I love you. \n  What am I doing? I love you! Oh, I've gotta see you. I've gotta get \n  off this plane."
Ross	 Oh my God!'
Rachel	 (on the answering machine) Excuse me?'
Air stewardess	 (on the answering machine) Miss? Please, sit down!'
Rachel	 (on the answering machine) I'm sorry. I'm really sorry, but I \n  need to get off the plane, okay? I need to tell someone that I love \n  love them."
Air stewardess	 (on the answering machine) Miss, I can't let you off \n  the plane."
Ross	 Let her off the plane!'
Air stewardess	 (on the answering machine) I am afraid you are gonna \n  have to take a seat.'
Rachel	 (on the answering machine) Oh, please, miss, you don't \n  understand!"
Ross	 Try to understand!'
Rachel	 (on the answering machine) Oh, come on, miss, isn't there any \n  way that you can just let me off..."
Ross	 No! No! Oh my God. Did she get off the plane? Did she get off \n  the plane?'
Rachel	 I got off the plane.'
Ross	 You got off the plane.'
Rachel	 I do love you.'
Ross	 I love you too, and I'm never letting you go again."
Rachel	 Okay. 'Cause this is where I wanna be, okay? No more messing \n  around. I don't wanna mess this up again."
Ross	 Me neither, okay? We are - we're done being stupid."
Rachel	 Okay. You and me, alright? This is it.'
Ross	 This is it. Unless we're on a break."
Ross	 Don't make jokes now."
Monica	 Okay, please be careful with that. It was my grandmother's. Be \n  careful."
Monica	 If that falls off the truck, it wouldn't be the worst thing."
Ross	 Wow.'
Rachel	 I know. It seems smaller somehow.'
Joey	 Has it always been purple?'
Chandler	 (to his children) Look around, you guys. This was your first \n  home. And it was a happy place, filled with love and laughter. But \n  more important, because of rent control, it was a friggin' steal!"
Phoebe	 Hey, do you realise that at one time or another we all lived \n  in this apartment?'
Monica	 Oh, yeah, that's true."
Ross	 Uh, I haven't."
Monica	 Wait a minute. What about that summer during college that you \n  lived with grandma, and you tried to make it as a dancer?'
Ross	 Do you realise we almost made it ten years without that coming \n  up?'
Monica	 Oh, honey, I forgot. I promised Treeger that we'd leave our \n  keys."
Chandler	 Oh, okay.'
Phoebe	 So, I guess this is it.'
Joey	 Yeah. I guess so.'
Monica	 (crying) This is harder than I thought it would be.'
Chandler	 Oh, it's gonna be okay."
Rachel	 (crying) Do you guys have to go to the new house right away, \n  or do you have some time?'
Monica	 We got some time.'
Rachel	 Okay, should we get some coffee?'
Chandler	 Sure. Where?'
