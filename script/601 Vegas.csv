Chandler	 Okay! (Stands up) This is it! (Claps his hands) We're gonna get\nmarried!"
Monica	 Are you sure you wanna do this?'
Ross	 Well, hello, Mrs. Ross! (Throws some rice.)'
Rachel	 Well, hello, Mr. Rachel! (Throws some more rice.)'
Rachel	 Wait! (Gets her bearings) Okay!'
Monica	 Whoa!'
Chandler	 Oh my God!'
Joey	 (entering with Phoebe) Come on Pheebs! Hurry! Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!'
Phoebe	 Okay! Okay! Okay! (They run into the chapel.)'
Chandler	 Oh my God!! Is everybody getting married?!!'
Attendant	 (scolding them) N-No running in the chapel!'
Phoebe	 (to her) Hey! Don\xc2\x92t you give me any of your\xc2\x97Hey! (Sees\nChandler and Monica standing there.)'
Chandler	 Hey!'
Joey	 Hey!'
Monica	 What are you guys doing here?'
Joey	 Ross and Rachel left us a message saying they were getting married!\nIsn\xc2\x92t that why you guys are here?'
Chandler	 Yes! Well that-yes.'
Monica	 Why else would we be here?'
Joey	 Well! What happened?! Did we miss it?'
Chandler	 We actually missed it.'
Phoebe	 Well, maybe you wouldn\xc2\x92t have had you (turns to the attendant) run\nin the chapel!'
Monica	 This is insane!'
Phoebe	 What\xc2\x92s the big deal, y\xc2\x92know? It\xc2\x92s not like it\xc2\x92s a\nreal marriage.'
Chandler	 What?!'
Phoebe	 Yeah, if you get married in Vegas, you\xc2\x92re only married in Vegas.'
Monica	 What are you talking about? If you get married in Vegas you\xc2\x92re\nmarried everywhere.'
Phoebe	 (shocked) Really?! '
Monica	 Yeah!'
Phoebe	 Oh my God!\xc2\x97Eh! Well\xc2\x85'

Rachel	 Ohhh! (Looks in the mirror and sees that she still has her mustache and\ngroans.)'
Ross	 Why are we in bed together?'
Rachel	 I don\xc2\x92t know. Do-do you have any clothes on?'
Ross	 (checks) Yeah.'
Rachel	 Really?!'
Ross	 No! But we-we didn\xc2\x92t have\xc2\x85sex-uh, did we? I mean, I don\xc2\x92t\nremember much about last night, it was such a blur.'
Rachel	 Oh! I remember laughing! I laughed a lot.'
Ross	 And we didn\xc2\x92t have sex. '
Rachel	 Ohh, I mean, we were really drunk. I\xc2\x92m just glad we didn\xc2\x92t do\nanything stupid.'
Ross	 (getting up) Tell me about it. (He sits up on the edge of the bed and has\n"Just Married" written on his back.)'
Joey	 Mornin\xc2\x92 Pheebs. (Sits down.) Well, my movie has officially been\ncanceled.'
Phoebe	 Oh Joey, I\xc2\x92m so sorry. You want some of my breakfast?'
Joey	 Nah, I\xc2\x92m too depressed to eat. I\xc2\x92ll probably eat in like 5\nminutes. So I guess I\xc2\x92ll just fly home with you guys, what time\xc2\x92s your flight?'
Phoebe	 What about my cab?'
Joey	 I don\xc2\x92t need that anymore.'
Phoebe	 No, Joey! You borrowed my cab; you have to drive it back.'
Joey	 I don\xc2\x92t want to drive all the way back by myself, I get so lonely.\n(Gets an idea.) Oh\xc2\x97ooh! How about you come with me?'
Phoebe	 I don\xc2\x92t know, it\xc2\x92s such a long trip.'
Joey	 It\xc2\x92ll be great! We-we could talk, and play games! Huh? This could be\nour chance to like renew our friendship.'
Phoebe	 Are you asking me to have a frenaissance?'
Joey	 Sure?'
Phoebe	 All right. Although I don\xc2\x92t think we need one, I never stopped\nloving you.'
Chandler	 Hi!'
Joey	 Hey.'
Monica	 Hey.'
Chandler	 So, has anyone talked to Dr. and Mrs. Geller yet?'
Phoebe	 Um-hmm, yeah. They left me a message; they should be here any minute.'
Joey	 Where is the waitress?! I\xc2\x92m starving!'
Chandler	 It\xc2\x92s a buffet man.'
Joey	 Oh, here\xc2\x92s where I win all my money back! (Gets up and heads for the\nbuffet table with Chandler in tow.)'
Chandler	 Listen, I gotta talk to you.'
Joey	 Sure! What\xc2\x92s up? (He grabs a plate and proceeds to load it with a\nhuge pile of scrambled eggs. Chandler just stares at him and Joey reluctantly gives him a\nspoonful.)'
Chandler	 Monica and I almost got married last night.'
Joey	 Oh my God! That\xc2\x92s huge! (Hugs him.) Wait a minute, why come I\nwasn\xc2\x92t invited? And who was going to be your best man? Don\xc2\x92t say,\n"Ross." Do not say, "Ross."'
Chandler	 Look, I just don\xc2\x92t think Monica and I are ready to get married\nyet! Y\xc2\x92know? I mean, I love her and everything but seeing Ross and Rachel coming out\nof that chapel was like a, like a wake-up call that Monica and I are moving so fast.\nY\xc2\x92know? And, how do I tell her without crushing her?'
Joey	 Oh! Tell her she\xc2\x92s not marriage material.'
Chandler	 What?!'
Joey	 Girls say it to me all the time! And believe me, if she\xc2\x92s anything\nlike me, she\xc2\x92s just gonna be relieved.'
Monica	 How do I tell Chandler that it\xc2\x92s too soon. It\xc2\x92s gonna break\nhis heart, he\xc2\x92s not gonna think that I don\xc2\x92t love him anymore.'
Phoebe	 Well you don\xc2\x92t.'
Monica	 Yes I do!'
Phoebe	 Good! Good! I was just testing you.'
Chandler	 (returning with Joey) Hi.'
Monica	 Oh hi! Hi! Y\xc2\x92know, we were just talking about bacon.'
Phoebe	 No, we were talking about tennis. Tennis is more believable. '
Ross	 Hey!'
Chandler	 Hey!'
Ross	 What?'
Chandler	 Are we gonna talk about what you guys did last night? Or\xc2\x85'
Rachel	 (To Ross) I don\xc2\x92t know. (To the gang.) What do you mean last night?\nNothing, nothing uh, happened last night.'
Ross	 Yeah!'
Phoebe	 Uh-huh! Ross invited us all to watch.'
Monica	 Rach! We weren\xc2\x92t gonna miss our friends getting married!'
Rachel	 (gasps) Who got married?! (Ross is as surprised to hear this as she is.)'
Chandler	 (not quite sure) You did.'
Ross	 What?! Hello! We didn\xc2\x92t get married.'
Rachel	 No, we didn\xc2\x92t get married! That\xc2\x92s ridiculous!'

Ross	 We-we-we\xc2\x97I remember being in a chapel.'
Rachel	 Oh my God.'
Ross	 I\xc2\x97They would not let us get married when we were that drunk!'
Rachel	 No!'
Joey	 They let you get married when you\xc2\x92re drunk! Most people who get\nmarried in Vegas are drunk!'
Phoebe	 Hell, I\xc2\x92m drunk right now! (They all turn and look at her.) What? I\ncan\xc2\x92t have a mimosa with breakfast?! I\xc2\x92m on vacation!'
Monica	 What are you guys gonna do?'
Rachel	 Well, I guess we just find a divorce lawyer? (Looks at Ross.)'
Chandler	 Well, I think, I think, Ross already has one. Now, this one\xc2\x92s\nfree, right? Because you paid for the first two, so the third one\xc2\x92s free.'
Ross	 Laugh it up, but the joke\xc2\x92s on you. Because we don\xc2\x92t need to get\ndivorced, okay? We we\xc2\x92re just gonna get an annulment. '
Joey	 An annulment? Ross! I don\xc2\x92t think surgery\xc2\x92s the answer here.'
Phoebe	 Oh-oh, that\xc2\x92s your thing.'
Ross	 What?'
Phoebe	 You\xc2\x92re thing. You\xc2\x92re thing. Y\xc2\x92know? You\xc2\x92re the guy\nwho gets divorced.'
All	 Oh yeah!'
Ross	 No-no, that\xc2\x92s-that\xc2\x92s not my thing! I do not love getting\ndivorced!'
Phoebe	 Yes you do! This is your third divorce! You love divorce so much\nyou\xc2\x92re probably gonna marry it! Then it won\xc2\x92t work out and you\xc2\x92re gonna\nhave to divorce it, divorcing guy. (Pause) I\xc2\x92m so drunk.'
Monica	 So, what do you think we should do?'
Chandler	 I don\xc2\x92t know. But I-I-I know I love you!'
Monica	 I know I love you! (They hug.)'
Chandler	 So where are we on the whole going back to the place where they have\nall the marriages thing? I love you.'
Monica	 That\xc2\x92s a good question. Look umm, last night we let the dice\ndecide. Maybe we should leave it up to fate again. I love you!'
Chandler	 Yes, we don\xc2\x92t get married unless there\xc2\x92s a sign! Okay, so\nsay uh, say you roll another eight (motions to the craps table) then there\xc2\x92s a definite\nsign that we should get married.'
Monica	 All right, eight we get married, but 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12 we\ndon\xc2\x92t get married.'
Chandler	 Sounds great.'
Monica	 Okay. (They approach the craps table.)'
Croupler	 Coming in, we got a shooter! Money please.'
Monica	 Ready?'
Chandler	 Ready!'
Monica	 (sarcastic) Come on eight.'
Chandler	 (deadpan) Yes, yes eight.'
Croupler	 Eight! Easy eight. (She rolls a 3 and a 5 and they\xc2\x92re stunned.)'
Monica	 Wow! I can\xc2\x92t believe I actually rolled an eight.'
Chandler	 That was so unlikely. Well, let\xc2\x92s get married! I guess.'
Monica	 Wait a minute. That wasn\xc2\x92t a hard eight! Last night I rolled a hard\neight.'
Chandler	 That\xc2\x92s right! It was the wrong kind of eight, no wedding! Damnit!'
Monica	 I wanted it so bad! (Pause) Wanna go pack?'
Chandler	 Yeah. (They go pack.) We\xc2\x92re doing the right thing, right?'
Monica	 Ohh, of course we are! (They walk up to the elevators.) We left it up to\nfate. (Pushes the elevator button.) If we were supposed to get married there would be a\nclear-cut sign. (The elevator door opens to a priest reading from a bible with Chandler\nand Monica standing side-by-side holding each other\xc2\x92s hands.)'
Phoebe	 Okay, you have 19 questions left. Use them wisely. (Joey groans.) Come\non Joey! You can\xc2\x92t win if you don\xc2\x92t ask any (sees that he\xc2\x92s asleep) QUESTIONS!!!'
Joey	 (wakes up) What?!'
Phoebe	 Well, you promised me a fun road trip! We\xc2\x92ve been on the road six\nhours and you\xc2\x92ve been asleep for five and a half! We are switching at the next rest\nstop and you are going to drive all the way back! That will be your punishment, you\ngreedy sleeper!'
Joey	 All right. All right.'
Phoebe	 Yeah! And until then you are going to sing to me because the\nradio\xc2\x92s broken and you are selfish but have a nice voice.'
Joey	 Really? I don\xc2\x92t\xc2\x85'
Phoebe	 Sing!!'
Joey	 (starts singing) I wanna rock and roll all night! (Falls asleep.)'
Joey	 (to himself) Man, this is a long drive! Are my eyes open? No! (He opens\nhis eyes and sees a hitchhiker.)'
Hitchhiker	 (driving) Morning! (Phoebe screams again.)'
Ross	 Hey!'
Rachel	 Hey, hubby!'
Ross	 Yeah. Yeah, actually um, I wanted to talk to you about that whole\nannulment thing?'
Rachel	 Uh-huh.'
Ross	 I\xc2\x92m not going to do that. (Rachel glares at him.)'

Rachel	 Okay! So, we\xc2\x92ll just stay married.'
Ross	 Yes, exactly!'
Rachel	 And I will make everyone call me Mrs. Geller!'
Ross	 Wow! This is so amazing. I uh, I really thought I\xc2\x92d have to talk you\ninto this more.'
Rachel	 Okay, see now I\xc2\x92m scared because I don\xc2\x92t actually think\nyou\xc2\x92re kidding.'
Ross	 I\xc2\x92m-I\xc2\x92m not kidding. Look I-I, I can\xc2\x92t have three\nfailed marriages. I can\xc2\x92t. Okay? I-I am not gonna be that guy!'
Rachel	 What-wh-what so we\xc2\x92ll just stay married forever?!'
Ross	 Okay, look, how is this gonna affect you? Really? I mean you fill some\nform out once and a while and instead of checking the box that says Ms you check the box\nthat says Mrs.! It\xc2\x92s right next to it!'
Rachel	 Ohh, okay, I\xc2\x92m sorry. You\xc2\x92re right. Y\xc2\x92know what? We\nabsolutely can stay married, because I was under the impression that the boxes were far away\nfrom each other. All right, look, just please, take a moment here and think about what\nyou\xc2\x92re asking of me.'
Ross	 I\xc2\x92m asking you to do me a favor. '
Rachel	 You are asking me to be your wife!'
Ross	 And as my wife I think you should grant me this favor.'
Monica	 That kid really kicked me hard on the plane.'
Chandler	 Well you did pull his hair.'
Monica	 He took my snack!'
Chandler	 I\xc2\x92m not getting into this again!'
Monica	 Okay! Oh God, y\xc2\x92know what? It\xc2\x92s really bad.'
Chandler	\xc2\xa0 Well, I told you not to walk. Here. (Picks her up.) There. Okay.\n(He opens the door, carries her across the threshold, stops, backs out, and lets go of\nMonica who is only holding on by his neck.)'
Monica	 This doesn\xc2\x92t mean anything, does it?'
Chandler	 No!'
Monica	 Okay.'
Phoebe	 (To Joey) How could you pick up a hitchhiker?! He could be a\nrape\xc2\x97(She holds her hand in front of the hitchhiker\xc2\x92s face), a rapist or a\nkiller or something!'
Joey	 Don\xc2\x92t you think I asked him that before he got in?!'
Phoebe	 Y\xc2\x92know what? I\xc2\x92m not talking to you! You go back to sleep! (To\nthe hitchhiker) And you, are you a rapist?!'
Hitchhiker	 No!'
Phoebe	 Do you like car games?'
Hitchhiker	 Yeah, y\xc2\x92know the license plate game?'
Phoebe	 I love the license plate game!'
Joey	 Ooh, I\xc2\x92ll play! I\xc2\x92ll play!'
Phoebe	 No-No! You need your sleep. Night-night! Shh! (She closes the\npartition.) '
Ross	 Hey!'
Rachel	 Hey!'
Ross	 Listen, I know you wanted to talk to me, but I have an idea that may make\nyou want to stay married. (Rachel shakes her head.) We register, and you get to\nkeep all the presents!'
Rachel	 (thinks about it for a second) No! Ross, come on! No! Listen, look I\nthought a lot about how to tell you this and the bottom line, Ross, is we can not stay\nmarried.'
Ross	 I don\xc2\x92t know if it\xc2\x92s true.'
Rachel	 Oh b-b-but it is!'
Ross	 Oh, okay, y\xc2\x92know what this is? This is a difference of\nopinion. And when that happens in a marriage...'
Rachel	 Oh Ross, come on! This is not, this is not a marriage!! This is the\nworld\xc2\x92s worst hangover! Ross, listen, if you do not get this annulment, I\nwill!'
Ross	 All right. All right, I\xc2\x92ll do it.'
Rachel	 Thank you. (He goes to leave.) Hey-hey umm, uh, is there, is there any\nsuch thing as an annulment shower?'
Hitchhiker	 Wait! Wait! There is the train station!'
Phoebe	 Oh, okay.'
Hitchhiker	 This is where I get off. Well, I have your address and phone number.'
Phoebe	 And I have your name and the fact that you\xc2\x92re a drifter, so the\nball\xc2\x92s pretty much in your court.'
Hitchhiker	 All right, see ya Pheebs. (Gets out and Phoebe drives away.)'
Joey	 Come on Pheebs! I can\xc2\x92t take this anymore! Let-let me make it up to\nyou. Huh? (Starts singing.) Ground control to Major Tom. Commencing countdown, engines\non. Take your protein pills and put your helmet on!'
Phoebe	 Stop it! Stop it no! That\xc2\x92s not fair! Y\xc2\x92know I can\xc2\x92t\nresist that beautiful voice!'
Joey	 Pheebs, I am so sorry! I know I promised you a fun road trip with your\nfriend and I didn\xc2\x92t deliver. But-but-but now I know that you think being awake is an\nimportant part of friendship! So, so, so I will strive to-to stay awake for as long as I\nknow you.'
Phoebe	 You can still sleep at night and stuff.'
Joey	 Well, thank you. So, can we play 20 Questions now? I\xc2\x92ve got a really\ngood one! I\xc2\x92ve been thinking about it since Kansas.'
Phoebe	 Okay. Is it a kind of hot sandwich?'
Joey	 Yes.'
Phoebe	 Is it a meatball sub?'
Joey	 That is incredible! You are the master!'
Rachel	 Huh, that\xc2\x92s funny. You look like you\xc2\x92re gonna be the\xc2\x85'
Monica	 No, don\xc2\x92t say it! Don\xc2\x92t even think it!'
Rachel	 All right. Okay Chandler, enjoy your handful. (Exits.)'
Chandler	 All right, should we just, should we just get married? Y\xc2\x92know? I\nmean should we just do it? All the signs are telling us to do it.'
Monica	 I\xc2\x92m sick of the signs! It\xc2\x92s too fast, I\xc2\x92m happy the way\nthings are!'
Chandler	 Me too!'
Monica	 I don\xc2\x92t want things to change! Do you?'
Chandler	 No!'
Monica	 All right then, then nothing changes! Everything is great! Everything\nstays the same! And you go unpack because it\xc2\x92s been three days and it\xc2\x92s driving\nme insane!'
Chandler	 Jeez, relax! It\xc2\x92s not like we\xc2\x92re mar-ah-ah!! (Runs out.)'
Chandler	 (entering, slowly) Y\xc2\x92know I was thinking, what if I uh, unpack\nhere?'
Monica	 Then all your stuff would be here.'
Chandler	 Well, what if all my stuff was here?'
Monica	 Then you\xc2\x92d be going back and forth all the time, I mean it\ndoesn\xc2\x92t make any sense.'
Chandler	 Okay. What if we lived together and you understand what I\xc2\x92m\nsaying?'
Monica	 Live together? There have been no signs for that.'
Chandler	 Me asking is kind of a sign.'
Monica	 YES!!!!!!!!'
Chandler	 Okay!!!!!'
Monica	 Yes! Okay! Okay! Wait-wait-wait!'
Chandler	 Okay.'
Monica	 Here\xc2\x92s your key (Gets him one.)'
Chandler	 Oh thanks.'
Monica	 Here\xc2\x92s your key. All right, you have to christen it! Now, go out\nand come back in!'
Chandler	 The door hasn\xc2\x92t been locked in five years, but okay! (Runs out.)\nReady?!'
Monica	 Ready!'
Chandler	 Okay, a little problem. The key broke in the lock and I can\xc2\x92t get\nin!'
Monica	 Wait! Oh my God! I can\xc2\x92t get out!'
Chandler	 This is not a sign!'
Monica	 No, it\xc2\x92s not a sign! It\xc2\x92s a very old key!'
Chandler	 It\xc2\x92s an old key!'
Monica	 Oh my God it\xc2\x92s old!'
Chandler	 I love you!'
Monica	 I love you!'
Chandler	 Are you hugging the door right now.'
Monica	 No.'
Chandler	 Yeah-yeah, me neither.'
Ross	 Hey!'
Rachel	 Hey, so did everything go all right with the annulment?'
Ross	 Oh, yeah, no problems. It\xc2\x92s all taken care of.'
Rachel	 Ross, thank you. Hey, do you guys wanna go see a movie?'
Ross	 Oh yeah, why not?'
Rachel	 Pheebs?'
Phoebe	 No thanks, I\xc2\x92ve already seen one.'
Rachel	 Okay, umm, I\xc2\x92m gonna get my sweater. (Walks away.)'
Ross	 Okay. (Sits down next to Phoebe.) You uh, you wanna hear something weird?'
Phoebe	 Always.'
Ross	 I didn\xc2\x92t get the annulment.'
Phoebe	 What?!'
Ross	 We\xc2\x92re still married! Don\xc2\x92t tell Rachel. See you later. (He gets\nup leaving Phoebe in shock.)'

Joey	 What are you doing?'
Chandler	 The key\xc2\x92s stuck in the lock.'
Joey	 I can fix it. Hold on. (He goes and gets a screwdriver from his apartment)\nLook out. Look out. (Pries at the door a little bit.)'
Chandler	 (trying the handle) It still doesn\xc2\x92t work.'
Joey	 I\xc2\x92m not finished.'
Chandler	 Oh.'
Chandler	 Nice job Joe! You\xc2\x92re quite the craftsmen.'
