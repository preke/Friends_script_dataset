Janice	 Janice has a question. Who of the six of you has sleep with the six of\nyou?'
Phoebe	 Wow, it\xc2\x92s like a dirty math problem.'
Ross	 I\xc2\x92m sorry the answer there would be...none of us.'
Janice	 Come on over the years none of you ever y'know, got drunk and stupid."
Joey	 Well, that\xc2\x92s really a different question.'
Janice	 I\xc2\x92m sorry I find it hard to believe that a group of people who\nspends as much time together as you guys do has never bumped uglies.'
Joey	 Well, there was that one time that Monica and Rachel got together.'
Monica and Rachel	 What?!!'
Rachel	 Excuse me, there was no time!'
Joey	 Okay, but let\xc2\x92s say there was. How might that go?'
Janice	 Okay, okay, well then answer me this. Has any of you ever.... almost?'
Rachel	 Does anybody need more coffee?'
Ross	 Yeah, I\xc2\x92ll take some.'
Joey	 Hey, there\xc2\x92s a dog out there!'

Phoebe	 Oh, that is so unfortunate.'
Ross	 What?'
Phoebe	 Cute naked guy is really starting to put on weight.'
Monica	 (entering from bedroom) Okay, I\xc2\x92ll be back in just a minute. Oh,\nPhoebe I\xc2\x92m sorry that I left lipstick marks on the phone.'
Phoebe	 You didn\xc2\x92t leave lipstick marks on the phone.'
Monica	 Oh, then it must\xc2\x92ve been you. Bye. (leaves)'
Phoebe	 (angrily) Bye-bye! (to Ross) That\xc2\x92s why I moved out.'
Ross	 Hey, y'know while we\xc2\x92re on that, when are you gonna tell my sister\nthat you don\xc2\x92t live here anymore."
Phoebe	 I think on some levels she already knows.'
Ross	 Phoebe, she doesn\xc2\x92t know that you sneak out every night, she\ndoesn\xc2\x92t know that you sneak back every morning, and she doesn\xc2\x92t know that\nyou\xc2\x92ve been living with your Grandmother\xc2\x92s for a week now.'
Phoebe	 Okay, well maybe not on those levels.'
Chandler	 (entering, with a goatee) Hey.'
Ross	 Hey.'
Chandler	 I\xc2\x92m never gonna find a roommate, ever.'
Phoebe	 Why, nobody good?'
Chandler	 Well let\xc2\x92s see, there was the guy with the ferrets, that\xc2\x92s\nplural. The spitter. Oh-ho, and yes, the guy that enjoyed my name so much he felt the need\nto make a little noise every time he said it. Nice to meet you, Chandler Bing Bing!\nGreat apartment Chandler Bing, Bing!'
Ross	 So how many more do you have tomorrow?'
Chandler	 Two. This photographer, who seemed really dull. And this actor guy,\nwho I\xc2\x92m not sure about, because when he called and I answered the phone\n\xc2\x91Chandler Bing,\xc2\x92 he said \xc2\x91Whoa-whoa, short message.\xc2\x92'
Monica	 (entering) Ross (who has his foot on the coffee table), foot on the\nfloor or come over no more!'
Ross	 (to Phoebe) Sure, your dresser is missing but this she notices.'
Monica	 What?'
Ross	 I have to go. Yeah, Carol should be home by now, soo...'
Chandler	 Umm, how\xc2\x92s it going with you guys?'
Ross	 Oh, better, actually. Y'know I-I-I think I finally figured out why we were\nhaving so much trouble lately."
Phoebe	 Oh, really?'
Ross	 Yeah, y'know how I have you guys, well she doesn\xc2\x92t really have any\nclose friends that are just hers, but last week she meet this woman at the gym, Susan\nsomething, and they really hit it off, and I-I-I think it\xc2\x92s gonna make a difference"
Chandler	 Soo, ah, Eric, what kind of photography do ya do?'
Eric	 Oh, mostly fashion, so there may be models here from time to time, I hope\nthat\xc2\x92s cool.'
Chandler	 Yes, that is cool. Because I have models here y'know......never."
Eric	 Oh, yeah, during the summer, I spend most weekends at my sister\xc2\x92s\nbeach house, which you are welcome to use by the way. Although, I should probably tell\nyou, she\xc2\x92s a porn star. (Chandler breaks his pencil in half)'
Chandler	 Well, listen I ah, still have one more person to ah meet, but unless\nit turns out to be your sister, I think you\xc2\x92re chances are pretty good. (Eric offers\nto shake hands) All right. (Chandler hugs him.)'
Chandler	 (running around the apartment pointing out things) Bedroom. Bathroom.\nLiving room. This right here is the kitchen, and thanks for coming by, (opens door)\nBye-bye.'
Joey	 Don\xc2\x92t you ah, don\xc2\x92t you wanna ask me any questions?'
Chandler	 Sure. Ummm. What\xc2\x92s up?'
Joey	 Well, ah, I\xc2\x92m an actor. I\xc2\x92m fairly neat. I ah, I got my own TV.\nOh, and don\xc2\x92t worry I\xc2\x92m totally okay with the gay thing.'
Chandler	 What gay thing?'
Joey	 Ah, y'know just in general people being gay, thing. I\xc2\x92m totally cool\nwith that."
Chandler	 Well okay Jerry, thanks for stopping by.'

Chandler	 Just coffee! Where are we gonna hang out now?'
Monica	 Got me.'

Waitress	 I am so sorry.'
Rachel	 That\xc2\x92s all right. (to her friends) I mean hard is it to get a\ncouple drinks right, huh?'
Friend No. 1	 Well, I would like to propose a toast to the woman, who in one\nyear from today, become Mrs. Dr. Barry Farber DDS'
Rachel	 Ummm, I think it\xc2\x92s time to see the ring again. (holds her hand out\nand they all scream)'
Friend No. 2	 Oh, isn\xc2\x92t it exciting, I mean it\xc2\x92s like having a\nboyfriend for life.'
Rachel	 Yeah, I know.'
Friend No. 1	 What?'
Rachel	 Oh, I don\xc2\x92t know. Well maybe it\xc2\x92s just the idea of Barry for\nthe rest of my life. I don\xc2\x92t know I think I feel like I need to have one last fling,\ny'know, just to sorta get it out of my system. (Chandler is listening in very intensely)"
Friend No. 1	 Rachel stop!'
Friend No. 2	 You\xc2\x92re so bad!'
Rachel	 I\xc2\x92m serious, I really, I think I need just to have\nsome...meaningless, sex y'know, with the next guy that I see."

Phoebe	 No, no, Mr. Heckles no one is making any noise up here.'
Mr. Heckles	 You\xc2\x92re disturbing my oboe practice.'
Phoebe	 You don\xc2\x92t play the oboe!'

Mr. Heckles	 I could be Chandler\xc2\x92s new roommate.'
Eric	 But, he told me over the phone.'
Mr. Heckles	 He told me in person.'
Eric	 That\xc2\x92s weird.'
Mr. Heckles	 Well, I\xc2\x92m going to go into my new apartment now. (goes over to\nthe door and opens it) Ehh! (Eric leaves)'

Monica	 Whoa! Are you okay?'
Joey	 Whew! Stood up to fast, got a little head rush.'
Monica	 It\xc2\x92s the heat. (has her hand on his chest, and then pulls it away)\nAnd-and the humidity.'
Joey	 That\xc2\x92s a uh, that\xc2\x92s a tough combination.'
Monica	 Do you wanna come in for some lemonade?'
Joey	 Like you wouldn\xc2\x92t believe. (they go into the apartment) Wow! This is\na great place.'
Monica	 Thank you. Just make yourself comfortable.'
Joey	 Gotcha.'
Monica	 This place is really my Grandmother\xc2\x92s. (Joey starts to take off all\nof his clothes, while Monica gets the glasses and pours the lemonade.) I got it from her\nwhen she moved to Florida, otherwise I could never afford a place like this. So if the\nlandlord ever asks, I\xc2\x92m 87 year old woman, who\xc2\x92s afraid of her VCR. So are you\nthirsty?'
Joey	 Oh, you bet I am!'
Monica	 (turning around) Okay, here\xc2\x92s your penis!'

Monica	 Oh my God!!! What are you doing?!!'
Joey	 You said, you wanna come in for some lemonade?'
Monica	 So?!'
Joey	 Whoa, ah!! We\xc2\x92re you just gonna give me some lemonade?'
Monica	 Yeah huh!! Cover yourself up!'
Joey	 Oh right, right.'
Monica	 I don\xc2\x92t believe this! When someone asks you in for lemonade, and to\nyou that means they wanna have sex?'
Joey	 Well usually...yeah! Well, not just lemonade, iced tea, sometimes juice.\nWell, sorry, I just, I thought you liked me. I\xc2\x92m such a jerk.'
Monica	 It\xc2\x92s okay. I suppose it could happen to anyone, not anyone I know,\nbut... By the way I can still see it.'
Monica	 Pheebs?'
Phoebe	 Huh?'
Monica	 Where\xc2\x92s your bed?'
Phoebe	 It\xc2\x92s not in the apartment? (Monica gives a \xc2\x91Come on\xc2\x92\nlook) Oh no. I can\xc2\x92t believe this is happening again.'
Monica	 What?'
Phoebe	 Okay, enough with the third degree! I-I\xc2\x92ve, I don\xc2\x92t live here\nanymore.'
Monica	 What are you talking about?'
Phoebe	 I\xc2\x92m sorry, I-I-I-I don\xc2\x92t live here anymore. I-I didn\xc2\x92t\nknow how to tell you, but y'know everybody else knows!"
Monica	 Everybody knows!'
Phoebe	 That was supposed to be a good thing, I forget why. Just listen, Monica,\nI, do you know, okay, do you know, I couldn\xc2\x92t sleep for like a month because I got\nlike a dot of ink on one of the sofa cushions. '
Monica	 Well, you-you coulda just turned the cushion over.'
Phoebe	 Yeah, I would\xc2\x92ve except I had a big spaghetti stain on the other\nside.'
Monica	 What?!?!'
Phoebe	 Okay, this is what I\xc2\x92m talking about, this. I-I need to live in a\nland where people can spill.'
Monica	 You can spill. In the sink.'
Phoebe	 Aw, honey it\xc2\x92s not your fault, y'know this is who you are, and I\nlove you, and I want us to be friends, and if I keep living here I don\xc2\x92t see that\nhappening."
Monica	 I love you, too. '
Phoebe	 Aww, good. (they hug) What?'
Monica	 What? I\xc2\x92m just said.'
Phoebe	 No you\xc2\x92re not, you\xc2\x92re wondering which cushion it is.'
Chandler	 So ah, whatcha watching?'
Joey	 Baywatch.'
Chandler	 What\xc2\x92s it about?'
Joey	 Lifeguards.'
Chandler	 Well, it sounds kinda stupid... (looks at the TV) Who\xc2\x92s she?'
Joey	 Nicole Eggert. You'll like her."
Chandler	 Wow! Look at them run.'
Joey	 They do that a lot. Hey, you want a beer?'
Chandler	 Yeah, I\xc2\x92ll go get one.'
Joey	 No, no, no, don\xc2\x92t get up, I got a cooler right here.'
Chandler	 Well, hello!'
Monica	 Hey.'
Chandler	 Do you have any beers? We\xc2\x92re out of beers.'
Monica	 (all depressed) Help yourself.'
Chandler	 You okay?'
Monica	 Phoebe moved out.'
Chandler	 Right.'
Monica	 I don\xc2\x92t understand, I mean am I so hard to live, is this why I\ndon\xc2\x92t have a boyfriend?'
Chandler	 Noo!! You don\xc2\x92t have a boyfriend because....I don\xc2\x92t, I\ndon\xc2\x92t know why you don\xc2\x92t have a boyfriend. You should have a boyfriend.'
Monica	 Well, I think so.'
Chandler	 Oh-ho, come here. (goes and hugs her) Listen, you are one of my\nfavourite people and the most beautiful woman I\xc2\x92ve ever known in real life.'
Ross	 (all depressed) Hi. Where is everybody?'
Phoebe	 Oh, it\xc2\x92s already closed, Chris gave me the keys to lock up-what is\nwrong?'
Ross	 My marriage, I think my marriage is um, is kinda over.'
Phoebe	 Oh no! Why?'
Ross	 \xc2\x91Cause Carol\xc2\x92s a lesbian. (Phoebe is shocked) And, and I\xc2\x92m\nnot one. And apparently it\xc2\x92s not a mix and match situation.'
Phoebe	 Oh my God! I don\xc2\x92t believe it! Oh, you poor bunny.'
Ross	 (sets out a bunch of shot glasses and starts to poor himself a drink, many\ndrinks) I\xc2\x92m an idiot. I mean shoulda seen it, I mean Carol and I\xc2\x92d be out and\nshe\xc2\x92d, she\xc2\x92d see some beautiful woman, and, and she\xc2\x92d be Ross y'know look\nat her, and I\xc2\x92d think, God, my wife is cool!"
Phoebe	 Aw! Hey, do you think that Susan person is her lover?'
Ross	 Well, now I do!!'
Phoebe	 I\xc2\x92m sorry.'
Ross	 Seven years. I mean we\xc2\x92ve been together seven years, she\xc2\x92s the\nonly woman who\xc2\x92s ever loved me, and the only woman I\xc2\x92ve-I\xc2\x92ve ever....'
Phoebe	 Aw, God Ross. Oh.(goes over and hugs him)'
Chandler	 Umm, this is nice.'
Monica	 I know, it is isn\xc2\x92t it?'
Chandler	 No, I mean it, this feels really good. Is it a hundred percent cotton?'
Monica	 Yeah! And I got it on sale, too.'
Chandler	 Anyway, I should go, one of the lifeguards was just about to dismantle\na nuclear device.'
Monica	 Well, if you wanna get a drink later we can.'
Chandler	 Oh yeah, that sounds great. (starts to leave) Oh, and listen,\nit\xc2\x92s, it\xc2\x92s gonna be....'
Monica	 I know. Thanks. (Chandler leaves)'
Ross	 Maybe this would\xc2\x92ve happened if I\xc2\x92d been more nurturing, or\nI\xc2\x92d paid more attention, or I... had a uterus. I can\xc2\x92t believe this!'
Phoebe	 I know no, no, y'know you don\xc2\x92t deserve this, you don\xc2\x92t Ross.\nYou\xc2\x92re, you\xc2\x92re really, you\xc2\x92re so good. (kisses him on the cheek)"
Ross	 Thanks.'
Phoebe	 And you\xc2\x92re so sweet. (kisses him on the other cheek) And\nyou\xc2\x92re kind (kisses him on the lips)'
Ross	 Thanks. (kisses her on the lips)'
Ross	 Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.'
Phoebe	 Huh?'
Phoebe	 Okay, it\xc2\x92s okay.'
Phoebe	 Oh. (they start kissing again)'
Ross	 Wait, wait, wait.'
Phoebe	 What?'
Ross	 My foot is stuck in the pocket.'
Phoebe	 What?'
Ross	 No, I can\xc2\x92t get it out.'
Phoebe	 Well, that\xc2\x92s not something a girl wants to hear.'
Ross	 No, come on don\xc2\x92t start. (they start kissing again) Ouch!'
Phoebe	 What?'
Ross	 Stupid balls are in the way. (holds up two balls)'
Ross	 Oh well. It probably would\xc2\x92ve been the most constructive solution.'
Phoebe	 You have chalk on your face.'
Ross	 Huh? (the rest of the gang enters)'
Phoebe	 Oh, Ross you\xc2\x92re right, I don\xc2\x92t know why I always thought this\nwas real grass.'
Monica	 Hey, are you okay?'
Ross	 My wife\xc2\x92s a lesbian.'
Joey	 Cool!!'
Chandler	 Ross-Joey, Joey-Ross. (they shake hands)'
Ross	 Hi.'

Chandler	 I can\xc2\x92t believe you came back.'
Rachel	 Don\xc2\x92t say anything. I don\xc2\x92t wanna speak, I don\xc2\x92t wanna\nthink. I just want you to take me and kiss me and make love to me right here, right now.'
Friend No. 2	 Rachel! Rachel! (stirs Rachel from her dream, she\xc2\x92s in her\ncar driving back from the city)'
Rachel	 What?'
Friend No. 2	 You missed the exit!'
Rachel	 Oh, sorry.'

Her Friends	 Awwww!!'
