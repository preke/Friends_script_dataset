Monica	 (In a sexy voice) Come in. I've been waiting for you. "
Rachel	 Hi! I just wanna-(sees Monica)-Ahhh!!! Oh my God! (She runs out in\nhorror.) Oh my God!'
Monica	 (pulling on a robe) Okay, I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I-I-I was um, I was\ntaking a nap."
Rachel	 Since when do take naps in that position. Oh God Monica, tell me\nyou were waiting for a guy! Please tell me you were waiting for a guy!'
Monica	 Yes. Yes, I was. A guy. From work. (Thinks) I'm seeing a guy from work!\nHa!"
Rachel	 (Gasps) That cute waiter guy from your restaurant, the one that looks\nlike a non-threatening Ray Liotta?'
Monica	 Uh-huh, that one!'
Rachel	 Y'know what, just give me a second and I'll be out of your hair. I'm\njust gonna grab a jacket. When I get back, I want every little detail. (There's a knock on\nthe door.) Maybe that's him. (Goes to answer the door.)"
Monica	 (Panicking) Okay, umm, okay, umm\xc2\x85 (Rachel opens the door.) It's\njust Joey and Ross."
Rachel	 Why aren't you guys at the movie?"
Joey	 Well, we were! But Ross was talking so loud on his phone they threw us\nout!'
Ross	 I had to talk loud because the movie was loud!'
Joey	 (to Monica and Rachel) He's talking to London!"
Monica	 But why?! Did he get in touch with Emily?'
Joey	 Well no, not yet. He's calling everyone on her side of the family hoping\nthat someone will help him get in touch with her."
Ross	 (on phone) I-I-I don't care if I said some other girl's name you prissy,\nold twit!"
Joey	 Ross! Way to suck up to the family.'
Chandler	 (entering, happily, with a bottle of champagne, thinking that Monica\nis the only one there) Ha-ha-ha-(sees everyone)-enh-enh. I'm so glad you guys are all\nhere! My office finally got wrinkle free fax paper!"

Joey	 (entering, wearing a tux) Hey!'
Chandler	 Oh no-no-no-no-no-no, vomit tux! No-no, vomit tux!'
Joey	 Don't worry, I had it dry-cleaned."
Monica	 Vomit tux? Who vomited on\xc2\x97y'know what, what you up to Joe?"
Joey	 Well, I'm doing this telethon thing on TV and my agent got me a job as\nco-host!"
Monica	 Oh that's great!"
Joey	 A little uh, good deed for PBS and a little TV exposure, now that's the\nkind of math Joey likes to do!"
Phoebe	 Ugh, PBS!'
Monica	 What's wrong with PBS?"
Phoebe	 Ugh, what's right with them?"
Joey	 Why don\xc2\x92t you like PBS, Pheebs?'
Phoebe	 Okay, 'cause right after my mom killed herself, I was just in this\nreally bad place, y'know personally. So, I just thought that it'd make me feel better if I\nwrote to Sesame Street, 'cause they were so nice when I was a little kid! No one\never wrote back."
Chandler	 Well y'know a lot of those Muppets don't have thumbs."
Phoebe	 All I got was a lousy key chain! And by that time I was living in a box.\nI didn't have keys!"
Joey	 I'm sorry Pheebs, I just, y'know, I just wanted to do a good deed.\nLike-like you did with the babies."
Phoebe	 This isn't a good deed, you just wanted to get on TV! This is totally\nselfish."
Joey	 Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What about you, having those babies for your brother?\nTalk about selfish!'
Phoebe	 What-what are you talking about?!'
Joey	 Well, yeah, it was a really nice thing and all, but it made you feel\nreally good right?'
Phoebe	 Yeah. So?'
Joey	 It made you feel good, so that makes it selfish. Look, there's no\nunselfish good deeds, sorry."
Phoebe	 Yes there are! There are totally good deeds that are selfless.'
Joey	 Well, may I ask for one example?'
Phoebe	 Yeah, it's\xc2\x85 Y'know there's\xc2\x97no you may not!"
Joey	 That's because all people are selfish."
Phoebe	 Are you calling me selfish?!'
Joey	 Are you calling you people? (Chandler rolls his eyes.) Yeah, well sorry to\nburst that bubble, Pheebs, but selfless good deeds don't exist. Okay? And you the deal on\nSanta Clause right?"
Phoebe	 I'm gonna find a selfless good dead. I'm gonna beat you, you evil\ngenius."
Ross	 (on phone) Hello.'
Emily	 (on phone from London) Hello, Ross?'
Ross	 Emily? Emily! Oh my God! Oh my God, it's Emily! (He picks up a lamp and\nhands it to Chandler, for no reason.) It's Emily everyone! Shush-shush-shhst! (to Emily)\nHi!"
Emily	 Ross, I'm only ringing to say stop harassing my relatives. Good-bye!"
Ross	 No wait! Look, wait! Okay, you can hang up, but I'm gonna keep calling!\nI'm gonna, I'm gonna call everyone in England if that's what it takes to get you to talk\nto me!"
Emily	 Really? About what?'
Ross	 Look you're my wife. We're-we're married. Y'know? I-I love you. I-I really\nmiss you."
Emily	 I miss you to. Well, at least I think I do.'
Ross	 (to the gang, whispering) She's talking."
All	 (subdued) Yay! (He motions for them to keep quiet, including Chandler who\nis still holding the lamp Ross handed him, before he goes off to talk to Emily in\nprivate.)'
Phoebe	 Hey, Joey, when you said the deal with Santa Clause, you meant?'
Joey	 That he doesn't exist."
Phoebe	 Right. (She turns and opens her eyes in shock.)'
Rachel	 So Chandler, have you heard about Monica's secret boyfriend?"
Chandler	 Uhh, yeah. She uh, she uh, she uh might've mentioned him."
Rachel	 So Mon, when are we gonna meet this new secret waiter man?'
Monica	 Ohh, he's really shy. I-I don\xc2\x92t think he's up to meeting everyone\nyet."
Chandler	 Yeah, I don't think he's up to meeting everyone yet."
Rachel	 I don\xc2\x92t care! I wanna meet this guy who's the best sex she ever\nhad!"
Chandler	 Really?! That's what you heard? (To Monica) You said that?"
Monica	 I might've said that. (Chandler laughs.) Why is that funny?"
Chandler	 Because I'm very happy for him! (To Monica) And you, you lucky\ndog!"
Ross	 (entering) Hi!'
Monica	 Hey!'
Ross	 Well, Emily's willing to work on the relationship."
Chandler	 Yes!'
Monica	 That's great!"
Ross	 In London!'
Monica	 What?!'
Ross	 She wants me to move to London.'
Monica	 But you live here! (Ross rolls his eyes.) You know that.'
Rachel	 What-what-what are you gonna do?'
Ross	 I bet if I talk to Carol and Susan I can convince them to move to London\nwith Ben.'
Monica	 Yeah, I'm sure your ex-wife will be more than happy to move to another\ncountry so you can patch things up with your new wife."
Ross	 It could happen.'
Joey	 (To the pledge volunteers) How ya doin'? Welcome. Good to see ya!"
Stage Director	 This will be your phone.'
Joey	 That's great. But uh, I'm not really expecting a lot of calls."
Stage Director	 No you answer it and take pledges.'
Joey	 But I'm the host!"
Stage Director	 No, Gary Collins is the host. You'll be answering the phones."
Joey	 You don't seem to understand. See, I was Dr. Drake Remoray."
Stage Director	 Well, here's your phone doctor. (She walks away.)"
Phoebe	 I cannot believe I can't find a selfless good deed! Y'know that old guy\nthat lives next to me? Well, I snuck over there and-and raked up all the leaves on his\nfront stoop. But he caught me and force-fed me cider and cookies. Then I felt wonderful.\nThat old jackass!"
Rachel	 Maybe Joey's right. Maybe all good deeds are selfish."
Phoebe	 I will find a selfless good deed! 'Cause I just gave birth to three\nchildren and I will not let them be raised in a world where Joey is right!"
Chandler	 (entering) Hey, Monica? Can I ask you a cooking question?'
Monica	 Sure!'
Chandler	 If you're cooking on the stove, does that mean that your new secret\nboyfriend is better in bed than Richard?"
Rachel	 Chandler! (Pause) Is he?'
Monica	 Well, y'know I-I-I think I'm gonna respect the privacy of my new secret\nboyfriend."
Chandler	 Why?! I mean if this guy was me and it was me who had\nlearned that it was me who was the best you'd ever had, I'd be going like this. (He\njumps up onto the table and starts doing his happy dance.)"
Ross	 All right Emily, as much as I love you, I'm sorry, I can't move to London\nwithout Ben."
Emily	 I understand that would be difficult.'
Ross	 Yeah, would you please consider moving here? I mean you were gonna\nmove here anyway, why can't you just do that?"
Emily	 I don't know, it's just\xc2\x85"
Ross	 Oh-oh-okay, but-but I know, that even though I've been a-a complete\nidiot up 'til now, I mean, I mean you-you-you have to come here. You have to come here so\nwe can work this out."
Emily	 All right.'
Ross	 All right, did you just say all right?'
Emily	 I did. Now I'm the idiot."
Ross	 Oh, Emily that is, that is so great. It's gonna be so great! We're gonna\nbe like-like-like two idiots in love!"
Emily	 Ross, there's one thing that really scares me still."
Ross	 Yes, tell me.'
Emily	 Well, you have to understand how humiliating it was for me up on that\naltar in front of my entire family, all my friends.'
Ross	 I know. I am, I am so sorry.'
Emily	 And then after decided to forgive you, seeing you at the airport catching\nour plane with her.'
Ross	 Again, very sorry.'
Emily	 I mean, I can't-I can't be in the same room as her! It drives me mad just\nthinking of you being in the same room as her!"
Ross	 Emily, there is nothing between Rachel and me. Okay? I love you.'
Emily	 All right. I'll come to New York and we'll try and make this work."
Ross	 Oh that is so great! That's\xc2\x85"
Emily	 (interrupting him) As long as you don't see Rachel anymore."

Ross	 So I asked Emily if she would come to New York, and she said yes.'
Chandler	 Yes!'
Phoebe	 Ooh-ohh!'
Monica	 Great!'
Ross	 No-no-no! Only if I promise never to see Rachel again.'
Phoebe	 Why?'
Monica	 What?! You can't\xc2\x97what did you tell her?"
Ross	 I told her I'd have to think about it. I mean, how the hell am I supposed\nto make this kind of a decision? (They're all quiet.) I'm actually asking you!"
Chandler	 Well, you can't just not see Rachel anymore, she's one of your best\nfriends."
Monica	 Yeah! But, he can't not exactly see Emily, I mean that's his wife."
Phoebe	 Yeah.'
Chandler	 That's true!"
Phoebe	 Yeah, but you've known Rachel since High School and you cannot just cut\nher out of your life."
Chandler	 That's true!"
Monica	 No, you cannot.'
Ross	 Thanks for the help, problem solved. (Wipes his hands.)'
Monica	 (answering it) Hello.'
Joey	 (on phone) Hey Mon!'
Monica	 Oh hey Joey! We've been watching all day, when are you gonna be on TV?"
Joey	 See, there was kind of a mix up in my agent's office, but I'm still on TV\nand that's good exposure. "
Monica	 (Looking at the TV) You're not on TV."
Joey	 Oh, uh, okay, how, how about now? (He waves his hand in front of the woman\nnext to him and you can now see his arm on TV.)'
Chandler	 Hey, there he is! There he is!'
Joey	 Hello New York! (The woman bats his hand out of the way.)'
Emeril	 (on TV.) Now maybe you just like wanna but the whole duck in there! Who\ncares, y'know? Now I got the legs\xc2\x85"
Chandler	 How many times have I told you guys, you never watch the\ncooking channel!'
Monica	 (entering) Hi Chandler.'
Chandler	 Hey!'
Monica	 Uh, listen, I need that broiling pan that Joey borrowed the other day.'
Chandler	 Oh that was yours? Uh, yeah, we used it when the duck was throwing up\ncaterpillars. '
Monica	 William Sonoma, fall catalog, Page 27.'
Chandler	 Expect it in 4-6 weeks. (She starts to leave.) Umm, hey, umm, Joey's\ngonna be at the telethon for the rest of the day, we have the whole place to ourselves."
Monica	 Yeah, so?'
Chandler	 Well I just, thought maybe you'd wanna book some time with the best\nyou'd ever had."
Monica	 Y'know what, champ? I think I'll pass."
Chandler	 Why?'
Monica	 Why? (She hops into the living room and imitates Chandler's happy\ndance.)"
Chandler	 What's your point?"
Joey	 (in a bored voice) PBS telethon.'
Phoebe	 (on phone from Central Perk) Hey Joey, I just wanted to let you know\nthat I found a selfless good deed. I just went down to the park and I let a bee sting me.'
Joey	 What?! What good is that gonna do anybody?'
Phoebe	 Well, it helps the bee look tough in front of his bee friends. The bee\nis happy and I am definitely not.'
Joey	 Now, y'know the bee probably died after he stung ya."
Phoebe	 (Thinks for a moment.) Aw, dammit! (Slams the phone down.)'
Stage Director	 Back on in 30 seconds people!'
Joey	 Hey, excuse me, would you mind switching with me?'
PBS Volunteer	 Hey, no way, I'm in the shot man."
Joey	 Come on man! You've been here all day!"
PBS Volunteer	 Yeah, I-I'm taking pledges here, eh?"
Stage Director	 We're on in 3, 2, (points to Gary Collins.)"
Gary Collins	 Welcome back to our fall telethon. Now if you've been enjoying the\nperformance of Cirque Du Soleil, (As he is speaking, Joey and the volunteer\ngetting into a shoving match.) and you'd like to see more of the same kind of programming,\nit's very simple. All you have to do (Joey is knocked down.) is call in your pledge and at\nthat time tell the operator, one of our volunteers, what kind of programming you'd like\nto\xc2\x85 (Just as the volunteer sits down, Joey pulls him to the ground.)"
Ross	 (entering) Okay, that's it. I cannot make this decision! It is too\ndifficult, so I'm just gonna leave it entirely to the gods of fate. (He holds up and\nstarts shaking a\xc2\x85)"
Monica	 A Magic Eight ball?! You can't be serious, you can't make this decision\nwith a toy!"
Phoebe	 Ooh, it's not a toy."
Ross	 Well, I don't know what else to do. I mean, I either keep my wife and lose\none of my-my-my best friends or I keep my friend and get divorced the second time before\nI'm 30! So-so if anyone has-has a better suggestion, let's hear it! 'Cause I-I got\nnothing! All right, don't be shy, any suggestion will do. (There are none.) Okay then.\nHere we go. Magic 8 Ball, should I never see Rachel again? (He turns it over and reads the\nanswer) Ask again later. Later is not good enough. (He shakes it up again and reads the\nanswer.) Ask again later. What the hell! This is broken! It-it is broken!"
Monica	 All right, let me see. (She grabs the 8 ball.) Will Chandler have sex\ntonight? (Reads the answer.) Don't count on it. Seems like it works to me."
Joey	 (in an unenthusiastic voice) PBS Telethon.'
Phoebe	 (on phone) Hi Joey.'
Joey	 Hey Pheebs!'
Phoebe	 I would like to make a pledge. I would like to donate $200.'
Joey	 $200? Are you sure Pheebs? I mean, after what Sesame Street did to\nya?'
Phoebe	 Oh, I'm still mad at them but I also now that they bring happiness to\nlots of kids who's moms didn't kill themselves, so by supporting them, I'm doing a good\nthing, but I'm not happy about it. So there, a selfless good deed."
Joey	 And you don't a little good about donating the money?"
Phoebe	 No, it sucks. I was saving up to buy a hamster.'
Joey	 A hamster? What, those things are like 10 bucks.'
Phoebe	 Yeah, not the one I had my eye on.'
Gary Collins	 (on TV.) It looks like we have surpassed last year's pledge total!\nThank you viewers! The pledge that did it was taken by one of our volunteers\xc2\x85(He\nwalks over to where Joey is sitting.) Oh boy! And may I say one of our sharpest dressed\nvolunteers, (Joey stands up.) Mr. Joseph Tribbiani!"
Phoebe	 Oh, look-look, Joey's on TV! Isn't that great? My pledge got Joey on TV!\nOh that makes me feel\xc2\x97Oh no! (Realizes that her deed made her happy and therefore\nit's selfish and covers her mouth in horror.)"
Chandler	 (entering) Look, maybe I got carried away before. But there's\nsomething you gotta know. If I'm the best, it's only because you've made me the best."
Monica	 Keep talking.'
Chandler	 I mean I was nothing before you. Call the other girls and ask. Which\nwouldn't take long. But when I'm with you, and we're together, OH\xc2\x85MY\xc2\x85GOD."
Monica	 Really?'
Chandler	 Oh-aw my God! Now, I understand if you never want to sleep with me\nagain, but that would be wrong. We're too good! We owe it, to sex!"
Monica	 Well, if we owe it? (She throws down her cleaning stuff and jumps into\nhis arms.) Oh my\xc2\x85 When is Joey gonna be home?'
Chandler	 Well, I was kinda hoping we could do this without him. (She starts to\ntake off her latex gloves.) Oh no-no-no, leave the gloves on.'
Monica	 But, I just cleaned the bathroom.'
Chandler	 Yeah, why don't we lose the gloves."
Monica	 Yeah. (She takes them off.)'
Chandler	 All right, let's show them how it's done."
Monica	 Okay.'
Monica	 Ow!'
Chandler	 Y'know that wasn't part of it?"
Monica	 I know!'
Rachel	 (entering) Hi! Are you ready? We're gonna be late!"
Ross	 For what?'
Rachel	 For Stella! Remember? She's gettin' her grove back in like 20 minutes."
Ross	 Yeah, I uh, totally forgot about that. You mind if I take a rain check?\nI'm waiting for a call from Emily."
Rachel	 Sure. I guess. Hey, I hear you don't have to go to London. Yay!"
Ross	 It's not that easy, there's still a lot of relationship stuff."
Rachel	 Like what?'
Ross	 Just stuff. Y'know kinda what Emily wants."
Rachel	 Well, why don't you talk to me about it, maybe I can help."
Ross	 No. No. You-you can't help. I mean, I kinda have to do this without your\nhelp."
Rachel	 Well, I-I know you can do that too. I'm just, I'm just saying if you\nneed somebody to talk to\xc2\x85 Hi!"
Ross	 Thanks.'
Rachel	 Ross? Look, whatever this relationship stuff that Emily wants, just give\nit to her. Come on, the bottom line here is that you love her. So just fix whatever she\nwants fixed. Just do it. (The phone starts ringing.) I mean, you're gonna have to\ntry. You'll just gonna hate yourself if you don't. (The phone keeps ringing.) Oh come on\nanswer it! It's driving me crazy!"
Ross	 (answering the phone.) Hello. (Listens) Hi sweetie. (Listens.) Good. Look\numm, yes I've been thinking about that thing that you wanted me to do and, I can do it.\n(Rachel gives him a thumbs up.) So will you come to New York? (Rachel wants to know what\nshe said, and he gives her a thumbs up and she goes over and hugs him. All the time not\nknowing what's going on.)"

Monica	 Never done that before.'
Chandler	 Nope.'
