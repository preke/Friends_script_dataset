Gunther	 Here you go.'
Rachel	 Thank you.'
Gunther	 (In his head) Say Rachel, I was wondering if you\xc2\x92d like to go\nto a movie with me sometime. As my lover! Nnnsch, to out there. Maybe you\xc2\x92d just like\nto ah, get something to eat with me sometime? As my lover.'
Mark	 (entering) Hi!'
Rachel	 Hi! All right, let\xc2\x92s go shoppin\xc2\x92!!'
Mark	 Um, y'know, before we go ah, there\xc2\x92s something I need to say."
Rachel	 Oh, okay.'
Mark	 I\xc2\x92ve kinda of had this ah, this crush on you. (Rachel is shocked) But\nsince you were with Ross, I-I didn\xc2\x92t do anything about it. But, now that you\xc2\x92re\nnot, I\xc2\x92d really like to ask you out sometime. So-so that\xc2\x92s-that\xc2\x92s what\nI\xc2\x92m doing, now.'
Rachel	 Wow! Umm....'
Gunther	 I dropped a cup.'

Pete	 ...so y'know, that\xc2\x92s why, within a few years, that voice recognition\nis gonna be pretty much standard on any computer you buy. Y'know, so you could be\nlike-like, \xc2\x91Wash my car.\xc2\x92 \xc2\x91Clean my room.\xc2\x92 It\xc2\x92s not gonna be able\nto do any of those things, but it\xc2\x92ll understand what you\xc2\x92re saying."
Monica	 Oh, this is so great.'
Pete	 Yeah, it was.'
Monica	 All right then. (He leans in to kiss her goodnight, but she quickly\nkisses him on the cheek and pats his shoulder.) Bye.'
Monica	 Hello, people who do not live here.'
All	 Hi! Hello!'
Monica	 I gave you a key for emergencies!'
Phoebe	 We were out of Doritos.'
Ross	 Hey, how\xc2\x92d the date go with Mr. Millionaire?'
Chandler	 Mr. Millionaire, new from Snooty Playthings! Third wife sold\nseparately.'
Monica	 He\xc2\x92s great! I mean we have such a good time together! He\xc2\x92s so\nfunny, and sooo sweet, and I\xc2\x92m not attracted to him at all!!'
Ross	 Still?!'
Monica	 Noo!! It\xc2\x92s driving me crazy. I mean every other way he\xc2\x92s like\nthe perfect guy, he has everything. Plus! He actually has everything.'
Chandler	 Life-sized Imperial Storm Troopers from Sharper Image?'
Monica	 Two.'
Chandler	 Wow!! Can Joey and I put them on and fight?'
Joey	 (entering, dancing and singing) Oh mommie, oh daddie, I am a big old\nbaddie! Oh mommie, oh daddie, I am a big old baddie! (He dances around the dinner table\nand exits)'
Ross	 I guess he musta gotten the part in that play.'
Monica and Phoebe	 Oh.'
Chandler	 Yeah, either that, or Gloria Estefan was right, eventually, the rhythm\nis going to get you.'
The Director	 Joe. How\xc2\x92s it going?'
Joey	 Good. (He sets his stuff down and starts talking to Kate, another cast\nmember.) Hey.'
Kate	 Hi.'
Joey	 Oh, so you\xc2\x92re playing Adrienne, huh?'
Kate	 Yes. Are you one of the retarded cousins?'
Joey	 Oh, no. Ah, I playing your husband, Victor. I\xc2\x92m Joey Tribianni.'
Kate	 Hi, nice to meet you. Kate Miller. '
Joey	 So the ah, play\xc2\x92s pretty great, huh?'
Kate	 Oh, yeah. I love Jennifer Van Murray\xc2\x92s work. She\xc2\x92s so\nbrilliantly incisive when it comes to deconstructing the psyche of the American middle\nclass.'
Joey	 Oh, forget about it. She rocks!'
Kate	 Where do I know you from?'
Joey	 Dr. Drake Remoray. Days of Our Lives. Voted most datable\nneurosurgeon by Teen Beat.'
Kate	 No, that\xc2\x92s not it. So, you\xc2\x92re a soap actor? Well this must be\npretty exciting for you to be in a real play, hmm?'
Joey	 Hey, I\xc2\x92ve done plays before. I\xc2\x92m a serious actor.'
Kate	 That info-mercial! For the milk carton spout thing!\nYou\xc2\x92re-you\xc2\x92re-you\xc2\x92re the guy that doesn\xc2\x92t know how to pour milk!!'
Joey	 See, I actually can pour milk, but I got you believing that I\ncouldn\xc2\x92t. Now, see, that\xc2\x92s acting.'
Kate	 Right, at the end, you choked on a cookie.'
Joey	 Yeah, that was real.'
Phoebe	 Wow! I cannot believe Mark asked you out.'
Rachel	 I know.'
Phoebe	 What, so what are you gonna tell him?'
Rachel	 Well, I told him I would think about it, but I\xc2\x92m gonna tell him no.'
Phoebe	 Huh.'
Rachel	 I mean I think I\xc2\x92d say no to anybody right now. (Hearing this\nGunther swoops back to cleaning tables.) Oh, but it was so strange. I mean I\xc2\x92m\nstanding there with this charming, cute guy, who\xc2\x92s asking me to go out with him,\nwhich I\xc2\x92m allowed to do, and I felt guilty. Y'know, like I\xc2\x92d be cheating on Ross\nor something."
Phoebe	 Wow. So, okay, maybe that means that, you\xc2\x92re not over Ross yet and\nyou have issues with your father.'
Rachel	 I don\xc2\x92t have any issues with my Father.'
Phoebe	 Okay, so it\xc2\x92s probably just the Ross thing then.'
Joey	 I hate this woman!! I hate her! She told everyone in the company about\nthat info-mercial, and now they all keep asking me to open their drinks. Okay, and\nwhenever I can\xc2\x92t do it, they\xc2\x92re all like-like laughing at me.'
Ross	 (entering) Hello.'
Chandler and Joey	 Hey!'
Ross	 So Rachel called. Wants to see me. Going over in a minute.'
Joey	 Wow, what-what do you think she wants?'
Ross	 Well, maybe the crazy fog has lifted and she realises that life without\nme.... a-sucks.'
Chandler	 It\xc2\x92s possible. You are very loveable, I\xc2\x92d miss you if I\nbroke up with you. (Ross glares at him) I was just trying to be supportive.'
Ross	 Then be supportive like a guy.'
Chandler	 (in a deep voice) If I broke up with you, I\xc2\x92d miss you.'
Ross	 Hi.'
Rachel	 Hi!'
Ross	 You ah, wanted to see me?'
Rachel	 Yeah. Ahh, here\xc2\x92s a box of your stuff. (hands him a box)'
Ross	 What?!'
Rachel	 Oh, y'know, it\xc2\x92s just like hats, and a shirt, and CD\xc2\x92s, just\nsort of stuff that you\xc2\x92ve left here."
Ross	 What are you doing? Are you trying to hurt me? Or something?'
Rachel	 No. Ross, it, it just seems that y'know it\xc2\x92s time we-we y'know,\nmove on. I mean, I mean don\xc2\x92t\xc2\x92 you think?"
Ross	 Yes. '
Rachel	 Yeah?'
Ross	 Yes, I do.'
Rachel	 Good.'
Ross	 Yeah, I-I really do. (takes a dinosaur mug out of the box) Hey! This-this\nwas a gift?!'
Rachel	 Ross, you got that for free from the museum gift shop.'
Ross	 It\xc2\x92s still a gift! I got it from the gift shop!'
Rachel	 Okay, all right, give me the mug! I\xc2\x92ll keep the mug.'
Ross	 No!! Y'know-y'know don\xc2\x92t do me any favours. In fact, where,\nwhere\xc2\x92s the rest of my stuff?! Huh? Like-like my umm, (picks up a book) Hey, this\nbook is mine!! And-and-and, and that T-shirt you sleep in? I\xc2\x92d like that back too.\nYes, I do."
Rachel	 You know how much I love that T-shirt! You never even where that\nT-shirt!'
Ross	 I\xc2\x92m just trying to help you, move on.'
Rachel	 Oh, you are a petty man. You are a petty, petty....'
Ross	 Petty...'
Rachel	 Petty... (goes into her room)'
Ross	 Petty...'
Rachel	 Petty...'
Ross	 Petty...'
Rachel	 Small...'
Ross	 Small... (Rachel comes back into the living room and catches Ross mocking\nher.)'
Rachel	 You are so just doing this out of spite.'
Ross	 Awwwahuh, no, no, no!!'
Rachel	 Huh?'
Ross	 I\xc2\x92m-I\xc2\x92m gonna wear this all the time! I love this shirt!! (he\nkisses the shirt)'
Rachel	 You have not worn that T-shirt since you were 15!! It doesn\xc2\x92t even\nfit you anymore!'
Ross	 Oh, yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah...'
Rachel	 (imitating him) yeah-yeah-yeah!!'
Ross	 Oh-oh, okay, okay! (He quickly takes off his sweater in order to put on\nthe T-shirt. It\xc2\x92s an old \xc2\x91Frankie says relax\xc2\x92 T-shirt, that barely fits\nhim. Rachel nods her head in approval of the new look.) If you don\xc2\x92t mind I\xc2\x92m\ngonna the rest of my stuff, and relax, in my favourite shirt. (Starts to leave) You have a\npleasant evening. (He exits and leaves the door open.)'
Phoebe	 So, you\xc2\x92re like a zillionaire? (Pete smiles and nods)'
Chandler	 And you\xc2\x92re our age. You\xc2\x92re our age.'
Phoebe	 Y'know what, you should like, you should buy a state and then just name\nit after yourself."
Pete	 What like Pete Dakota?'
Phoebe	 Yeah, or, or, or, Mississ-Pete.'
Joey	 Oh, oh, I got it! Pete-Chicago.'
Chandler	 That\xc2\x92s not a state Joe.'
Joey	 Oh, and Mississ-Pete is?'
Pete	 I got to go, so ah, I\xc2\x92ll see you guys later.'
All	 Okay.'
Chandler	 You\xc2\x92re our age!'
Pete	 (to Monica, by the door) So ah, we on for tomorrow?'
Monica	 Absolutely! (He goes to kiss her, but she stops him and rubs his head\nand says...) Now get out of here you!! (Pete leaves) (to the gang) Okay, I\xc2\x92m running\nout of places I can touch him! Look, is there something wrong with me? I mean why am I\nonly attracted to guys where there\xc2\x92s no future? Either they\xc2\x92re too old, or\nthey\xc2\x92re too young, and then there\xc2\x92s Pete who\xc2\x92s-who\xc2\x92s crazy about me,\nand who\xc2\x92s absolutely perfect for me, and there\xc2\x92s like zip going on! I mean,\nseriously, does it sound like something\xc2\x92s wrong with me?!'
Phoebe	 Yeah, kinda.'
Kate	 Happy?! Is that what I\xc2\x92m supposed to be Vic? Happy?'
Joey	 Well, why don\xc2\x92t you tell me what you\xc2\x92re supposed to be! Huh?\nBecause I sure as hell can\xc2\x92t figure it out! I talk to you and nothin\xc2\x92. You look\nat me, and it\xc2\x92s nothin\xc2\x92. (He kisses her) Nothing.'
The Director	 Tasty! I\xc2\x92m really starting to feel like you guys have a\nhistory, it\xc2\x92s-it\xc2\x92s nice.'
Kate	 I have a question about this scene.'
The Director	 Yes?'
Kate	 Well, I don\xc2\x92t understand why Adrienne\xc2\x92s attracted to Victor.'
The Director	 Peel the onion. First of all, he\xc2\x92s good looking.'
Joey	 Yeah.'
Kate	 I think my character\xc2\x92s gonna need a little bit more of reason than\nthat.'
Joey	 Oh, hey, how about this one. Ah, it\xc2\x92s says so in the script! Y'know\nah, I-I don\xc2\x92t know why my character likes you either, I mean it says in the script\nhere that you\xc2\x92re a bitch."
Kate	 It doesn\xc2\x92t say that in the script.'
Joey	 It does in mine!'
Chandler	 I can blow dry it. I can put gel on it. It doesn\xc2\x92t matter, I\nstill wind up with this little (pats the flat spot on the back of his head) cowlicky thing\non the middle part of my head. It\xc2\x92s so annoying. Does it bug you?'
Ross	 You bug me.'
Chandler	 Is there any chance you didn\xc2\x92t see that?'

Chandler	 Ross! You gotta stop! Okay?! You can\xc2\x92t just stare through the\npeep hole for three hours! You\xc2\x92re gonna get peep eye!'
Ross	 I knew it! I knew it! I always knew she liked him! Y'know, she\xc2\x92d say\nno, but here we are! Right? We just broke up, first thing she does!"
Chandler	 You didn\xc2\x92t just break up.'
Ross	 Hey, it\xc2\x92s been like three weeks!'
Chandler	 You slept with somebody three hours after you thought you broke up. I\nmean bullets have left guns slower!'
Ross	 Here they come, here they come. Oh-ho, if she kisses him goodnight,\nI\xc2\x92m gonna kill myself, I swear. I can\xc2\x92t, I can\xc2\x92t watch this. (turns away,\nthen quickly turns to look again) Come on, date over! Date over! Uh-oh, here we go,\nshe\xc2\x92s going in.'
Chandler	 Okay.'
Ross	 She\xc2\x92s going in. Wait! He\xc2\x92s going in! He\xc2\x92s going in!! The\ndoor\xc2\x92s closed! I, I can\xc2\x92t see anything but the door closed!!'
Chandler	 And the inventor of the door rests happily in his grave.'
Ross	 Okay, I have to do something. I mean, I have, I have to stop it!'
Chandler	 Stop what?!'
Ross	 I don\xc2\x92t know, but I ah, I have the feeling that my being there will\ndo it. I\xc2\x92ll go over and I will borrow something. Juice!! I need juice!!'
Chandler	 No!! You can\xc2\x92t!! '
Ross	 Look, they must be stopped!'
Chandler	 I am your friend, and I am not gonna let you do this!!\n(Ross is now dragging Chandler and the foosball table to the door) You are surprisingly\nstrong!'
Ross	 I need juice! People need juice!!'
Chandler	 Look man!'
Ross	 People need juice!'
Chandler	 Listen to me!! (Chandler turns him around and closes and holds the\ndoor shut with his feet.) '
Ross	 Juice, I need...'
Chandler	 She\xc2\x92s moving on! Okay, if it\xc2\x92s not this guy, it\xc2\x92s gonna\nbe somebody else! And unless you\xc2\x92re thinking about subletting my peep hole, you\nare going to have to get used to the fact that the relationship is over! Okay, man?\nIt\xc2\x92s over.'
Ross	 Yeah, okay. '
Chandler	 Okay. '
Ross	 It\xc2\x92s just I miss her so much.'
Chandler	 I know. (He rubs Ross\xc2\x92s head) '
Mark	 Why do all you\xc2\x92re coffee mugs have numbers on the bottom?'
Rachel	 Oh. That\xc2\x92s so Monica can keep track. That way if one on them is\nmissing, she can be like, \xc2\x91Where\xc2\x92s number 27?!\xc2\x92'
Rachel	 Y'know what?"
Mark	 No. And I don\xc2\x92t think I\xc2\x92m gonna want to.'
Rachel	 I can\xc2\x92t do this.'
Mark	 Yep. Yep, that\xc2\x92s what I didn\xc2\x92t want to know.'
Rachel	 Well, oh, Mark, I\xc2\x92m doing this for the wrong reasons, y'know?\nI\xc2\x92m just doing it to get back at Ross. I\xc2\x92m sorry, it\xc2\x92s not very fair to\nyou."
Mark	 Ahh! Fair, schmair! Y'know? Look, if you want to get back at Ross, I am\nhere for you. Really? No-no, I say-I say, I say we get back at him right on this couch.\nRight here!"
Rachel	 Oh God. I\xc2\x92m sorry about this.'
Mark	 That\xc2\x92s okay.'
Rachel	 You sure?'
Mark	 Yeah. I can just go home and get back at him by myself.'
Spokeswoman	 ...has become the penicillin of the twenty-first century. And so\ntoday, this hospital is about to take major steps toward leading that revolution. It is\ntruly ironic, on one hand consider the size...'
Pete	 (to Monica) Hey, can I ask you something?'
Monica	 Sure.'
Pete	 Where are we? '
Monica	 (looks around) Well, with all these doctors and nurses, I\xc2\x92m gonna\nsay, midget rodeo.'
Pete	 Just tell me the truth.'
Monica	 Okay. Umm, y'know, I don\xc2\x92t think, I don\xc2\x92t think I told you\nthis, but umm, I just got out of a really serious relationship."
Pete	 Oh, yeah. Wasn\xc2\x92t that like a year ago?'
Monica	 So I did tell you. Okay, y'know, that really isn\xc2\x92t the thing. Umm,\nthe thing is that, right now I\xc2\x92m just in a place in my life where I need to focus on\nme. Y'know what I mean?"
Pete	 Oh, yeah. I know that.'
Monica	 I so wanna be attracted to you.'
Pete	 But you\xc2\x92re not. Okay, good.'
Monica	 I\xc2\x92m sorry.'
Pete	 Y'know what, don\xc2\x92t be. This is not, don\xc2\x92t be, \xc2\x91cause\nit\xc2\x92s not so bad."
Monica	 It\xc2\x92s not?'
Pete	 I know I\xc2\x92m no John Bon Jovi, (Monica laughs) or someone\nwho find attractive, I\xc2\x92m just, I think, y'know, that you might end up feeling\ndifferently."
Monica	 Well, um, look I-I don\xc2\x92t want this to come our wrong, but ah, you\nseem awfully confident for a guy I just told I wasn\xc2\x92t attracted too.'
Pete	 Yeah, stupidly charming isn\xc2\x92t\xc2\x92 it? Well listen let\xc2\x92s, you\nwanna get something to eat? \xc2\x91Cause this place is kinda depressing. (they start\nto leave)'
Spokeswoman	 And the man who made all this possible... Mr. Peter Becker.'
Pete	 (to Monica) One second.'
Chandler	 I don\xc2\x92t think this town is big enough for both of us to relax in.\n(He blows on his hand) Draw!! (He quickly pulls the lever to raise the foot rest, like a\ngunfighter in a Western.) '
Chandler	 (to Joey) I wasn\xc2\x92t doing anything. (Joey starts angrily throwing\nhis stuff down.) Uh-oh, what did she do now?'
Joey	 Just because she went to Yale drama, she thinks she\xc2\x92s like the\ngreatest actress since, since, sliced bread!'
Chandler	 Ah, Sliced Bread, a wonderful Lady MacBeth.'
Joey	 God, I just, I hate her! I hate her!! With her, \xc2\x91Oh, I\xc2\x92m so\ntalented.\xc2\x92 and \xc2\x91Oh, I\xc2\x92m so pretty,\xc2\x92 and \xc2\x91Ooh, I smell so\ngood.\xc2\x92'
Chandler	 I think somebody has a crush on somebody.'
Joey	 Hey, Chandler, can we please stay focused on my problem here?! Y'know?"
Chandler	 I\xc2\x92m talking about you. You big, big freak.'
Joey	 Oh. (realises) Ohh. Ohh, you\xc2\x92re out of your mind.'
Chandler	 Hey, you have nothing but talk about her for the last 48 hours! If you\nwere in a school yard you\xc2\x92d be pulling her pigtails and pushing her down now!'
Joey	 Oh, yeah?! Then how come I keep thinking about her in all these sexual\nscenarios and stuff huh?!'
Kate	 Happy?! Is that what I\xc2\x92m supposed to be Vic? Happy?'
Joey	 Well, why don\xc2\x92t you tell me what you\xc2\x92re supposed to be! Huh?\nBecause I sure as hell can\xc2\x92t figure it out! I talk to you and it\xc2\x92s nothin\xc2\x92.\nYou look at me, and nothin\xc2\x92. (He kisses her, more passionately this time) Nothing.'
The Director	 You guys make me fly! High! Okay, we\xc2\x92re gonna pick it up\nhere, tomorrow.'
Kate	 Well, that was ah...'
Joey	 Better?'
Kate	 Yeah! Yeah, it was definitely an improvement. G\xc2\x92night.'
Joey	 Ah, Kate? '
Kate	 Yeah?'
Joey	 You ah, you forgot your shoes.'
Kate	 (she giggles) I\xc2\x92m probably gonna need those. Huh? (she giggles some\nmore)'
Joey	 Hey, listen you ah....'
Kate	 Hmm?'
Joey	 ...feel like getting a cup of coffee?'
Kate	 Umm.'
The Director	 (leaning in) Kate?'
Kate	 Yep.'
The Director	 You ready to go?'
Kate	 Yeah.'
The Director	 (to Joey) Very nice. Very nice. (he walks away)'
Kate	 So umm, I\xc2\x92ll see you tomorrow, huh?'
Joey	 Yeah, yeah sure, goodnight.'
Phoebe	 (to Chandler) Hey! (Chandler looks up, startled) Why isn\xc2\x92t it\nSpiderman? Y\xc2\x92know like Goldman, Silverman...'
Chandler	 \xc2\x91Cause it\xc2\x92s-it\xc2\x92s not his last name.'
Phoebe	 It isn\xc2\x92t?'
Chandler	 No, it\xc2\x92s not like, like Phil Spiderman. He\xc2\x92s a spider, man.\nY'know like ah, like Goldman is a last name, but there\xc2\x92s no Gold Man."
Phoebe	 Oh, okay. There should be Gold Man!'
Rachel	 (entering) Hey!'
Monica	 Hey, Rach, how was work?'
Rachel	 Oh, great. Although I did sit down where there wasn\xc2\x92t a chair.'
Monica	 By the way, Ross dropped by a box of your stuff.'
Rachel	 Oh, well, I guess I had that one coming. I\xc2\x92m just gonna throw it\nout, it\xc2\x92s probably just a bunch of shampoo and... (she opens the box and stops)'
Monica	 Something wrong?'
Rachel	 (She takes the T-shirt out of the box and holds it to her chest and take\na deep breath.) No. Nothing. (She smiles and goes into her room.)'

Chandler	 So, ahh, what kind of powers would Gold Man have?'
Phoebe	 Okay well, he would turn things to gold.'
Chandler	 What about things that are already gold?'
Phoebe	 Ahh, his work is done.'
Chandler	 Okay, let\xc2\x92s play my game now.'
Phoebe	 Okay. All right you yellow-bellied-lilly-livered-DRAW!! (they both kick\nup the foot rests like an old fashioned gun fight.)'
