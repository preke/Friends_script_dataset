Joey	 All right! Here we go! 1999! The year of Joey!'
Chandler	 (deadpan, standing next to Monica) We're very happy for you."
Joey	 What's the matter?!"
Chandler	 We wanted to kiss at midnight, but nobody else is going to so\ny'know\xc2\x85"
Joey	 All right, I'll take care of it."
Monica	 Oh no, wait! Joey!'
Ross	 (hopping) 73! 72! 71!'
Joey	 Ross! Ross! Ross, listen! Who are you kissing at midnight, huh? Rachel or\nPhoebe?'
Ross	 What?'
Joey	 Well you gotta kiss someone, you can't kiss your sister."
Ross	 Well, who's gonna kiss my sister."
Joey	 Chandler.'
Ross	 Awww, man! Really?'
Joey	 Dude-dude, who would you rather have kiss your sister, me or Chandler?'
Ross	 That's a good point."
Joey	 Yeah.'
Ross	 Oh well, since I have that whole history with Rachel, I guess Phoebe.'
Joey	 Okay, great!'
Ross	 All right.'
Joey	 Pheebs! Pheebs! Ross wants to kiss you at midnight!'
Phoebe	 It's so obvious, why doesn't he just ask?"
Joey	 Rach! Rach! Listen, I'm gonna kiss you at midnight."
Rachel	 What?!'
Ross	 Well, everyone's gotta kiss someone. You can't kiss Ross you got the\nhistory."
Rachel	 So?'
Joey	 So? Who would you rather have kiss you, me or Chandler?'
Rachel	 Oh, good point.'
Joey	 Yeah!'
All	 (watching the ball drop) 3! 2! 1! HAPPY NEW YEAR!!'
Chandler	 (To Monica) Happy New Year!'
Monica	 Happy New Year.'
Ross	 (To Phoebe) Happy New Year, Pheebs!'
Phoebe	 You too!'
Rachel	 (To Joey) Happy New Year, Joey!'
Joey	 So did that do anything for ya?'

Ross	 Y'know what? I'm gonna go out on a limb and say no divorces in '99!"
Rachel	 But your divorce isn't even final yet."
Ross	 Just the one divorce in '99! Y'know what, I am gonna be happy this year. I\nam gonna make myself happy."
Chandler	 Do you want us to leave the room, or?'
Ross	 Everyday I am gonna do one thing that I haven't done before. That\nmy friends is my New Year's resolution."
Phoebe	 Ooh! That's a good one! Mine is to pilot a commercial jet."
Chandler	 That's good one too, Pheebs. Now all you have to do is find a\nplaneload of people who's resolution is to plummet to their deaths."
Phoebe	 Maybe your resolution is to not make fun of your friends, especially the\nones who may soon be flying you to Europe for free on their own plane.'
Monica	 She has a better chance of sprouting wings and flying up your nose than\nyou do of not making fun of us.'
Ross	 In fact, I'll bet you 50 bucks that you can't go the whole year without\nmaking fun of us. Eh, y'know what, better yet? A week."
Chandler	 I\'ll take that bet my friend. And you know what, paying me the 50\nbucks could be the "new thing you do that day!" (Ross looks at him.) And it\nstarts right now!'
Joey	 All right, my New Year's resolution is to learn how to play the guitar."
Ross	 Ohh.'
Phoebe	 Really?! How come?'
Joey	 Well, y'know those special skills I have listed on my resume? I would love\nit would be great if one of those was true."
Phoebe	 Do you want me to teach you? I'm a great teacher."
Joey	 Really? Who-who have you taught?'
Phoebe	 Well, I taught me and I love me.'
Joey	 Yeah that'd be great! Thanks Pheebs!"
Rachel	 Op, look! Claire forgot her glasses! And she's gonna be really needing\nthese to keep an eye on that boyfriend, who, I hear, needs to keep his stapler in his desk\ndrawer, if you know what I'm talking about."
Monica	 Hey Rach, maybe your resolution should be to umm, gossip less.'
Rachel	 I don't gossip!"
Rachel	 Well, maybe sometimes I find out things or I hear something and I pass\nthat information on y'know kinda like a public service, it doesn't mean I'm a gossip. I\nmean, would you call Ted Kopel a gossip?"
Monica	 Well if Ted Kopel talked about his coworkers botched boob jobs, I would.'
Rachel	 What? They were like this! '
Ross	 Okay! (She leaves.) (To Chandler and Joey.) Hey!'
Chandler and Joey	 Hey!'
Ross	 I just asked that girl out.'
Chandler	 Nice!'
Joey	 Nice!! Yeah! Is that part of your resolution, your new thing for today?'
Ross	 Yes it is. See. (Shows them the piece of paper she gave him with her name\nand phone number on it.)'
Chandler	 (reading it) Elizabeth Hornswoggle?'
Ross	 That's right, uh, Elizabeth Hornswoggle."
Chandler	 Horn-swoggle.'
Joey	 You all right Chandler? Is there something funny about that name?'
Chandler	 No. No, I just think that maybe I-I'd heard it somewhere before. (Sits\ndown rubbing his temple.)"
Joey	 Oh really! Where? Somewhere funny I'd bet! (Chandler is straining to keep\nquiet as Phoebe enters.)"
Ross	 Hi, Pheebs!'
Phoebe	 Hey! '
Ross	 Oh-oh, guess what? I-I have a date with Elizabeth (Talking into Chandler's\near.) Hornswoggle."
Phoebe	 Hornswoggle? (To Chandler) Ooh, this must be killing you.'
Ross	 All right, see you later.'
Joey	 See ya! All right Pheebs, I am ready for my first lesson. '
Phoebe	 Okay. (Joey tries to take the guitar.) Oh no-no-no, you don't touch the\nguitar! First you learn here, (Points to her head.) then you learn here. (Points to the\nguitar.)"
Joey	 Umm, okay.'
Phoebe	 Okay, lesson one
Chandler	 What an interesting approach to guitar instruction. Y'know some might\nfind it amusing, I myself find it regular."
Phoebe	 Hey everybody, Rachel was so good today. She didn't gossip at all."
Rachel	 I didn\xc2\x92t! Even when I found out\xc2\x85umm, all right, well let's\njust say I found something out something about someone and let's just say she's gonna keep\nit. (Goes into her room.)"
Joey	 Hey, Pheebs! Check-check this out. (Holds up his hand in one of Phoebe's\nchords.)"
Phoebe	 Ooh, you nailed the Old Lady! (They both laugh at what she said.)'
Joey	 Yeah listen so, I thought I was getting better, so on my way home today I\nstopped by this guitar store and\xc2\x85'
Phoebe	 Did you, did you touch any of the guitars while you were there?\nDid you?!'
Joey	 No.'
Phoebe	 Give me your hands. (He does and she smells his left hand.) Strings.\nGimme it! (He gives her his right hand and she smells it as well.) Pick. Do you want to\nlearn to play guitar?'
Joey	 Yes!'
Phoebe	 Then don't touch one!!"
Ross	 (entering, with Ben) Hi!'
Ben	 Hi! '
Monica	 Hi Ben!'
Ben	 Auntie Monica!! (He runs to hug her.)'
Chandler	 (notices something) Ross is wearing leather pants! Does nobody else\nsee that Ross is wearing leather pants? (Pause, no one speaks.) Someone comment on the\npants!'
Rachel	 I think they're very nice."
Monica	 I like 'em."
Joey	 Yeah! (Chandler bangs the table in frustration.)'
Monica	 I like them a lot.'
Chandler	 That's not what I had in mind! See, people like Ross don't generally\nwear these types of pants. You see, they're very tight. (Motions to Ross's buttock.) Maybe\nthere's something in that area."
Ross	 Oh see, I-I needed a new thing for today and there\'s this leather store\nthat always smells so good and I thought to myself, "Wow, (To Chandler) I never\nreally owned a good smelling pair of pants before."'
Chandler	 Oh come on!! (Storms out.)'
Ross	 (after he's left) Okay, seriously, what do you think?"
Joey	 You look like a freak.'
Rachel	 Awful, absolutely awful. (Plus other negative comments from Phoebe and\nMonica.)'
Ross	 What are you, what are you doing?'
Monica	 It's my New Year's resolution!"
Ross	 What, to blind my child?'
Monica	 No! To take more pictures of all of us together. I mean I really think\nit's the best resolution because everyone will enjoy the pictures."
Joey	 Well, everyone will enjoy my music as well. (Does a chord and Monica\nstarts taking pictures of him and Phoebe. They both start to strike a pose with the\nexcessive amount of pictures that Monica takes.)'
Ross	 (talking to himself) My God! These pants are burning up! (He's still\nwearing the leather pants.) (She snuggles closer.) Oh come on, she wants to snuggle now!\nWhat is she trying to kill me? It's like a volcano in here! (Out loud.) Are you hot? "
Elizabeth Hornswoggle	 No.'
Ross	 Okay, it must just be me then.'
Ross	 That was just the pants on the couch. Umm, hey, do you, do you mind if I\nuse your bathroom?'
Elizabeth	 No, go ahead.'
Ross	 Thanks. (Gets up and as he does so, the sound returns. Without another\nword he heads into her bathroom.)'
Ross	 (in ecstasy) Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh\xc2\x85\xc2\x85\xc2\x85.'
Elizabeth	 (yelling from outside) Hey, my favorite part is coming up!'
Ross	 'Kay!"
Ross	 Oh my God!'
Phoebe	 Tiger! (Joey moves his hand in an attempt to do the chord, in fact he\ndoes it with each name.) Dragon! Iceberg!! (He fails.) Joseph, did you even study at all\nlast night?'
Joey	 Yes! Yes, I did.'
Phoebe	 Then do Iceberg!'
Joey	 (thinks) (quietly) G-sharp.'
Phoebe	 G-sharp? Have you been studying the real names of the chords?\n(Joey doesn't answer.) Have you? (He looks away in shame.) Oh my God! "
Joey	 What?! I didn't touch a guitar!"
Phoebe	 No, but you're questioning my method!"
Joey	 No, I'm not questioning it, I'm saying it's stupid! (Notices Monica\nstanding between them and smiling.) What?! (The camera clicks, taking another picture.)"
Monica	 Thank you. (Leaves.)'
Phoebe	 Y'know none of my other student thought I was stupid."
Joey	 Your other student, was you!'
Phoebe	 Yeah, well, y'know maybe you just need to try a little harder!"
Joey	 (looking in the Yellow Pages) Look, maybe I need to try a real teacher!\nRight here! Here! Andy Cooper, he teaches guitar and look ooh, there's a nice picture of\nhim with a little kid and THE KID'S GOT A GUITAR!!!!!! (Storms out.)"
Phoebe	 Fine! You go learn from your qualified instructor! But don't come crying\nto me when everyone's sick and tired of hearing you play Bad, Bad Leroy Brown!!"
Rachel	 (entering, singing) "Baddest man in the whole damn town."'
Phoebe	 Oh, fine! Take his side! (Storms out.)'
Monica	 (on phone) I can't wait to be with you! I'll sneak over as soon as Ross\npicks up Ben. I'll just tell Rachel I'm gonna be doing laundry for a couple of hours."
Chandler	 (on phone) Laundry. Huh. Is that my new nickname? (Rachel is\nabsolutely stunned, she opens her mouth in absolute amazement.)'
Monica	 (on phone) Awww, y'know what your nickname is, Mr. Big\xc2\x85"
Rachel	 Arghh!! (She quickly hangs up the phone and starts to pace around\nwondering what to do.)'

Joey	 (answering phone) Hello?'
Ross	 (calling from Elizabeth's bathroom) Joey, it's Ross! I need some help!"
Joey	 Uhh, Chandler's not here."
Ross	 Well, you can help me!'
Joey	 Okay.'
Ross	 Listen, I'm in Elizabeth's bathroom\xc2\x85"
Joey	 Nice!'
Ross	 No, I-I got really hot in my leather pants so I took them off but they\nmust have shrunk from the-the sweat or-or-or my legs expanded from the heat. Look, I-I\ncan't put them back on. I can't!"
Joey	 Oh. That is quite a situation. Uh, do you see any like, powder?'
Ross	 Powder! Yeah! Yeah, I have powder! (Grabs some of her shelf.) '
Joey	 Good-good, okay, sprinkle some of that on your legs, it'll absorb some of\nthe moisture and then you can get your pants back up."
Ross	 Yeah, okay, hold on! (He puts the phone down and proceeds to spread a\nlarge amount of powder on his legs and makes another attempt at pulling up his pants. It\ndoesn't work, and without picking up the phone leans down to it.) (Almost in tears.)\nThey're not coming on man."
Joey	 Umm, do you see any\xc2\x97oh, Vaseline? '
Ross	 Ohh, I-I see lotion, I have lotion! Will that work?'
Joey	 Yeah, sure, spread some of that on there.'
Ross	 Hold on.'
Joey	 Ross? You okay?'
Ross	 They're still, they're still not coming on man and the lotion and the\npowder have made a paste!"
Joey	 Really?! Uhh, what color is it?'
Ross	 What difference does that make?!'
Joey	 Well, I'm just\xc2\x97if the paste matches the pants, you can make yourself\na pair of paste pants and she won't know the difference!"
Rachel	 (entering) Joey, do you have a minute?'
Ross	 Dude, what am I gonna\xc2\x85'
Joey	 (To Ross) Uh, Rachel's here, so good luck man, let me know how it works\nout. (He hangs up the phone and strands Ross in the bathroom.)"
Rachel	 Oh, Joey, I have such a problem!'
Joey	 Oh well, you're timing couldn't be better. I am putting out fires all over\nthe place."
Rachel	 Okay. Okay. Okay. Joey, I have got to tell you something!'
Joey	 What-what is it, what is it?'
Rachel	 Oh my God, it's so huge, but you just have to promise me that you cannot\ntell anyone."
Joey	 Oh no, no-no-no-no! I don't want to know!"
Rachel	 Yes! Yes! Yes, you do want to know! This is unbelievable!'
Joey	 I don't care, Rach! Look, I am tired of being the guy who knows all the\nsecrets but can't tell anyone!"
Rachel	 What? What secrets? You know secrets? What are they?'
Joey	 And you're not supposed to be gossiping!! "
Rachel	 I know, I know! I just can't keep this one in, so I pick up the\nphone\xc2\x85 (Joey in a childish attempt to not hear what Rachel is about to say, puts his\nfingers in his ears and starts to scream loudly. Rachel turns and walks out upon seeing\nthat Joey's not gonna listen, and as she exits Chandler walks in and sees Joey in his\ncurrent state.)"
Joey	 I'm not listening to you!"
Elizabeth	 Ross, umm, you've been in there for a long time. I'm starting to get\nkinda freaked out."
Ross	 All right, I'm coming out. Hey, can you turn the lights off."
Elizabeth	 No, let's just leave the lights on."
Elizabeth	 Oh my God!'
Ross	 I had a problem.'
Joey	 Hey, Pheebs?'
Phoebe	 No, I can't talk to you! I don't have a fancy ad in the Yellow Pages!"
Joey	 Look, Pheebs, I just, I wanna apologize for, for saying that your method\nwas stupid and-and maybe ask you to be my teacher again. And-and I promise, I won't touch\na guitar until you say I'm ready. (After a short pause she hands him her guitar.) You\nreally think I'm ready?"
Phoebe	 Uh-huh!'
Joey	 Wow! Cool! (He takes the guitar, stands up, and goes to play a note.\nHowever, while strumming it, he knocks it out of his hands and it bounces off the table\nand lands on the floor. Phoebe just stares at the guitar.)'
Joey	 (sitting back down) Was the chord at least right\xc2\x85'
Phoebe	 No!'
Chandler	 Oh my God!'
Monica	 We heard about your pants, I'm so sorry."
Ross	 This year was supposed to be great! But, it's only the second day and I'm\na loser with stupid leather pants that don't even fit!"
All	 No. No, you're not a loser."
Ross	 Look at me! (Chandler squeaks in an attempt not to make fun of him.)'
Monica	 Hey, hey, look. Look Ross, Ben drew a picture of you! (Shows him Ben's\npicture.) Huh? You're-you're a cowboy!"
Ross	 Oh, be-because of the leather pants.'
Monica	 See? Ben doesn't think you're a loser, he thinks you're a cowboy! Now\nthat's something."
Phoebe	 Yeah!'
Rachel	 That really is something; that's really cool."
Joey	 Howdy partner!'
Ross	 Maybe I should get another pair! Ooh, y'know, they-they had some with\nfringe all down the sides. (Chandler starts rubbing his temple again.) I'm gonna go kiss\nBen goodnight. (He starts to head for Monica's bedroom.) I can't believe he thinks I'm a\ncowboy. (Pause.) I would make a good cowboy. (He struts into Monica's room.)"
Monica	 Okay, now that everything's wrapped up here, I think I'm, I'm gonna go\ndo my laundry."
Chandler	 Oh yeah, me too. Y'know if this shirt is dirty. (Smells it.) Yep."
Phoebe	 Okay, I'm gonna go too. I'm gonna go to the airport. I figure if I hang\naround there long enough, someone's bound to leave one of those planes unattended."
Rachel	 Good luck, honey!'
Phoebe	 Bye! (She exits, leaving Rachel and Joey alone.)'
Rachel	 Hey, uh, Joey?'
Joey	 Umm?'
Rachel	 Remember that big thing I was gonna tell you about?'
Joey	 Oh, no! (Starts that screaming thing again. Rachel stops him by pulling\nhis fingers out of his ears.)'
Rachel	 I'm not gonna tell you, but if you found out on your own, that would be\nokay and then we could talk about it. Right?"
Joey	 Well, then it wouldn't be a secret. So yeah, that would be okay. Yeah.\nYeah!"
Rachel	 (quietly) Yeah. Well. (Pause.) Hey uh Joe, would mind going over to\nChandler's bedroom and get that book back that he borrowed from me?"
Joey	 Now? You want me to go over there now?'
Rachel	 Yeah!'
Joey	 Do you know something?'
Rachel	 Do you know something?'
Joey	 I might know something.'
Rachel	 I might know something too.'
Joey	 What's the thing you know?"
Rachel	 Oh no, I can't tell you until you tell me what you know."
Joey	 I can't tell you what I know."
Rachel	 Well then I can't tell you what I know."
Joey	 Okay, fine.'
Joey	 You don't know!"
Rachel	 All right, how about I go over there and I will walk into\nChandler's bedroom and I will see that thing that I think that I know is actually\nthe thing that I think that I know! (Note
Joey	 (gasps) YOU KNOW!!!!'
Rachel	 AND YOU KNOW!!!'
Joey	 Yeah, I know!!!!'
Rachel	 Chandler and Monica?!! Oh, this is unbelievable!! How long have you\nknown?'
Joey	 Too long! Oh my God, Rach, I've been dying to talk to someone about this\nfor so long! Listen, listen, we can't say anything about this to anybody, they're so weird\nabout that! Listen\xc2\x85 (Phoebe returns and interrupts them.)"
Joey and Rachel	 Hey!'
Phoebe	 Hey! It's raining. I don't want to fly in the rain. So\xc2\x85"
Joey	 Oh, I am going to go for a walk in the rain.'
Rachel	 Ohhh, yeah, me too.'
Phoebe	 That's weird. (Pause.) I bet they're doing it."

Chandler	 (entering) Oh good, okay, I can't take it anymore. I can't take it\nanymore. So you win, okay? Here! (Hands him the 50 bucks he's about to owe him.) Pheebs?\nFlying a jet? Better make it a spaceship so that you can get back to your home\nplanet! And Ross, phone call for you today, Tom Jones, he wants his pants back! And\nHornswoggle? What are you dating a character from Fraggile Rock?! (He sits down and\nsighs in relief.)"
