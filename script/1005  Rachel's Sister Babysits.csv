Rachel	 You know, I'm thinking about letting Emma have her \n  first cookie."
Joey	 Her first cookie? She has cookies all the time!'
Rachel	 I've never given her a cookie. Have you?"
Joey	 No! No... and, for the record, I've also never given her a frosting from \n  a can!"
Monica	 Hey Rach, the adoption agency needs letters of recommendation and we \n  were wondering if you would write one for us.'
Rachel	 Of course, I'd be honored!"
Chandler	 Thanks!'
Monica	 Thank you!'
Joey	 U-U-Um, I think there's been an oversight."
Chandler	 Joey, we would've asked you, we just thought you wouldn't be interested."
Monica	 Yeah, it\'s just we don\'t think of you as really being so much "with \n  the words".'
Joey	 Whoo-weh hey weh-hey whoo hey!!'
Monica	 Clearly we were wrong.'
Joey	 I gotta a lot of nice stuff to say about you guys, ok? And I know how \n  much you wanna have a baby, you know, and I would love to help you get one.'
Monica	 You know what? Then, Joey, we want you to do it.'
Joey	 Thank you! Alright, let me see how I\'m gonna start... "Dear baby \n  adoption decider people..."'
Chandler	 So excited about your letter!'
Phoebe	 Hey!'
All	 Hey Phoebe!'
Joey	 Hey!'
Monica	 Wow! Don't you look nice?!"
Phoebe	 Yes, I do! Today is Mike and my one-year anniversary.'
Rachel	 OH! What's it the anniversary of? Your first date, your first kiss, \n  first time you had sex..."
Phoebe	 YEAH!'
Chandler	 So you must be going to somewhere fancy to celebrate?'
Phoebe	 Uh-uh. Ehm, a Knicks game.'
Joey	 Uhm... Aren't you a little overdressed?"
Phoebe	 Hey, you know what, I've never had a one-year anniversary before, so \n  no matter where we go, I'm wearing something fancy pants, and... I'm gonna put \n  on my finest jewelry and we're gonna have sex in a public rest room."
Monica	 You guys do that? Chandler won't even have sex in\nour bathroom!"
Chandler	 That's where people make number two!!"

Charlie	 Hey! (They kiss and cuddle a little)'
Ross	 Hey...'
Charlie	 So, you know... I have a little time. If you... if you want to...'
Ross	 (surprised) Oh... (he pauses) (sounds disappointed) Ohh... I'd love to \n  but I really have to grade these papers."
Charlie	 Fine, it's fine... (she whispers) I'll just shower by myself..."
Ross	 (Writing on the papers) B, B, B, B, B!'
Charlie	 Oh, Ross, you gave a B to a Pottery Barn catalogue.'
Ross	 Well, it had some good ideas, take off your shirt.'
Ross	 Damnit!'
Amy	 (yelling from outside) Rachel!! Open up!! It's your sister!! (she knocks \n  on the door again) I have to talk to you!!"
Ross	 (he opens the door) Hi Amy!'
Amy	 You're not Rachel."
Ross	 Still sharp as a tack!'
Amy	 Um... Charlie, this is Rachel's sister Amy. Amy, this is Charlie."
Charlie	 Hi!'
Amy	 Hi!'
Charlie	 Nice to meet you.'
Amy	 H-Hi!!(to Ross) And you are...?'
Ross	 (pause) Ross? I... I grew up on your block! We had Thanksgiving together \n  last year... I had a baby with your sister!'
Amy	 (looks confused) N-no... uhm... did I buy a falafel from you yesterday?'
Ross	 (gives up) Yes, yes, you did.'
Ross	 Hi Rachel! Here's your sister Amy! She thinks I need\n  pec implants! \n"
Rachel	 Amy! Hi! Oh-oh-hoh! (they hug) Wow! You remember Joey?'
Amy	 Yeah! Hey, sure! The "Days of Our Lives" guy!'
Joey	 That's right, yeah."
Amy	 You're not good!"
Joey	 Always nice to meet a fan!'
Rachel	 So now, what are you doing here?'
Amy	 Well, I have huge news.'
Rachel	 (Emma starts crying in the other room) Oh sorry, hold on. Let me just \n  check on the baby!'
Amy	 Wait, this is important! Can Ella wait? (Rachel goes to Emma)'
Ross	 Ehm... Her name is Emma.'
Amy	 Why did you change it, Ella was so much prettier!'
Ross	 What do I know? I just sell Middle Eastern food from a cart!'
Amy	 Hey, your English is getting better!!'
Ross	 (to Joey) Oh my God!'
Joey	 I know, she may be the hottest girl I've ever hated."
Ross	 What... what you working on?'
Joey	 (using a laptop) Oh, Monica and Chandler's recommendation. I want it \n  to sound smart but.. I don't know any big words or anything, so..."
Ross	 Why don't you use your Thesaurus?"
Joey	 What did I just say?'
Ross	 Watch. (he takes the laptop) Here, you ehm... You highlight the word \n  you want to change.\n  Go under Tools and the Thesaurus generates... 'gives'... 'gives' a whole list \n  of choices. You can pick the word that sounds smartest."
Joey	 Oh my God, that\'s great! I\'m smart!! No, no, I\'m... (he uses the Thesaurus) \n  "brainy, bright, clever", I love this thing! Look out ladies, Joey \n  Tribbiani\'s got the whole package!!'
 Rachel	 God!\n'
Amy	 So beautiful.'
Rachel	 Oh, I know, isn't she?"
Amy	 No, I was talking about your bedding.'
Rachel	 All right. What's your news, Amy?"
Amy	 Oh! Um... Well... I'm getting married."
Rachel	 What? Oh my God! To who?'
Amy	 This guy! He has a killer apartment.'
Rachel	 A-And??'
Amy	 A-And it's on Fifth. And the elevator opens up right into the living room."
Rachel	 No, what's he like?"
Amy	 Oh! He's ok. Do you remember my old boyfriend Mark?"
Rachel	 Yeah.'
Amy	 It's his dad."
Rachel	 Huh... wow, so he's gotta be..."
Amy	 Old? Yeah! But he travels a lot, so he's hardly ever there."
Rachel	 Sweety, I gotta tell ya... it sounds a little bit like you like the \n  apartment more than you like...'
Amy	 Myron. Hmm... I told you he was old!'
Rachel	 Oh... sit down, sit down. Oh, honey, you know, I once also almost married \n  somebody that I didn\xe2\x80\x99t love. Do you remember Barry?'
Amy	 Humpf, remember him? How we used to make out all the time after you went \n  to sleep.'
Rachel	 Sometimes just nodding is ok. (pause) Uhm, so but\n  anyway, listen, not marrying Barry was the best decision that I ever, ever\n  made. Honey, you deserve\n  true love. Your soulmate is out there, somewhere. Someone that is your age,\n  that is smart, that is fun and that you care about!'
Amy	 (thinks about it) You\xe2\x80\x99re right, you\xe2\x80\x99re right! I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna \n  do it!'
Rachel	 Ok.'
Amy	 I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna marry Myron and keep looking\n  for Mr\nRight.'
Rachel	 Ok, let\xe2\x80\x99s keep talking.'
Phoebe	 Excuse me, anniversary. Excuse me, anniversary. (looking \n  at her ticket). Uhm, sir, could you move your nachos... they\xe2\x80\x99re in my \n  seat. It's my anniversary. (to Mike) Here we are! (Mike nods). Can\xe2\x80\x99t believe \n  it's been a whole year! \n"
Mike	 I know. This has been the best year... (the crowd starts cheering so \n  he starts yelling) THIS HAS BEEN THE BEST YEAR OF MY LIFE!'
Phoebe	 ME TOO! I NEVER THOUGHT I COULD LOVE SOMEONE THIS MUCH!'
Mike	 I FEEL THE SAME WAY!'
Phoebe	 YOU\xe2\x80\x99RE SO GENEROUS AND KIND AND (crowd stops cheering) YOU'RE \n  AMAZING IN BED (everyone hears it and stare at them.) (to everybody) IT\xe2\x80\x99S \n  OUR ANNIVERSARY!"
Announcer	 Knicks fans, please turn your attention to the \n  big screen on the score board. Someone has a special question to ask. (on the \n  screen there\xe2\x80\x99s written \xe2\x80\x98Julie, will you marry me?\xe2\x80\x99 and goes \n  on to show a guy kneeling down in front of a girl holding out a ring to her)'
Phoebe	 Oh how lame... oh, it\xe2\x80\x99s so tacky, and impersonal.'
Mike	 Really?'
Phoebe	 Oh, it\xe2\x80\x99s the worst way to propose!'
Mike	 (looks strangely shocked) Excuse me... (he leaves, then Phoebe realizes \nwhat she did).'
Joey	 Hey, finished my recommendation. (he hands it over to \n  Chandler) Here. And I think you\xe2\x80\x99ll be very, very happy. It\xe2\x80\x99s the \n  longest I ever spent on a computer without looking at porn.'
Chandler	 (reading) I don\xe2\x80\x99t... uh... understand.'
Joey	 (sounding very proud of himself) Some of the words are a little too sophisticated \n  for ya?'
Monica	 (also reading it) It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make any sense.'
Joey	 Of course it does! It\xe2\x80\x99s smart! I used the the-saurus!'
Chandler	 On every word?'
Joey	 Yep!'
Monica	 Alright, what was this sentence originally? (shows the sentence to \n  Joey)'
Joey	 Oh, \xe2\x80\x98They are warm, nice, people with big hearts\xe2\x80\x99.'
Chandler	 And that became \xe2\x80\x98they are humid prepossessing Homo Sapiens \n  with full sized aortic pumps...?'
Joey	 Yeah, yeah and hey, I really mean it, dude.'
Monica	 Hey Joey, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think we can use this.'
Joey	 Why not?'
Monica	 Well, because you signed it baby kangaroo Tribbiani (Joey makes a 'and-what\xe2\x80\x99s-wrong-with-that' \n  look). Hey, why don\xe2\x80\x99t you stop worrying about sounding smart and just \n  be yourself!"
Chandler	 You know what? You don\xe2\x80\x99t need a thesaurus, just write from \nhere, (points at his own heart) your full sized aortic pump.'
Rachel	 Amy, hi!'
Amy	 I took your advice, I left Myron.'
Rachel	 Oh, good for you! '
Amy	 I know! I'm Erin Brockovich!"
Rachel	 Yes you are! Oh, I am so proud of you!'
Amy	 Thank you! So, can I stay with you?'
Rachel	 But Erin Brockovich had her own house.'
Joey	 Ah, look who\xe2\x80\x99s back! (he sees the bags) Why do you have bags? RACH, \n  WHY DOES SHE HAVE BAGS?'
Amy	 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m staying with you guys!'
Joey	 What?'
Amy	 We\xe2\x80\x99re gonna be roomies! (she snaps her finger and points at Joey, \nsnaps her fingers again and points to the bags) Come on!'
Joey	 You slept out here?'
Rachel	 Yeah... Amy kept kicking me in her sleep yelling \xe2\x80\x98Myron, get \n  off!\xe2\x80\x99'
Joey	 But uhm, we're getting rid of her, right? Rach, please tell me we\xe2\x80\x99re \n  getting rid of her."
Rachel	 Joey, I can\xe2\x80\x99t do that!'
Joey	 Oh, come on! Last night I was finishing off a pizza and she said (aping \n  Amy badly) "Uoh oh oh, a moment on the lips, forever on the hips!" \n  I don\xe2\x80\x99t need that kind of talk in my house!'
Rachel	 Well Joey, uhm look, I know that she\xe2\x80\x99s difficult, but I think \n  it\xe2\x80\x99s really good that she\xe2\x80\x99s here.'
Joey	 'Cause we will appreciate it more when she\xe2\x80\x99s gone?"
Rachel	 No, it's just... look, you know, when I first moved to the city I was \n  a lot like her! I was spoiled, self-centered and you guys really took care of \n  me."
Joey	 Yeah, Monica made us!'
Rachel	 Well, uhm... whatever, I have really appreciated it, 'cause I don\xe2\x80\x99t \n  think I would be the person that I am today if it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t for you guys. \n  See, I wanna help Amy the way you guys helped me. And I know it\xe2\x80\x99s gonna \n  take patience, but that\xe2\x80\x99s ok."
Amy	 Good morning.'
Joey	 Yeaah.'
Rachel	 Amy, that\xe2\x80\x99s what I was supposed to wear today, that\xe2\x80\x99s why \n  I hung it on the door.'
Amy	 Oh, sweety, you can\xe2\x80\x99t pull this off.'
Rachel	 Amy, you know what? I was thinking that maybe now it'd be a good time \n  for us to sit down and, you know, talk about your future."
Amy	 Oh, I can\xe2\x80\x99t, honey. I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna go get my eyebrows shaped. (points \n  at her eyebrows) I am not happy. (to Joey who has a pizza box in his hands) \n  Oh... sure you wanna eat that?'
Joey	 (yelling at her) I\xe2\x80\x99M CURVY, AND I LIKE IT!'
Phoebe	 Hi. I just had the worst anniversary ever.'
Chandler	 I doubt that! Tell her about us last\nyear.'
Monica	 Oh, well, I bought Chandler a five hundred dollar watch and he wrote \n  me a rap song.'
Ross	 Seriously?'
Chandler	 Word!'
Phoebe	 Well, mine was worse than that.'
Rachel	 Well, what happened?'
Phoebe	 We were at the game, and this guy proposed to his girlfriend on the \n  big screen thing...'
Rachel	 Oh, that is so tacky.'
Phoebe	 Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s what I said, but it turns out, Mike was planning \n  on proposing to me that same way last night!'
Monica	 Oh my God, Mike was gonna propose?'
Rachel	 Phoebe, that\xe2\x80\x99s huge!'
Ross	 Well, do you wanna marry him?'
Phoebe	 Yeah, I really do! Yes, but, after I dumped on the way he was gonna \n  propose to me, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think he\xe2\x80\x99s ever gonna ask again! I mean, \n  I said no in Barbados and now this!'
Chandler	 She's right! If I were a guy and... (stops himself\n  mid-sentence...everyone stares at him) Did I just say if I were a\n  guy..?"
Monica	 Maybe you don't need him to propose to you, maybe you can propose to \n  him!"
Phoebe	 Oh, I don't know, I don't know, isn't that a little desperate?"
Monica	 I proposed to Chandler! (Phoebe stops herself from laughing) Alright, \n  moving on...'
Chandler	 Oh, I don't think it was desperate, I think it was amazing!"
Monica	 Thank you.'
Phoebe	 (To Rachel and Ross) Well, do you think\n  I should propose?'
Rachel	 I think it could be kind of great!'
Ross	 Absolutely! You'll love the feeling! There's nothing like it!"
Phoebe	 Ok, ok, so how should I do it?'
Monica	 How about at a game, on the big screen?'
Rachel	 (Sarcastically) Uuuh!! How about at a Footlocker? (claps her hands \n  together, faking excitement)'
Monica	 What? what? He obviously thinks that's a nice way to be proposed to, \n  plus he'd never suspect it!"
Phoebe	 Yeah, that does make sense. Ok, now, would... would you two (points \n  to Ross and Chandler) like that?'
Chandler	 Sounds good to me... but what would a guy think? '
Amy	 (To Rachel) Nana is on the phone (Hands the phone over to Rachel)'
Rachel	 (Takes the phone) Oh! That's interesting, since she died seven years \n  ago!!"
Amy	 She did? Who got her condo in Boca?'
Rachel	 (Into the phone) Hello? (announces to Amy) Oh, it's our nanny! (goes \n  back to the phone conversation) Hi! Oh... God! I hope you feel better! Ok, bye! \n  (Hangs up) (To Ross) That's Molly, she's sick. Can you watch Emma today?"
Ross	 No, I can't. I have back-to-back classes. Did Molly say what she had? \n  Because my throat's been hurting?"
Rachel	 Menstrual cramps.'
Ross	 I don't think that's what this is."
Rachel	 (To Monica, Chandler and Phoebe) Can any of you watch Emma?'
Monica	 No, sorry sweety..'
Phoebe	 No, I've got work and then I'm proposing.."
Rachel	 (To Ross) Great, shoot, what are we gonna do?'
Amy	 Well, I can do it.'
Rachel	 (Thinks for a moment) Well, actually... '
Ross	 (He interrupts her immediately, and drags her by her arm to the other \n  side of the room) Well, can I talk to you for a sec.?'
Rachel	 Yeah.'
Ross	 Um, I do not want her baby-sitting our child.'
Rachel	 Why not?'
Ross	 Well, for one thing, she keeps calling her Ella!\n\nRachel
Ross	 Fine, we'll call the next one Ella."
Rachel	 (Shocked) Wha... the next one?'
Ross	 (a little confused) Okay, um... I don't want her watching our baby."
Rachel	 Ross, I am trying to help her become a better person. This is a huge \n  breakthrough for her! She just offered to do something for another human being!!'
Ross	 I... I don't know.."
Rachel	 Ross, I'm telling you, she's giving up getting her eyebrows (points \n  at her own to emphasize the word) shaped to do this alright? Do you understand \n  how important that is in our world?"
Amy	 um... listen, I couldn't help but overhear... 'cause I was trying to... \n  Listen, let me do this alright? I really wanna help you guys out, and plus Rachel's \n  been so wonderful to me... (looks at hem pleadingly)"
Rachel	 Absolutely.'
Amy	 (very excited) Oh! Great! So how much does it pay? (Ross just gives up \nand leaves)'
Chandler	 Hey Joe! How's the second draft of the letter coming?"
Joey	 Great, I'm finished! In fact, I just dropped it off at the agency."
Monica	 You dropped it off?'
Joey	 Yeah.'
Chandler	 Can we read it? Can you print out another copy?'
Joey	 No can do amigo. No, I didn't use the computer. Felt more personal to \n  hand-write it. (Chandler and Monica look even more shocked)"
Monica	 You hand-wrote it?'
Joey	 Yeah, and don't worry. I didn't try to sound smart at\n  all! See ya later! (Leaves)"
Monica	 Oh my God, oh my God, that letter is gonna go in our \n  file! We're never gonna get a kid. No, we're gonna be one of those old couples \n  that collects orchids or has a lot of birds!"
Chandler	 It's ok, it's ok. You know what? (Takes out his mobile) I'll just \n  call the agency and tell them to throw out the letter. (starts dialing)"
Monica	 Okay good.'
Chandler	 (on the phone) Hello, this is Chandler Bing. Somebody just dropped \n  off a handwritten recommendation letter, and.. (listens) Uh-huh... Uh-huh... \n  okay... thank you. Good-bye. (hangs up looking very confused).'
Monica	 Ugh, we're screwed, aren't we? You know what? Just tell me on the way \n  to the bird store."
Chandler	 (Still looks confused) They loved it.'
Monica	 What?'
Chandler	 They thought it was very smart of us to have a\n  child write the recommendation letter.'
Monica	 (surprised) They thought Joey was a child?'
Chandler	 She guessed 8, 9, based on his drawings.'
Amy	 Hi!'
Monica	 Hey, what did you guys do today?'
Amy	 Ella wanted to go out, so we went shopping and got some sushi.'
Chandler	 That sounds like fun.'
Amy	 Yeah, not really. Babies are dull.'
Rachel	 (To Emma) Hey! Hi, how's my girl?"
Amy	 I'm fine! And, I got you a present for letting me stay with you. Ready?"
Rachel	 (sounds excited) Yeah!'
Amy	 Ta-daaa!'
Rachel	 (not excited anymore) You pierced her ears!?'
Amy	 (Very excited about it) Doesn't it make her nose look smaller?"

\nRachel	 You pierced her ears? How could you do this without telling me? '
Amy	 Well, if I had told you, then it wouldn't have been surprise, now would \n  it?"
Chandler	 I think she looks cute. (Rachel turns around and stares at him angrily) \n  ... but I am wrong!'
Rachel	 Oh my God, Oh my God, here comes Ross. He's gonna flip out."
Amy	 Why, did something happen to his falafel cart?'
Rachel	 Ugh. (takes the hat and covers Emma's head and half her face with it)"
Ross	 Hey guys. \n\nMonica and Chandler
Ross	 Hey Emma. Oh, why is she wearing her hat so low? She can barely see. \n  (Wants to take the hat off, but Rachel tries to stop him).'
Rachel	 Nah, I don't really want her to see. "
Ross	 Why not?'
Monica	 Because there are so many terrible sights in this world.'
Chandler	 Like war. Or that thing in Joey's refrigerator. Remember? It was \n  in a milk carton but it looked like meat?"
Ross	 Come here (Removes Emma's hat) Oh! There she is! Hi!"
Ross	 (sees how strangely Monica, Chandler and Rachel are looking at him) What?'
Rachel	 Nothing.'
Ross	 (Back to Emma) Hi! (Looks at her) What... (Moves the stroller away from \n  him so he can get a better look at her. He looks at her confused. Finally he \n  realizes the difference and gasps). Please tell me those are clip-ons. '
Rachel	 Oh, they're real!"
Ross	 Did she (points at Amy) do this to her? I told you we shouldn't have \n  left Emma with her!"
Rachel	 I know, I know, and you were right Ross. (To Amy)\n  You are soo irresponsible\n  I am never letting you baby-sit ever again!'
Amy	 Hey you know what, this kid needs me, okay? She needs \n  to have a cool fun aunt!'
Monica	 I'm a cool, fun aunt!"
Amy	 (Sarcastically) O-Okay!'
Chandler	 Hey! Monica can be cool and fun at organized indoor projects!'
Rachel	 I can't believe this. All I wanted to do was help you try to figure \n  out what to do with your life and this is how you repay me?"
Amy	 Well, I don't need you to help me, because I already know what I'm going \n  to do with my life."
Rachel	 Oh yeah? Since when?'
Amy	 Since today... I am going to be a baby stylist.'
Rachel	 (looks at Ross and then at Amy again in disbelief) What?'
Ross	 That's not a thing!"
Amy	 Well, it should be. I'm gonna help babies learn how to accessorize, what \n  colors to wear, what clothes are slimming..."
Rachel	 (shouting) Babies don't care if they're slim."
Amy	 Enter Amy!'
Ross	 (very angry) Amy, I ju... I just... I just wanna...'
Amy	 What? What are you gonna do?'
Ross	 (pointing at Amy, shouting) No more falafel for you!'
Mike	 Great game, huh?'
Phoebe	 Uhuh, uhuh... (seems distracted)'
Mike	 Why do you keep looking at the screen?'
Phoebe	 I'm not. I'm praying. (looking up) Please let the Knicks win... Thank \n  you Thor! (Mike is standing up) Where... where are you going?"
Mike	 Going go to the bathroom.'
Phoebe	 Well, I think you should wait.'
Mike	 Why?'
Phoebe	 Well, if you don't... if you don't hold it in, you don't get all the \n  nutrients."
Announcer	 Knicks fans, please turn your attention to the \n  big screen on the scoreboard. Someone has a special question to ask.'
Phoebe	 Mike Hannigan... will you marry me? (Mike looks bewildered)'
Announcer	 Get a load of this... She's proposing\n  to him. Guess we know who wears the pants in that family.\n  (people are laughing, while\n  Mike still seems bewildered)"
Phoebe	 That's not very enlightened!"
Phoebe	 Hey, hey! (shouting) Boo us? Boo you!'
Joey	 (picks up the phone) Hello? Yeah, this is Joey Tribbiani... \n  Oh, hi! Well, I'm glad you liked my letter... No my mommy and daddy aren't home \n  right now... (looks puzzled) Okay, bye bye. (hangs up) (to himself) She was \n  nice!"
Rachel	 Joey, get Amy's bags, she is moving out!"
Joey	 Whoo-hoo! (and leaves for Rachel's room)"
Amy	 You're kicking me out? "
Rachel	 You put holes in my baby's ears!"
Amy	 Yeah well, at least now people will know she is a girl!'
Rachel	 (gasps) I can't believe I ever even tried to help\n  you. You are so  beyond help."
Amy	 You know what? Ever since I got here, you have been nothing but negative.'
Rachel	 Excuse me?'
Amy	 You didn't want me to marry the old guy with the great apartment. Then, \n  I tried to help your daughter to de-emphasize her flaws (frantically pointing \n  at her nose) And suddenly I am the bad guy?"
Rachel	 (yelling) Joey, where are those bags?'
Joey	 (Yelling from Rachel's room) She has a lot of crap!"
Amy	 You know what? When I moved in here I thought
Rachel	 (doesn't believe what she's hearing) Seriously?"
Amy	 hm-mmm... Mom said she gained like fifteen pounds.'
Rachel	 Hips or thighs?'
Amy	 Ass and face.'
Rachel	 (gasps) Oh! Oh my God! I thought she was on Atkins.'
Amy	 She was. Carbs found her... See, this is what I wanted. Two sisters, talking \n  about real stuff.'
Rachel	 (embarrassed) Oh, I can give you that.'
Amy	 You can?'
Rachel	 Yeah. I just, I kept trying to make you a better person, but you're... \n  you're already a pretty perfect version of what you are."
Amy	 (touched) Thank you. I've got to admit, Emma does look\ncute."
Rachel	 Did you just say Emma?'
Amy	 Ugh, I'm sorry... Ella.\n"
Phoebe	 That woman at the game didn't know what she was talking \n  about. Mike, obviously you have balls."
Mike	 But please, let's just forget the whole thing."
Phoebe	 (the waiter puts a piece of cake on the table) I would love it. Consider \n  it forgotten... But just so you know... however and whenever you decide to propose, \n  I promise I'll say yes. Whether... whether, you know, it is in a basketball \n  game, or in sky writing, or you know, like some lame guy in a cheesy movie who \n  hides it in the cake."
Phoebe	 It's in the cake, isn't it?"
Mike	 (puts on a fake smile) Where else would lame Mr. No Balls hide it? (he \n  takes the ring from the cake, and cleans it with a napkin)'
Phoebe	 What's the matter with me? How do I keep ruining this? I'm sorry, I'm \n  sorry!"
Mike	 No! It's my fault. I keep trying to propose in these stupid ways and \n  all I wanna do is tell you that I love you and I want to spend the rest of my \n  life with you."
Mike	 I'm gonna do this now."
Phoebe	 Oh my God!'
Mike	 Phoebe, I...'
Phoebe	 Wait! Oh wait! (she takes off a ring that was already on her left ring \n  finger. After that Mike starts to kneel again, but then...) Oh no! (She was \n  wearing rings on all her fingers and her thumb, and takes all of these off.)'
Mike	 Ready?'
Phoebe	 Uh-huh! (and now Mike kneels properly)'
Mike	 Phoebe, I love you. There's no-one else in the world I would ask to marry \n  me... three times. But I wanna take care of you, have babies with you, and grow \n  old with you... Phoebe Buffay, will you marry me?"
Phoebe	 Yes!'
Mike	 I love you!'
Phoebe	 I love you more!'
Mike	 Not possible! (they kiss, and then Mike says proudly...) She's gonna \n  be Mrs. No Balls."

Rachel	 So how is the uhm... baby styling business going?'
Amy	 Not that great. It's almost if people don't want to hear that their babies \n  are ugly. "
Rachel	 That's shocking!"
Amy	 Oh! It's Ross... Hey Ross! (She says hey to the guy at the falafel stand, \n  whose only similarity with Ross would be his black hair.) Hello-oo Ross! (to \n  Rachel) He's rude!"
