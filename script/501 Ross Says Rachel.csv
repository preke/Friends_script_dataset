Chandler	 It could\xc2\x92ve been worse, he could\xc2\x92ve shot her.'
Ross	 (laughs) That uh, that was pretty funny. Wasn\xc2\x92t it?'

Emily	 (Yelling from inside the bathroom) You\xc2\x92ve spoiled everything!\nIt\xc2\x92s like a nightmare! My friends and family are out there! How can I face them?! How\ncan you do this to me?!'
Joey	 (To the gang) Hey, no matter what happens with Ross and Emily, we still\nget cake right?'
Ross	 (exiting the bathroom) That-that-that\xc2\x92s all right, no honey, you take\nyour time sweetie. I\xc2\x92ll be right out here. (She slams the door in his face, to the\ngang) She\xc2\x92s just fixing her makeup.'
Emily	 I hate you!!'
Ross	 And, I love you!! (He walks into the living room)'
Mr. Geller	 Boy, bad time to say the wrong name, huh Ross?'
Ross	 That\xc2\x92s true, thanks dad. (To All) People should be dancing! Huh? Hey,\nthis is a party! Come on! Joey, dance!! (He starts to dance but stops when no one else\njoins him.)'
Mrs. Waltham	 Yes, Waltham interiors.'
Phoebe	 (On the phone, in New York) Uh, hello, this is Ross Geller\xc2\x92s\npersonal physician, Dr. Philange.'
Mrs. Waltham	 Who?'
Phoebe	 Yeah, I\xc2\x92ve discovered that Ross forgot to take his brain medicine,\nuh, now without it, uh, in the brain of Ross, uh women\xc2\x92s names are interchangeable,\nthrough-through no fault of his own.'
Mrs. Waltham	 Oh my God, Phoebe.'
Phoebe	 No, not Phoebe, Dr. Philange. Oh no! You have it too!'
Phoebe	 Hello?'
Chandler	 Hey.'
Monica	 Hey.'
Chandler	 Oh wow, I hope you don\xc2\x92t take this the wrong way but, I know we\nhad plans to meet up tonight and, ugh, I\xc2\x92m just kinda worried about what it might do\nto our friendship.'
Monica	 I know. How could we have let this happen?'
Chandler	 Seven times!'
Monica	 Ugh! Well, y\xc2\x92know, we were away\xc2\x85'
Chandler	 In a foreign, romantic country\xc2\x85'
Monica	 I blame London.'
Chandler	 Bad London! (Takes a spoon and smacks the turkey.)'
Monica	 So look umm, while we\xc2\x92re st-still in London, I mean, we can keep\ndoing it right?'
Chandler	 Well, I don\xc2\x92t see that we have a choice. But, when we\xc2\x92re\nback home, we don\xc2\x92t do it.'
Monica	 Only here.'
Chandler	 Y\xc2\x92know, I saw a wine cellar downstairs\xc2\x85'
Monica	 I\xc2\x92ll meet you there in two minutes.'
Chandler	 Okay! '
Rachel	 Mon, honey, I gotta ask you something.'
Monica	 (impatiently) Now?'
Rachel	 Ross said my name up there, I mean, come on, I just can\xc2\x92t pretend\nthat didn\xc2\x92t happen can I?'
Monica	 Oh, I-I don\xc2\x92t know.'
Rachel	 Monica, what should I do?'
Monica	 Just uh, do the right thing. (Uses some breath spray)'
Rachel	 What?'
Monica	 Toe the line. Thread the needle. Think outside the box! (Tries to leave,\nbut is stopped by Rachel.)'
Rachel	 Whoa, wait, listen, I think I\xc2\x92m just gonna talk to Ross about what\nhe think it meant.'
Monica	 Wait. Rachel, no, he\xc2\x92s married. Married! If you don\xc2\x92t realize\nthat, I can\xc2\x92t help you.'
Rachel	 Okay, you\xc2\x92re right. You\xc2\x92re right. You can\xc2\x92t help me.'
Mrs. Geller	 Jack, is it all our fault? Were we bad parents?'
Mr. Waltham	 (walking by) Yes.'
Mr. Geller	 Oh yeah, well who serves steak when there\xc2\x92s no place to sit, I\nmean how are you supposed to eat this?'
Joey	 Hey, what\xc2\x92s up? (He has solved the problem of eating the steak,\nhe\xc2\x92s eating it with his hands.)'
Monica	 Where were you? We were supposed to meet in the wine cellar?'
Chandler	 Forget it, that\xc2\x92s off.'
Monica	 Why?!'
Mr. Waltham	 (drunkenly) The next tour of the wine cellar will plan in two in-in\nminutes\xc2\x85'
Monica	 Joey, what are you doing? You promised Phoebe you wouldn\xc2\x92t eat meat\nuntil she has the babies!'
Joey	 Well, I figured we\xc2\x92re in another country, so it doesn\xc2\x92t count.'
Monica	 That\xc2\x92s true.'
Chandler	 The man\xc2\x92s got a point.'
Rachel	 Oh, hi!'
Ross	 Hi!'
Rachel	 Hi. Sorry, things aren\xc2\x92t working out so well.'
Ross	 Oh no! It could be better, but it\xc2\x92s gonna be okay, right?'
Rachel	 Oh yeah! Of course, I mean, she\xc2\x92s gonna get over this, y\xc2\x92know?\nI mean, so you said my name! Y\xc2\x92know you just said it \xc2\x91cause you saw me there, if\nyou\xc2\x92d have seen a circus freak, you would\xc2\x92ve said, "I take thee circus\nfreak." Y\xc2\x92know, it didn\xc2\x92t mean anything, it\xc2\x92s just a mistake. It\ndidn\xc2\x92t mean anything. Right?'
Ross	 No! No! Of course it didn\xc2\x92t mean anything! I mean, uh well, I can\nunderstand why Emily would think it meant something, y\xc2\x92know, because-because it was\nyou\xc2\x85'
Rachel	 Right\xc2\x85'
Ross	 But it absolutely didn\xc2\x92t. (Yelling towards the bathroom) It\ndidn\xc2\x92t!! It didn\xc2\x92t!!'
Joey	 (approaching) Ross, hey, the band\xc2\x92s ready outside for your first\ndance with Emily, so\xc2\x85'
Ross	 (sarcastic) Oh! Oh-oh, the band\xc2\x92s ready! Well, I-I-we gotta do what\nthe band says\xc2\x97I don\xc2\x92t care about the stupid band!!'
Joey	 You spit on me man! (Wipes his face.)'
Ross	 Look, I\xc2\x92m sorry.'
Joey	 Emily is kinda taking a long time, huh?'
Rachel	 (laughs) Y\xc2\x92know when I locked myself in the bathroom at my wedding,\nit was because I was trying to pop the window out of the frame.'
Ross	 Oh, right!'
Rachel	 Get the hell out of there, y\xc2\x92know?'
Ross	 (Bangs on the bathroom door) Emily? Emily? I\xc2\x92m coming in. (He opens\nthe door to reveal that the window is gone, along with Emily.)'
Rachel	 Well, look at that, same thing.'
Chandler	 Listen, in the middle of everything if I scream the word,\n"Yippee!" just ignore me.'
Monica	 Oh my God, Rachel! Hi!'
Chandler	 Oh, hello Rachel.'
Rachel	 Ross said my name. Okay? My name. Ross said my name up there that\nobviously means that he still loves me! (They both just stare at her.) Okay, don\xc2\x92t\nbelieve me, I know I\xc2\x92m right\xc2\x97do you guys want to go downstairs and get a drink?'
Chandler	 Yes, we do. But, we have to change first.'
Monica	 Yes, I want to change. And why-why don\xc2\x92t you go down and get us a\ntable?'
Chandler	 Yeah, we\xc2\x92ll be down in like five minutes.'
Monica	 (elbows him) Fifteen minutes.'
Rachel	 Okay.'
Rachel	 Hello? Oh, Pheebs! (To them) It\xc2\x92s Phoebe!'
Chandler	 Oh, yay\xc2\x85'
Monica	 Great\xc2\x85'
Rachel	 Hi!'
Phoebe	 Hi, so what happened?'
Rachel	 Well, Ross said my name.'
Phoebe	 Yeah, I know, but I don\xc2\x92t think that means anything.'
Rachel	 Okay, Pheebs, y\xc2\x92know what, let\xc2\x92s look at this objectively all\nright? Ninth grade, right? The obsession starts. All right? The summer after ninth grade\nhe sees me in a two-piece for the first time, his obsession begins to grow. So then\xc2\x85'
Chandler	 (To Monica) Hey, listen, why don\xc2\x92t we go change in my room?'
Monica	 But my clothes are\xc2\x97ohh! (They both leave.)'
Chandler	 Wow, you look\xc2\x85'
Monica	 No time for that!'
Joey	 Hey, dude, let me in. I got a girl out here!'
Chandler	 Well, I\xc2\x92ve got a girl in here.'
Joey	 No you don\xc2\x92t, I just saw you go in there with Monica!'
Chandler	 Well, we\xc2\x92re-we\xc2\x92re hanging out in here!'
Joey	 Look, which one of us is gonna be having sex in there, me or you?'
Chandler	 Well, I suppose I\xc2\x92d have to say you!! But, what if we\xc2\x92re\nwatching a movie in here?'
Monica	 Which we are, and-and we already paid for it. It\xc2\x92s My Giant!'
Joey	 My Giant? I love that movie!'
Monica	 You really think this is okay?'
Chandler	 Well, Ross and Emily aren\xc2\x92t gonna use it.'
Monica	 Oh, it\xc2\x92s so beautiful. Ohh! Y\xc2\x92know, I-I don\xc2\x92t know if I\nfeel right about this.'
Chandler	 Oh Mon-Mon-Mon-Mon-look, this is the honeymoon suite. The room\nexpects sex. The room would be disappointed if it didn\xc2\x92t get sex. All of the\nother honeymoon suites would think it was a loser.'
Monica	 Okay!'
Chandler	 Okay!'
Ross	 (entering) Emily?!'
Chandler	 Nope, not under here!'
Monica	 You didn\xc2\x92t find her?'
Ross	 No, I\xc2\x92ve looked everywhere!'
Chandler	 Well, you couldn\xc2\x92t have looked everywhere or else you\nwould\xc2\x92ve found her!'
Monica	 Yeah, I think you should keep looking!'
Chandler	 Yeah, for about 30 minutes.'
Monica	 Or 45.'
Chandler	 Wow, in 45 minutes you can find her twice. (Monica smiles at that.)'
Ross	 No! For all I know, she\xc2\x92s trying to find me but couldn\xc2\x92t because\nI kept moving around. No, from now on, I\xc2\x92m staying in one place. (He sits down on the\nbed.) Right here.'
Monica	 Well, it\xc2\x92s getting late.'
Chandler	 Yeah, we\xc2\x92re gonna go.'
Ross	 Actually, do you guys mind staying here for a while?'
Monica	 Ugh, y\xc2\x92know, umm we gotta get up early and catch that plane for New\nYork.'
Chandler	 Yeah, it\xc2\x92s a very large plane.'
Ross	 (disappointed) That\xc2\x92s cool.'
Chandler	 But, we\xc2\x92ll stay here with you.'
Ross	 Thanks guys! (They both sit down on either side of him.) I really\nappreciate this, y\xc2\x92know, but you don\xc2\x92t have to rub my butt.'

Chandler	 We have to leave for New York in an hour.'
Monica	 I know, I\xc2\x92ve been looking at those doors, they look pretty sound\nproof, don\xc2\x92t you think?'
Chandler	 We can\xc2\x92t do that that\xc2\x92s insane. I mean \xc2\x91A\xc2\x92 he\ncould wake up and \xc2\x91B\xc2\x92 y\xc2\x92know, let\xc2\x92s go for it.'
Ross	 Em-Emily? (Looking around for her.) Em-Emily? (He runs to the door.)\nEmily! (He opens the door to reveal the Walthams standing outside.)'
Mr. Waltham	 No.'
Mrs. Waltham	 You can forget about Emily, she\xc2\x92s not with us.'
Mr. Waltham	 We\xc2\x92ve come for her things.'
Ross	 Wait, well wh-wh-wh-where is she?'
Mr. Waltham	 She\xc2\x92s in hiding. She\xc2\x92s utterly humiliated. She\ndoesn\xc2\x92t want to see you ever again.'
Mrs. Waltham	 We\xc2\x92re very sad that it didn\xc2\x92t work out between you and\nEmily, monkey. But, I think you\xc2\x92re absolutely delicious.'
Mr. Waltham	 Excuse me, I\xc2\x92m standing right here!'
Mrs. Waltham	 Oh yes, there you are.'
Rachel	 (entering, carrying an armful of those little soaps.) Hey-hey, you guys\noh hurry up, get some, there\xc2\x92s a whole cart outside\xc2\x85 (Sees the Walthams and\nstops.)'
Mr. Waltham	 Goodbye Geller.'
Ross	 Now, hold on! Hold on! (Stops him) Look, look, your daughter and I are\nsupposed to leave tonight for our honeymoon, now-now you-you tell her that I\xc2\x92m gonna\nbe at that airport and I hope that she\xc2\x92ll be there too! Oh yeah, I said Rachel\xc2\x92s\nname, but it didn\xc2\x92t mean anything, Okay? She\xc2\x92s-she\xc2\x92s just a friend and\nthat\xc2\x92s all! (Rachel sits down, depressed.) That\xc2\x92s all! Now just tell Emily that\nI love her and that I can\xc2\x92t imagine spending my life with anyone else. Please,\npromise me that you\xc2\x92ll tell her that.'
Mr. Waltham	 All right, I\xc2\x92ll tell her. (To his wife) Come on bugger face!'
Mrs. Waltham	 (As she walks pass Ross, she pats his but.) Call me.'
Mr. Waltham	 You spend half your life in the bathroom, why don\xc2\x92t you ever\ngo out the bloody window!'
Monica	 Y\xc2\x92know, maybe it\xc2\x92s best that we never got to do it again.'
Chandler	 Yeah, it kinda makes that-that one night special. (Realizes something)\nY\xc2\x92know, technically we still are over international waters.'
Monica	 I\xc2\x92m gonna go to the bathroom, maybe I\xc2\x92ll see you there in a\nbit?'
Chandler	 \xc2\x91Kay!'
Joey	 Can I ask you something?'
Chandler	 Uhh, no.'
Joey	 Felicity and I, we\xc2\x92re watching My Giant, and I was thinking,\n"I\xc2\x92m never gonna be as good an actor as that giant." Do you think I\xc2\x92m\njust wasting my life with this acting thing?'
Chandler	 No.'
Joey	 I mean, the giant is like five years younger than me, y\xc2\x92know, you\nthink I\xc2\x92ll ever get there?'
Chandler	 Yes.'
Joey	 Thanks man. '
Chandler	 Okay man. (Chandler starts to get up.)'
Joey	 But what about how much taller he is than me?'
Joey	 I mean, there\xc2\x92s no way I can make myself taller now, y\xc2\x92know? And\nwho knows what science will come up with in the future, but Chandler, what if I die an\nunsuccessful, regular sized man?'
Joey	 Hey, Monica, wow you\xc2\x92ve been in the bathroom for like a half-hour.'
Monica	 I know!'
Joey	 Had the beef-tips, huh?'
Phoebe	 Hey!'
Chandler	 Hey!'
Joey	 Hi!'
Phoebe	 (To Joey) You ate meat! (Joey is shocked) (To Chandler and Monica) You\nhad sex! (They\xc2\x92re shocked.)'
Chandler	 No we didn\xc2\x92t!'
Phoebe	 I know you didn\xc2\x92t, I was talking about Monica.'
Monica	 Phoebe, I did not have sex.'
Phoebe	 This pregnancy is throwing me all off.'
Joey	 All right, I\xc2\x92m gonna go say hi the chick and the duck.'
Phoebe	 Oh, me too!'
Joey	 Why would you need to say hi to them, you\xc2\x92ve been feeding them for\nfour days?'
Phoebe	 Oh right, maybe I\xc2\x92ll just go home. '
Monica	 Well, we certainly are alone.'
Chandler	 Yes! Good thing we have that, \xc2\x91Not in New York\xc2\x92 rule.'
Monica	 Right. Umm, listen since we\xc2\x92re-we-re on that subject, umm, I just\nwanted to tell you that uh, well, I-I was going through a really hard time in London, what\nwith my brother getting married and that guy thinking I was Ross\xc2\x92s mother\xc2\x85'
Chandler	 Right.'
Monica	 Well, an-anyway, I just\xc2\x97that night meant a lot to me, I guess\nI\xc2\x92m just trying to say thanks.'
Chandler	 Oh. Y\xc2\x92know, that night meant a lot to me too, and it wasn\xc2\x92t\nbecause I was in a bad place or anything, it just meant a lot to me \xc2\x91cause,\nyou\xc2\x92re really hot! Is that okay?'
Monica	 (laughs) That\xc2\x92s okay.'
Chandler	 And I\xc2\x92m cute too.'
Monica	 And you\xc2\x92re cute too.'
Chandler	 Thank you! (They hug.) All right, I gotta go unpack.'
Monica	 Okay.'
Chandler	 Bye. '
Chandler	 (entering) I\xc2\x92m still on London time, does that count?'
Monica	 That counts!'
Chandler	 Oh, good! (They start kissing.)'
Ross	 Rach! Rach!'
Rachel	 (she stops and turns) Hi!'
Ross	 Hi! What are you, what are you doing here?'
Rachel	 Well, I-I-I\xc2\x92ve been on Standby for a flight home for hours. '
Ross	 Oh.'
Rachel	 Ohh, so no sign of Emily huh?'
Ross	 Not yet.'
Rachel	 So umm, what time are you supposed to leave?'
Gate Agent	 (On the P.A.) This is the last call for Flight 1066 to\nAthens. The last call.'
Ross	 Pretty soon I guess.'
Rachel	 Yeah. I\xc2\x92m sorry.'
Ross	 I just, I don\xc2\x92t understand, I mean, how-how can she do this?\nY\xc2\x92know, what, am I, am I like a complete idiot for thinking that she\xc2\x92d actually\nshow up?'
Rachel	 No, you\xc2\x92re not an idiot, Ross. You\xc2\x92re a guy very much in love.'
Ross	 Same difference.'
Gate Agent	 (On the P.A.) All ticketed passengers for Flight 1066 to\nAthens should now be on board.'
Ross	 I get it! Well, that\xc2\x92s that.'
Rachel	 No, you know what, I think you should go.'
Ross	 What?'
Rachel	 Yeah, I do. I think you should go, by yourself, get some distance, clear\nyour head, I think it\xc2\x92d be really good.'
Ross	 Oh, I don\xc2\x92t, I don\xc2\x92t, I don\xc2\x92t know\xc2\x85'
Rachel	 Oh, come on Ross! I think it would be really good for you!'
Ross	 I could, yeah, I can do that.'
Rachel	 Yeah.'

Rachel	 Good!'
Ross	 I know, why not?'
Rachel	 Right!'
Ross	 Right?'
Rachel	 Right!'
Ross	 Y\xc2\x92know\xc2\x97thanks! (They hug)'

Ross	 Yeah, well\xc2\x85nah.'
Rachel	 What? Wait, what?'
Ross	 Why don\xc2\x92t you come, I mean, I-I have two tickets, why not?'
Rachel	 Well-well, I don\xc2\x92t know Ross\xc2\x97really?'
Ross	 Yeah, yeah, it\xc2\x92ll be great! You can, you can lay on the beach and I\ncan cry over my failed marriage. See-see how I make jokes?'
Rachel	 Uh-huh.'
Ross	 No really, I mean, I mean, God, I could use a friend.'
Rachel	 Oh wow, uh okay, uh maybe. Umm, yes, I can do that!'
Ross	 Okay!'
Rachel	 Okay!'
Ross	 Cool!'
Rachel	 All right!'
Ross	 Come on! (They go to the jetway, Ross hands the tickets to the gate\nagent.) Here. '
Rachel	 Oh, okay, we\xc2\x92re going. Yeah.'
Ross	 Ah! Ah! I forgot my jacket!'
Rachel	 Oh, wait-wait-wait\xc2\x85'
Ross	 You tell them to wait!'
Rachel	 Okay. Wait! Wait!'
Ross	 Emily.'
Ross	 Oh no-no-no! Oh-no! (Emily starts to run out and Ross chases her.) No! No!\nEmily!'

Rachel	 Ahh, yes, I will have a glass of the Merlot and uh, (points to\nRoss\xc2\x92s seat.) he will have a white wine spritzer. Woo! (Looks out the window.) Hey,\nlook at that, the airport\xc2\x92s moving. (Realizes that that\xc2\x92s not how it works.)\nHey, are we moving?! Are we moving? Why are we moving? Hey, time-out, umm, yeah, does the\ncaptain know that we\xc2\x92re moving? (Sits back in defeat.) Oh my God. Oh, my gosh.'
