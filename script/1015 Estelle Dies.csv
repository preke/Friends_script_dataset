Jennifer	 Previously on Friends...'
Chandler	 How did the job stuff go?'
Rachel	 He offered me one.'
Ross	 (gasps) You know what? This calls for a bottle of Israels finest.'
Rachel	 The job is in Paris. (we see Ross stare in disbelief)'

Rachel	 Oh, God! Please, somebody  say something.'
Ross	 So if you take this job you'll be moving to Paris?"
Chandler	 Or facing a bitch of a commute.'
Rachel	 I know, it's huge, and it's scary, and it's... really far, far away \n  from you guys, but this is such an incredible opportunity for me. And I've already \n  talked to them about our situation with Emma, and they said they'll do whatever \n  we need to make us feel comfortable."
Ross	 Okay.'
Rachel	 I mean, I'll fly back and forth, they'll fly you out... \n  Anything we want."
Chandler	 My boss said I might be getting a new lamp in my cubicle. (Monica \n  looks at him and can't really place what he just said)"
Ross	 All right, we'll work it out."
Rachel	 Thank you! Thank you!'
Ross	 Yeah, yeah! (they hug) You sure this is what you want?'
Rachel	 I think it is. (Ross looks very sad. Phoebe \n  and Joey enter.)'
Phoebe	 Ooh, what's going on?"
Rachel	 I got a really incredible job offer.'
Joey	 Hey, great! All right!'
Phoebe	 Good for you!'
Rachel	 It's in Paris."
Joey	 What? No, no, no! No, no... no... no, no... No, too much is changing, \n  okay? First, Phoebe getting married (to Phoebe) Congratulations! (pointing to \n  Monica and Chandler)... and then these two move into a stupid house in the stupid \n  suburbs...'
Monica	 Hey, this afternoon you said you'd be supportive..."
Joey	 Well, it comes and goes. I wouldn't trust it."
Rachel	 Look, you guys... this is really, really important to me. And it means \n  a lot if you could try to get on board.'
Phoebe	 Of course we can. Congratulations. (they hug, but Joey shakes his head.) \n  Yay! (she gestures Joey to come and join in) Joey...'
Joey	 No, no, no. My hugs are reserved for people STAYING IN AMERICA.'
Rachel	 (walking towards Joey) Joey, it would mean so...'
Joey	 Hey! No! Get your France-going-arms away from me. (He walks out, and \n  Rachel follows him)'
Rachel	 Joey...'
Phoebe	 You okay with this?'
Chandler	 Well, it makes me feel sad, but...'
Phoebe	 Talking to Ross.'
Chandler	 I see.'
Ross	 Well, Rachel moving to another country? Not being able to see her every \n  day. How can I be okay with this?'
Monica	 I know, but what are we gonna do? She really needs this job.'
Ross	 Do you think if the Ralph Lauren people offered her her old job back, \n  she would take it?'
Monica	 How is that gonna happen?'
Chandler	 Is this the best way to use one of your three magic wishes?'
Ross	 I don't know. I could talk to her boss. Yeah! I met him at that Christmas \n  party. We really hit it off."
Monica	 You mean the guy who kept calling you Ron?'
Ross	 I didn't say we were brothers."

Monica	 Hey Phoebe. Hey, tell me what you think. All right. The house next \n  door to the one that we're buying in Westchester? Just went on the market. I wanna \n  take a look at it, but Chandler doesn't."
Chandler	 We close escrow tomorrow, so seeing another house can only confuse \n  us, and we're easily confused. We're not very bright."
Monica	 But what if it is better than ours? Should we at least look?'
Chandler	 What do you think Pheebs?'
Phoebe	 Well, I think that shirt makes you look like you should work at a Baskin \n  Robbins... Anyway... Hey, isn't Joey's agent Estelle Leonard?"
Chandler	 Yeah.'
Phoebe	 She died.'
Chandler	 You're kidding!"
Monica	 That's terrible!"
Phoebe	 Yeah, last Saturday. Wow! She was the first black man to fly solo across \n  the Atlantic. (Chandler and Monica look puzzled) Oh, wait a minute, I read the \n  wrong one.'
Chandler	 Oh yeah? '
Phoebe	 Yeah, she was just an agent.'
Monica	 Joey's gonna be *so* upset. "
Chandler	 I know. *He* always wanted to be the first black man to cross the \n  Atlantic.'
Phoebe	 Well, we cannot tell Joey about this. He's already flipping out about \n  everything that's changing. This will push him over the edge."
Monica	 Seriously, you don't think we should tell him?"
Phoebe	 Well, not for a little while. Let's just give him a few days to get \n  used to everything else."
Monica	 What if he reads it in the paper?'
Chandler	 Unless Snoopy says it to Charlie Brown, I think we're okay.\n"
Ross	 Yeah, I'm a friend of Rachel Green's. Uhm, actually we met at the Christmas \n  party about two years ago."
Mr Zelner	 Oh right, uhm, Don?'
Ross	 Close. Ron. (shakes hands)'
Mr Zelner	 Uh... What can I do for you?'
Ross	 Uhm, well... I'm here to see if you'll give Rachel her job back."
Mr Zelner	 Ah, did she ask you to come here and do this?'
Ross	 Oh, no. At first I have to get you to agree. Then we'll \n  see if she wants to come back."
Mr Zelner	 Wow, that is tempting. '
Ross	 Look, she loved her job here. And let's face \n  it
Mr Zelner	 She is good!'
Ross	 (surprised) Huh, I took a shot there.'
Mr Zelner	 But I'm sorry. There's nothing I can do... Ah, \n  it's not true, there is... nothing I want to do."
Ross	 I see... Thanks very much. (he gets up and walks to the door. On his \n  way out he looks at the photographs Mr Zelner has near his door. He picks one \n  up.) Is this your son?\n'
Mr Zelner	 Yeah, his name is Ross. (Ross looks very surprised) What?'
Ross	 Oh, nothing, it\xe2\x80\x99s just, it\xe2\x80\x99s close to Ron. Does he.. Does \n  little Ross like dinosaurs by any chance? '
Mr Zelner	 Yeah, they're all he talks about, why?"
Ross	 How would he like to come with me to the Museum of Natural History after \n  everyone else has left, just the two of us, and he can touch anything he wants. \n  (Mr. Zellner looks shocked). I just heard it as you must have heard it and that\xe2\x80\x99s \n  not good. Let me start again. I\xe2\x80\x99m a paleontologist, you\xe2\x80\x99ll be there \n  with us and the touching refers only to bones\xe2\x80\xa6 fossils!'
Mr Zelner	 You can really arrange that?'
Ross	 You let Rachel come back, and it\xe2\x80\x99s done. '
Mr Zelner	 Well, I guess having Rachel back wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be the worst thing \n  in the world.'
Ross	 Yeah! Yes! Thank you! This is great. Thank you so much. And I swear, \n  your kid is going to have the time of his life.'
Mr Zelner	 That\xe2\x80\x99s great. I worry about little Ross. He\xe2\x80\x99s always \n  reading, he's collecting rocks and he\xe2\x80\x99s obsessed with dinosaurs."
Ross	 He\xe2\x80\x99ll be fine.\n'
Joey	 Hey Phoebe.'
Phoebe	 Hey. Everything ok?'
Joey	 I\xe2\x80\x99m just mad at my agent.'
Phoebe	 Estelle? Why?'
Joey	 There\xe2\x80\x99s a part in a TV movie that I would be perfect for and I \n  didn\xe2\x80\x99t even be put up for it! She\xe2\x80\x99d better have a good reason.'
Phoebe	 I\xe2\x80\x99m guessing she does.'
 Joey	 Well (taking his cell phone out of a pocket) I\xe2\x80\x99m wanna hear it, \n  because she keeps doing this.'
Phoebe	 Well, no, no, wait, wait, wait. All right, I gotta go. Just listen. Promise me, that you \n  will wait a minute before you call her.'
Joey	 Ok. Why?'
Phoebe	 Because a promise between friends means never having to give a reason. \n  (she leaves)'
Joey	 I love that saying!'
Joey	 Hello?'
Phoebe (doing Estelle)	 Joey, it\xe2\x80\x99s Estelle.'
Joey	 I was just gonna call you! That\xe2\x80\x99s weird.'
Phoebe-Estelle	 It\xe2\x80\x99s a little coincidental, but believable. \n  (Joey nods in agreement). Listen, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you\xe2\x80\x99re wondering why \n  I didn\xe2\x80\x99t get you an audition for that TV movie.'
Joey	 Yeah, actually I am!'
Phoebe-Estelle	 I guess I dropped the ball there. Whoopsie! \n'
Joey	 That\xe2\x80\x99s it? You know, it seems all you do lately is drop the ball.'
Phoebe-Estelle	 Don\xe2\x80\x99t take that tone with me. Who you \n  think you are? Alan Lemond, the first black man to fly solo across the Atlantic?'
Joey	 No, no, look. All I\xe2\x80\x99m saying is that you\xe2\x80\x99re my agent, ok? \n  And you\xe2\x80\x99re not getting me into any auditions and I\xe2\x80\x99m tired of it.'
Phoebe-Estelle	 What are you saying?'
Joey	 I\xe2\x80\x99m saying that\xe2\x80\xa6 (pause). This isn't  working for me \n  anymore, ok? Estelle, you\xe2\x80\x99re fired. Goodbye. (he hangs up the phone)."
Phoebe	 Man, tough week for Estelle!'
Ross	 Hi.'
Rachel	 Hi.'
Ross	 Emma left her stuffed t-rex at my house. You know she can\xe2\x80\x99t sleep \n  without it.'
Rachel	 Oh, well, she\xe2\x80\x99s asleep now. Stop forcing that thing on her.'
Ross	 Ok.'
Rachel	 Oh, you\xe2\x80\x99re not gonna believe what happened to me today! Ralph \n  Lauren called, and gave me my job back!'
Ross	 Nooo!'
Rachel	 Yee. I mean, it was so weirdest thing. They fired me and then out \n  of nowhere they just hire me back! I mean, that place must have been falling \n  apart without me.'
Ross	 So, you\xe2\x80\x99re not going to Paris.'
Rachel	 No, I\xe2\x80\x99m still going.'
Ross	 Wh\xe2\x80\xa6 wh\xe2\x80\xa6what?'
Rachel	 When the Louis Vuitton people found out that Ralph Lauren wanted me back, \n  the offered me more money! Isn\xe2\x80\x99t that great?'
Ross	 Yeeeah! (They high-five) '
Lady	 Oh, sure. I\xe2\x80\x99m showing it to someone else right now, \n  but please, look around.'
Monica	 Thanks.'
Chandler	 It feels like we\xe2\x80\x99re cheating on our house. \n  And if we\xe2\x80\x99re gonna cheat, shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t it be with like a hot, younger house, \n  that does stuff that our house won\xe2\x80\x99t do?'
Monica	 Ours is so much better! This living room is smaller, the dining room looks \n  like a cave! What a hole!'
Lady	 So? What do you think?'
Monica	 Love it!'
Lady	 Well, we already have one offer on it, and I think the lady \n  upstairs is goning to make another one.'
Monica	 They could be our neighbors, what are they like?'
Lady	 Oh, the woman upstairs is very nice. She and her husband have two kids, \n  he's on Wall Street and she\xe2\x80\xa6"
Janice	 Oh my God!'
Chandler (to Monica)	 Sure.\n'
Phoebe	 Hey Joey, want come with me to\xe2\x80\xa6 are you ok?'
Joey	 Yeah, I just\xe2\x80\xa6 I just feel bad about firing Estelle. This is got to be \n  killing her.'
Phoebe	 No, that wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t kill her. Ordinary embolism might.'
Joey	 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. She\xe2\x80\x99s got to be taking it hard, I was like \n  her only client. Except for this guy who eats paper. And I\xe2\x80\x99m guessing \n  he eats more money than he makes. Look, I know she\xe2\x80\x99s not a great agent, but \n  she did stick with me for ten years. I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna call her and hire her again.'
Phoebe	 No, no, no! Don't call her! You wait for her to call \n  you (Joey considers it)"
Joey	 Why?'
Phoebe	 Because patience is the road to understanding (she thinks) which ... \n  is the key... to a happy heart.'
Joey	 (impressed) You blow me away. '
Phoebe	 (picking up her bag) All right, so promise you're gonna wait for her \n  to call you?"
Joey	 I promise. And that means, never having to give a reason. (Phoebe stops \n  herself from laughing and leaves)'
Chandler	 And yet I never run into Beyonce!'
Janice	 Oh, we go way back. Before Monica made an honest man \n  out of him, Chandler used to be my little love muffin! (does her irritating \n  laugh). So? Are you guys thinking of getting this house too? Ooh! Are we gonna \n  have a bidding war? I'd better warn you, I'm a toughie (playfully punches Chandler, \n  who tries to get away from her)"
Chandler	 (at Janice's punching) Don't, don't! (looks disgusted)"
Monica	 No, actually, we're buying the house next door. (Janice gasps)"
Chandler	 (To Monica and with bulging eyes) Why!?'
Monica	 (looks confused and scared) I don't know \n  why."
Janice	 Ooh, that decides it then. I was on the fence. \n  But knowing that you two would be our neighbors? Ah! now we have to \n  get it! (Chandler and Monica are utterly shocked) Ellen, we're going to talk \n  numbers. (Grabs Ellen by her elbow and pulls her outside) "
Chandler	 This can not be happening!'
Monica	 Okay, the realtor said another couple made an offer. \n  Maybe the Janice's won't get it! Maybe the other couple will."
Chandler	 The only way that that is going to happen, is if the other couple \n  are the Hitlers.'
Monica	 (Thinks a little more) Okay, Okay, (clapping her hands) \n  All right. What if we got both houses? Huh? We can turn this house \n  into a guest house.'
Chandler	 That is a great idea! And by the way, I don't mean to sound distasteful, \n  but when did you start crapping money!?"
Monica	 Okay, you come up with an idea.'
Chandler	 Alright alright, we still have three hours till escrow closes on \n  our house. We can still get out.'
Monica	 But we love our house.'
Chandler	 Will we love it so much with her next door? And she\'s gonna be louder \n  out here too. Just the crickets and (apes Janice\'s voice) "Oh My God"! \n'
Monica	 Okay, but if we don't get this house, she's stil gonna show up wherever \n  we go! I mean, at least if she's here, it eliminates the element of suprise. \n  I mean, never again will you have to hear the three words that make your balls \n  jump back up inside your body. (She shows this with her index finger, mimicking \n  it pushing something up)"
Chandler	 (looks afraid, but at the same time, knows she's right) Well, we \n  have to do something. We can't have her living next door. (Janice's laughs loudly \n  outside) Oh, that does it too. (Motions with his index finger like Monica did)"
r Zelner	 Who is it?'
Ross	 (enters) It's me. Ron. (Mr. Zellner looks annoyed) \n  Look, I um, I now Rachel turned you down but I think there is a way you might \n  be able to get her to come back. "
Mr Zelner	 This may surprise you, but re-hiring fired employees, \n  is not my main job.'
Ross	 Just hear me out. How would you feel about offering her a raise? (looks \n  hopeful)'
Mr Zelner	 (obviously amused) Not good, Ron. '
Ross	 Perhaps I can persuade you. What if you can give your son this (Takes \n  a huge egg out of his back) genuine pterodactyl egg (whispers) replica.'
Mr Zelner	 (Takes a long look at the egg while he considers it) Wow, that's \n  pretty cool (Takes the egg from Ross)"
Ross	 Huh? So? We have a deal?'
Mr Zelner	 Okay, you got it.'
Ross	 Yes! yes! '
Mr Zelner	 This is gonna make me very popular.'
Ross	 Oh, (grins) Believe me, the ladies, they love it!'
Mr Zelner	 (looks at Ross, for a long moment, confused) I meant with my son.'
Ross	 Good, 'cause the ladies, not so much. (shakes his head, give him a thumbs \n  up and leaves)"
Joey	 Oh my God. (Still in shock when his mobile rings, he picks it up) Hello?'
Phoebe	 (on the other side of the line, still pretending to be Estelle) Joey, \n  it's Estelle. (Joey's eyes bulge up, he looks afraid)"
Joey	 Estelle?'
Phoebe	 Yeah, I wanted to call and tell you that there's no hard feelings for \n  firing me."
Joey	 (still scared) Ok-ay. I just, I can't believe you're calling me?"
Phoebe	 Well, I didn't think I should just drop by..."
Joey	 No, no, no! (Starts looking around the room, terrified) Don't drop by, \n  don't drop by!"
Phoebe	 Anyway, you did what you had to do. I'm okay."
Joey	 Can I ask you something? Uhm, what's it like there?"
Phoebe	 (Looks around) It's alright. Look kiddo, I gotta go. Good luck with \n  the career. You're gonna be huge."
Joey	 Thanks for everything Estelle. Bye. (Hangs up and reads the phone display) \n  "out of area". Boy, I\'ll say.'
Chandler	 The Hitlers will be so disappointed.'
Janice	 All right, I got to run. Tell Monica I say goodbye. And... I'll see \n  you later, neighbor. (Janice laugh)"
Chandler	 Wait! I just want you to know that... I'm so happy you're going to \n  be here."
Janice	 Oh, me too... (laughs)'
Chandler	 Because... that way... we can pick up where we left off.'
Janice	 Huh?'
Chandler	 I never stopped loving you.'
Janice	 Oh... my...'
Chandler	 Yeah, yeah, yeah! I want you... I need you... I must have you Janice \n  Litman Goralnik Neihosenstein.'
Janice	 Chandler, what are you talking about?'
Chandler	 Now that you live next door, we can be together every day. Sid and \n  Monica never have to know a thing.'
Janice	 I don't know what to say... I mean, you know, obviously we have this... \n  heat between us."
Chandler	 (stunned) Obviously.'
Janice	 But I love my husband. And I know you love your wife. Now, I don't \n  think we should get this house now."
Chandler	 Don't say that. Don't tangle the dream and take it away."
Janice	 Chandler, one of us has got to be strong.'
Chandler	 I understand.'
Janice	 Although, maybe just... one last moment of weakness... (she kisses \n  Chandler flat on the mouth. Chandler squirms. When she's finished, he looks \n  at her lovingly but uneasily.) Goodbye Chandler Bing. (She leaves)"
Chandler	 (speaking as in pain) They're never coming down now."
Rachel	 Hi!'
Ross	 Hey!'
Rachel	 You are never going to believe what happened to me today.'
Ross	 What?'
Rachel	 Ralph Lauren called again and they offered \n  me more money.'
Ross	 They did?'
Rachel	 Yeah. It was the weirdest thing. Zelner called me and he said we'll \n  do everything we can to get you back. And that I should thank some Ron... I \n  don't even know what department that guy's in."
Ross	 So, what are you gonna do?'
Rachel	 Well, I took it.'
Ross	 That's great! So you're staying in New York!"
Both	 YAY! WHOO! YAY!'
Ross	 You're excited, right?"
Rachel	 (hesitant) Ye-ah. Yeah! You know, the money's great. \n  It's certainly the easier choice..."
Ross	 Right!'
Rachel	 Yeah, you know, was I looking forward to going to \n  Paris? Sure. You know, was I excited about working in the fashion capital \n  of the world? Ooh, absolutely... Oh...! Yeah, but you know, this is... it's \n  fine. I'm fine going back to a job where I've pretty much gotten everything out of \n  that I possibly can... (she sits down, and Ross who is stunned to hear all this \n  follows her example)"
Ross	 Uhm, I hadn't no you... I had no idea you were so excited about Paris. \n  Uhm, I mean, you said you were scared."
Rachel	 Well yeah, but I mean, it was good scared though, you know? Like when \n  I-moved-to-New-York scared. Or uhm, when I-found-out-I-was-gonna-have-Emma scared... \n  But this is... fine. This is gonna be good. (they both stare around)'
Ross	 (after a long pause) You should go.'
Rachel	 What?'
Ross	 It's what you want. You should go."
Rachel	 You really think so?'
Ross	 I really do.'
Rachel	 But I already told Zelner that I would come back...'
Ross	 (picks up a skull of some carnivore from his side table and puts it in \n  the same bag in which he brought the pterodactyl egg to Zelner) I'm sure he'll \n  understand."
Rachel	 All right. ALL RIGHT! I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna go to Paris."
Ross	 Yeah...'
Rachel	 Yeah! I'm going to Paris. Thank you, Ross!"
Ross	 Yeah, yeah, oh! (They hug)'
Rachel	 Oh! Oh, I'm so happy."
Ross	 Then I'm happy too. (They're still hugging - fade out)"

Joey	 Thank you all for coming. We're here today to pay respects \n  to a wonderful agent and a beautiful woman... (Joey looks at the photograph) \n  ..inside. As Estelle's only two clients we would like to say a few words. (Joey \n  looks for his notes. The man next to him is chewing something.) Dude, where's \n  my speech? (the man swallows something and looks at Joey.) That is \n  entertaining. Al Zebooker everybody. (he applauds and Al shows that there's \n  nothing left in his mouth.)"
