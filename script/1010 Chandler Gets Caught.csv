\nMonica	 (really excited) Mmh... this cake is amazing!'
Rachel	 My God, get a room!'
Monica	 I would get a room with this cake. I think I could show this cake a good time!'
Phoebe	 If you had to, what would you give up, food or sex?'
Monica	 (with no hesitation) Sex!'
Chandler	 (looking at her) Seriously, answer faster!'
Monica	 Oh, I\'m sorry honey, you know, but when she said "sex" I wasn\'t thinking about "sex with you"!'
Chandler	 (to Phoebe) It's like a giant hug."
Phoebe	 Ross, how about you. What would you give up, sex or food?'
Ross	 Food.'
Phoebe	 Ok, how about... uhm... sex or dinosaurs?'
Ross	 Oh my God. It's like Sophie's Choice."
Rachel	 Oh God. What about you, Joe? What would you give up, sex or food?'
Joey	 Uhm... oh... I don't know, it's too hard."
Rachel	 No, you gotta pick one!'
Joey	 Oh... food. No, sex. Food! Sex! Food! Se-I don't know! Good God, I don't know, I want girls on bread!"

Rachel	 You gotta see these latest pictures of Emma.'
Phoebe	 Oh, how cute!'
Rachel	 Yeah.'
Phoebe	 Oh, she looks just like a little doll!'
Rachel	 Oh, no, no. That is a doll.'
Phoebe	 Oh, thank God, 'cause that thing's really creepy! (looking outside the window) Look, there's Chandler. (he's on the street, talking to a woman)"
Rachel	 Oh. Who is the blonde, she's pretty."
Phoebe	 OH! He's having an affair."
Rachel	 He's not having an affair!"
Phoebe	 You know, I'm always right about these things."
Rachel	 No, you're not! Last week you thought Ross was trying to kill you!"
Phoebe	 Well, I'm sorry but it's hard to believe that anyone would tell a story that dull just to tell it! (looking outside) See, there's something going on with them. Look, he's getting into the car with her!"
Rachel	 Oh, that doesn't mean anything."
Phoebe	 Oh yeah? Well, let's see. (she takes her mobile phone) Ok, duck down. (they both get down to hide themselves. Phoebe calls Chandler) "
Chandler	 (picking up the phone) Hello.'
Phoebe	 Oh, hi Chandler. It's Phoebe. Uhm... I know that Monica is working today so...(back to Central Perk) ...I was wondering if you want to come to the movies with me and Rachel."
Chandler	 Oh, uhm... I have to work too. Yeah, I'm stuck at the office all day."
Phoebe	 (shocked) Oh, well, it\'s a shame that you-that you miss the movie \'cause we were gonna see, you know, either "Liar, Liar" or "Betrayal", or... "An Affair To Remember".'
Chandler	 Those are all really old!'
Phoebe	 Ok, then maybe it'll be, uhm..."
Rachel	 (whispering) "Dude, Where\'s My Car?" '
Phoebe	 (glancing at her) What?'
Rachel	 They're in a caaar..."
Phoebe	 (to Chandler at the phone) Okay, we-we'll talk to you later. Okay, bye. "
Rachel	 Geez!'
Phoebe	 Ok. Quick. We gotta find a cab and follow them.'
Rachel	 Oh, yeah, ok. Let me just grab my night vision goggles and my stun gun.'
Phoebe	 (patting her bag) I got them!'
Chandler	 Hi!'
Monica	 Hey! You smell like perfume and cigarettes. '
Chandler	 I was in the car with Nancy all day.'
Monica	 Nancy doesn\xe2\x80\x99t smoke!'
Chandler	 Well, at least the perfume is not mine, be thankful for that!'
Monica	 So? What do you think of the house?'
Chandler	 It\xe2\x80\x99s perfect. It\xe2\x80\x99s everything we\xe2\x80\x99ve been looking for.'
Monica	 Isn\xe2\x80\x99t it? Then what about the amazing wainscotting and the crown molding and the dormer windows in the attic? '
Chandler	 And the wiggle wharms and the zip zorps? (pause) What were the things you said?'
Monica	 Don\xe2\x80\x99t you love the huge yard?'
Chandler	 And the fireplace in the bedroom.'
Monica	 And Nancy said that it's really under price, because the guy lost his job and has to move in with his parents!"
Chandler	 This is bringing out a lovely color in you!'
Monica	 So? Do you think we should get it?'
Chandler	 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. What do you think?'
Monica	 I think we should.'
Chandler	 I do too.'
Monica	 This is huge!'
Chandler	 I know.'
Monica	 How bad you wanna smoke, right now.'
Chandler	 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what you mean, giant talking cigarette! Oh, by the way, Phoebe called just as I was getting into Nancy\xe2\x80\x99s car, so if she asks you, I was at work all day.'
Monica	 Gotcha. When do we tell them about this?'
Chandler	 We don\xe2\x80\x99t. Not until it's a hundred percent. I mean, why upset everybody over nothing."
Monica	 Okay. Right. Oh my God that is gonna be so hard.'
Chandler	 I know. Gooooood luck with it.'
Ross	 I just can\xe2\x80\x99t see Chandler cheating!'
Rachel	 I\xe2\x80\x99m telling you guys, we followed them out to a house in Westchester, the went in for like forty-five minutes and then they came out looking pretty happy!'
Joey	 Chandler? Forty-five minutes? Well, something is not right. I just can\xe2\x80\x99t believe he would do this to Monica!'
Ross	 I know, and with the baby coming?'
Phoebe	 So, should we tell her?'
Ross	 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. Phoebe, if one of us saw Mike with another woman would you want us to tell you?'
Phoebe	 Why? Who\xe2\x80\x99d you seen him with?'
Ross	 No one, I\xe2\x80\x99m just saying if... (Phoebe starts pinching him in his neck)'
Phoebe	 TELL ME WHAT YOU KNOW!'
Ross	 (yelling in pain) I know nothing! Mike\xe2\x80\x99s a great guy, it was hypothetical!'
Phoebe	 All right. (she releases him). He is a good guy. You\xe2\x80\x99re right, he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t cheat.'
Ross	 Believe me, if I did see with someone, there\xe2\x80\x99s no way I... (Phoebe starts pinching him again)'
Phoebe 	 WHO DID YOU SEE HIM WITH?'
Rachel	 Oh, look at her, so happy!'
Monica	 If only there were a smaller one to clean this one!'
Joey	 Hey, is uhm... is Chandler here?'
Monica	 No, he\xe2\x80\x99s picking up dinner, why, what\xe2\x80\x99s up?'
Phoebe	 Well, look, whatever happens, we\xe2\x80\x99re here for you and we love you.'
Monica (puzzled)	 All right...'
Ross	 We think Chandler might be having an affair.'
Monica	 What?'
Rachel	 Phoebe and I saw Chandler with a blonde woman today outside on the street and then we followed them to a house in Westchester.'
Phoebe	 They went in together. So sorry.'
Monica	 Oh my God! Oh my God that\xe2\x80\x99s awful! What did you think of the house?'
Phoebe	 What?'
Joey	 (walking towards her to hold her and support her) Monica, you understand what we are saying, right?'
Monica	 Yeah, sure... uhm, I'm devastated, obviously... (to the rest) Did you think the neighborhood was homey? (Chandler enters)"
Chandler	 Hey!'
Joey	 (to Chandler) You son of a bitch!'
Chandler	 Is it me, or have the greetings gone downhill around here?'
Monica	 (goes to Chandler) Phoebe and Rachel saw you with Nancy today and... em... they think you're having an affair."
Rachel	 Who's Nancy?"
Ross	 What's going on?"
Monica	 (turns to them) Ok, alright, you guys, you'd better sit down, this is pretty big."
Chandler	 Yeah (motions them to sit and they do) I'm not having an affair. Nancy is our realtor."
Joey	 I knew he couldn't be with a woman for 45 minutes!!"
Phoebe	 Why do you have a realtor?'
Monica	 Uhm, she has been showing us houses outside of the city.'
Joey	 (clearly shocked) What?'
Rachel	 Are you serious?'
Monica	 When we found out that we're gonna get this baby, Chandler and I started talking and we decided that we didn't want to raise a kid in the city."
Phoebe	 So you're gonna move?"
Ross	 Oh my God.'
Joey	 Shouldn't we all vote on stuff like this?!"
Rachel	 What is wrong with raising a kid in the city? I'm doing it, Ross is doing it, Sarah Jessica Parker is doing it!"
Monica	 And that's great for you guys, but we want a lawn and a swingset..."
Chandler	 ...and a street where our kids can ride their bikes and maybe an ice-cream truck can go by.'
Ross	 (sarcastic) So you wanna buy a house in the 50's?"
Phoebe	 Have you thought about what you would be giving up? You can't move out of the city, what if you want Chinese food at 5am? Or a fake Rolex that breaks as soon as it rains or an Asian hooker sent right to your door?"
Ross	 You know what, if you wanna look for a house, that's okay."
Joey	 No, no, it's not, don't listen to him! (to Ross) I'm gonna thump you! (points his fist at him)"
Ross	 (to Joey) It's ok, because they have to get it out of their system, okay (back to Mon and Chan), but you're going to realize, this is the only place, you wanna be."
Chandler	 Actually, we already found a house we love.'
Ross	 What?'
Monica	 And about an hour ago, we made an offer.'
Chandler	 Bet you wish I was having an affair now, huh?'

Ross	 You put an offer on a house? '
Monica	 (smiling) It's so sweet. It really is. It has this big yard that leads down to this stream and then there's these old maple trees... (gets cut off)"
Phoebe	 Wha..? Again with the nature, what are you? Beavers?'
Chandler	 I know this is really hard and we're really sorry."
Joey	 Is this because I come over here without knocking and eat your food? (Walks towards the fridge) Because I can stop doing that, (looks at the fridge) I really, really think I can! '
Chandler	 (goes towards Joey) You know that's not the reason Joe. (Joey hugs him and after, he takes something from the fridge and puts it in his mouth. He goes back to where he was standing before)"
Monica	 We think if you saw it, you'd understand. I mean you guys were there. (Points to Rachel and Phoebe) It is beautiful, isn't it?"
Rachel	 Yeah it is.'
Joey	 What the hell are you doin'?"
Rachel	 Well, it is, all right? When we were out there today, all I kept thinking was
Phoebe	 Yeah, but so is this.'
Ross	 Yeah, I mean, if you moved there, you have to leave here. I mean, how can you leave this place?'
Rachel	 (talking on the phone) C'mon Daddy, listen to me! All of my life, everyone has always told me, 'You're a shoe! You're a shoe, you're a shoe, you're a shoe!'. And today I just stopped and I said, 'What if I don't wanna be a shoe? What if I wanna be a- a purse, y'know? Or a- or a hat! No, I don't want you to buy me a hat, I'm saying that I am a ha- It's a metaphor, Daddy!"
Ross	 You can see where he'd have trouble."
Rachel	 Well maybe I'll just stay here with Monica. "
Monica	 Well, I guess we've established who's staying here with Monica..."
Ross	 That money is mine, Green!'
Rachel	 You're fly is open, Geller!"
Phoebe	 You guys, you know what I just realized? 'Joker' is 'poker' with a 'J.' Coincidence?"
Chandler	 Hey, that's...'joincidence' with a 'C'!"
Phoebe	 [looking outside the window] Eww, look. Ugly Naked Guy lit a bunch of candles.'
Rachel	 Ow, that had to hurt!'
Phoebe	 Hey, it\xe2\x80\x99s your Thanksgiving too, y'know, instead of watching football, you could help."
The Guys	 We will. (they don\xe2\x80\x99t move)'
Monica	 Okay, Rachel, you wanna put the marshmallows in concentric circles.'
Rachel	 No Mon, you want to put them in concentric circles. I want to do this. '
Monica	 Every year.'
Joey	 (he has a turkey on his head) It's stuck!!!"
Phoebe	 (walks him to the kitchen) Easy. Step. How did it get on?'
Joey	 I put it on to scare Chandler!'
Phoebe	 Oh my God! Monica's gonna totally freak out!"
Joey	 It smells really bad in here.'
Phoebe	 Well, of course it smells really bad. You have your head inside a turkey's ass!"
Monica	 Hey, did you get the turkey bast-Oh my God! Oh my God! (She sees someone is stuck in the turkey.) Who is that?'
Joey	 It's Joey."
Monica	 I got it! How about, if we win, they have to get rid of the rooster?'
Rachel	 Oooohh that\xe2\x80\x99s interesting.'
Chandler	 If you win, we give up the birds.'
Joey	 (shocked) Dah!! (Chandler motions for him to calm down.)'
Chandler	 But if we win, we get your apartment.'
Joey	 Oooooh!'
Monica	 Deal!'

Ross	 What was Monica\xe2\x80\x99s nickname when she was a field hockey goalie?'
Joey	 Big fat goalie.'
Ross	 Correct. Rachel claims this is her favorite movie\xe2\x80\xa6'
Chandler	 Dangerous Liaisons.'
Ross	 Correct. Her actual favorite movie is...'
Joey	 Weekend at Bernie\xe2\x80\x99s.'
Ross	 Monica categorizes her towels. How many categories are there?'
Joey	 Everyday use.'
Chandler	 Fancy.'
Joey	 Guest.'
Chandler	 Fancy guest.'
Ross	 Two seconds...'
Joey	 Uhh, 11!'
Ross	 11, unbelievable, 11 is correct. (The guys celebrate.) '
Ross	 (to the girls) Chandler was how old when he first touched a girl\xe2\x80\x99s breast?'
Rachel	 14?'
Ross	 No, 19.'
Chandler	 Thanks man.'
Ross	 Joey had an imaginary childhood friend. His name was?'
Monica	 Maurice.'
Ross	 Correct, his profession was?'
Rachel	 Space cowboy!'
Ross	 Correct! What is Chandler Bing\xe2\x80\x99s job?'
Rachel	 Ow...Oh Gosh!'
Ross	 10 seconds, you need this or you lose the game.'
Monica	 It\xe2\x80\x99s umm, it has something to do with transponding.'
Rachel	 Oh-oh-oh, he\xe2\x80\x99s a transponce\xe2\x80\x94transpondster!'
Monica	 That\xe2\x80\x99s not even a word!'
Monica	 NOOOOOOOOO!!!!!'

Rachel	 Y\xe2\x80\x99know what, you are mean boys, who are just being mean!'
Joey	 Hey, don\xe2\x80\x99t get mad at us! No one forced you to raise the stakes!'
Rachel	 That is not true. She did! She forced me!'
Monica	 Hey, we would still be living here if hadn\xe2\x80\x99t gotten the question wrong!'
Rachel	 Well it stupid, unfair question!'
Ross	 Don\xe2\x80\x99t blame the questions!'
Chandler	 Would you all stop yelling in our apartment! You are ruining moving day for us!'
Ross	 Chandler!!! Chandler!!! (He opens the door to the apartment but is stopped by the chain; Chandler and Monica quickly stop making out and try to get dressed.) Chandler, I saw what you were doing through the window! Chandler, I saw what you were doing to my sister! Now get out here!'
Chandler	 (To Monica) Wow! Listen, we had a good run. You know, what was it? Four? Five months? I mean, that's more than most people have in a lifetime! So, good-bye, take care, bye-bye then! (He kisses her and starts to climb out the balcony window)"
Monica	 (She opens the door.) Hey Ross. What's up bro?"
Ross	 What the hell are doing?!!'
Rachel	 (running from the guy's apartment with Joey in tow) Hey, what's-what's going on?!"
Chandler	 Well, I think, I think Ross knows about me and Monica.'
Joey	 (panicking) Dude! He's right there!"
Ross	 (To Chandler) I thought you were my best friend, this is my sister! My best friend and my sister! I-I cannot believe this!'
Chandler	 Look, we're not just messing around! I love her. Okay, I'm in love with her."
Monica	 I'm so sorry that you had to find out this way. I'm sorry, but iit-t's true, I love him too."
Ross	 (happily) My best friend and my sister! I cannot believe this. (He hugs them both.) '
Monica	 Well, this is the last box of your clothes. I\xe2\x80\x99m just gonna label it, "What were you thinking?"'
Rachel	 Funny, because I was just gonna go across the hall and write that on Chandler.'
Phoebe	 Ok, you guys, I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to make things worse, but umm, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to live with Rachel anymore.'
Monica and Rachel	 What?!'
Phoebe	 You\xe2\x80\x99re just so mean to each other! And I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to end up like that with Rachel. I still like you!'
Rachel	 Well, Phoebe that\xe2\x80\x99s fine because I\xe2\x80\x99m not moving.'
Monica	 Whoa-whoa-whoa, Phoebe you gotta take her! Y\xe2\x80\x99know, I-I-I said some really bad stuff about her, but y\xe2\x80\x99know Rachel has some good qualities that make her a good roommate. She gets tons of catalogs and umm, she\xe2\x80\x99ll fold down the pages of the things she thinks that I\xe2\x80\x99d like.'
Phoebe	 What else?'
Monica	 When I take a shower, she leaves me little notes on the mirror.'
Rachel	 Yeah, I do. I-I do, do that.'
Phoebe	 That\xe2\x80\x99s nice. I like having things to read in the bathroom.'
Monica	 When I fall asleep on the couch after reading, she covers me over with a blanket.'
Rachel	 Well y\xe2\x80\x99know, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want you to be cold.'
Monica	 And when I told her that I was gonna be moving in with Chandler, she was really supportive. (To Rachel) (Starts to cry) You were so great. You made it so easy. And now you have to leave. And I have to live with a boy!! (They both break down in tears.)'

Chandler	 (entering) Hey.'
Monica	 She really left.'
Chandler	 I know. (He kisses her.)'
Monica	 Thank you.'
Chandler	 No problem roomie. (She turns around and hugs him.)'
Monica	 Can I ask you a question?'
Chandler	 Sure!'
Monica	 What the hell is that dog doing here?! (She notices the dog sitting in the living room.)'
Chandler	 Little toast here. I know this isn't exactly the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, I think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting. Anyway, I was just thinking, I mean, if you'd gone to Vail, and if you guys'd been with your family, if you didn't have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn't be all together, you know? So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked."
All	 That's so sweet."
Ross	 And hey, here's to a lousy Christmas."
Rachel	 And a crappy New Year.'
Chandler	 Here, here!'
Rachel	 You can't move. You just... you just can't."
Joey	 Rachel's right. This is where you guys belong. "
Phoebe	 Yeah, you don't wanna live in Westchester. That's like the worst of the Chesters."
Ross	 You know, sometimes when I'm alone in my apartment, I look over here and you guys... are just having dinner or... watching TV or something, but... it makes me feel better. And now when I look over, who am I gonna see? The Gottliebs, the Yangs? They don't make me feel so good. (Joey pats Ross on his back)"
Rachel	 Yeah. So don't move, okay? Just stay here and... (nods towards Ross) maybe close your blinds at night."
Chandler	 Hello? It's Nancy, they responded to our offer."
Monica	 And?'
Chandler	 (to Nancy) Okay, thanks... (to Monica) They passed. They said they wouldn't go a penny under the asking price."
Monica	 We can't afford that."
Chandler	 I know.'
Monica	 Well, there you go.'
Joey	 I'm really sorry you guys."
Ross	 Yeah. I'm sorry too. I'm even more sorry that that phone call didn't come before I told you about looking through the window."
Rachel	 Yeah, we're gonna let you be alone."
Phoebe	 (to Monica) You're gonna be okay?"
Monica	 Yeah, we'll be okay."
Ross	 Love you guys. (he kisses Monica, he, Rachel and Phoebe leave.)'
Joey	 You know, I'm really sorry I wasn't more supportive before."
Chandler	 That's okay, we understand."
Joey	 And about this Nancy thing... If you're not sleeping with her, should I?"
Monica	 I know there'll be other houses, but it's just so... I love that one so much."
Chandler	 Yeah... Well, it's a good thing we got it then."
Monica	 What?'
Chandler	 We got the house.'
Monica	 Oh my God!'
Chandler	 I just didn't want to tell you in front of them."
Monica	 Oh my God! My God! We've got the house !?"
Chandler	 We're getting the house. (they hug) We're getting the house."
Monica	 And a baby...'
Chandler	 We're growing up."
Monica	 We sure are.'
Chandler	 So who's gonna tell them?"
Monica	 (quickly) Not it!'
Chandler	 Not it! Damn it!'

Monica	 Rachel, this is yours.'
Rachel	 Aah! Why? What are these for?'
Chandler	 You'll see."
Monica	 All right, everybody open them!'
Rachel	 Ooh! Oh wow this is so beautiful. (she got a scarf)'
Phoebe	 Oh! These are the ones I was looking at in the store. (she got earrings)'
Monica	 I know.'
Ross	 I love this. (he got a sweater)'
Joey	 A meatball Sub? Thanks! (he got a meatball sandwich)'
Ross	 Seriously you guys, what's going on? What are these for?"
Chandler	 Well, I didn't know how to tell you before, but... We got the house."
Monica	 Enjoy!'
Joey	 (speaking with his mouth full, enjoying his sandwich) What did they say?'
