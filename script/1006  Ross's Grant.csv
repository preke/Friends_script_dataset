Phoebe	 (she enters) Hey...'
All	 Hey!'
Rachel	 Hi!'
Ross	 Pheebs, what's wrong?"
Phoebe	 Oh, I'm just so exhausted from dragging around this...\n   (she shows her ring) HUGE engagement ring!"
All	 OH!'
Rachel	 My God!'
Joey	 Hey!\n\nRachel
Ross	 So, did he get on one knee, did he have a speech prepared, \n  or (in a tender way) did he cry? (the guys look at him) Yeah, big surprise, \n  I like proposals!'
Phoebe	 Well, it was really sweet, and like the\n  most romantic thing ever.'
Joey	 Well, hey! Well... (he takes his mug to toast Phoebe) \n  Here's to Phoebe, who's found the greatest guy in the world! To Phoebe and... \n  (a bit uncertain) I wanna say Mike? (pause) To Phoebe and Mike!"
All	 Whoo!'
Phoebe	 Thank you! (to Rachel) Oh, and I have something for \n  you!'
Rachel	 Mmh-mmh!'
Phoebe	 It's, yes, my little black book. It's got the numbers \n  of all the guys I've dated."
Rachel	 Oh, Pheebs, baby, that's nice but, you know what, \n  I think I'm ok. Why don't you give it to one of your other single girlfriends? \n"
Phoebe	 I would, but you're the last one."
Rachel	 (angrily) GIVE ME THE BOOK! (she takes it and start \n  reading) Pablo Diaz, Brady Smith, huh, "Guy-in-van"?'
Phoebe	 Oh, my first love! '
Rachel	 Oh!'
Monica	 What does the red X next to Bob Greenmore's name mean?"
Phoebe	 Dead. (everyone is a bit upset) Oh, it's OK, no,\n  he  was old, yeah! And he lived a full life, he was in the first wave\n  at Omaha Beach."
Chandler	 Hey, I'm sorry, I should have given you guys my \n  black book when I got married! Although it wasn't so much a book as a... napkin. \n  With Janice's phone number on it."
Rachel	 Phoebe, isn't Jethro Tull a band?"
Phoebe	 (proud of herself) Oh yes, they are.'

Chandler	 (he enters) Hey honey!'
Joey	 (Looking inside the fridge, and we only see his back. \n  Then he closes the door, and we see it's Joey.) Hi sweetie!"
Chandler	 Is Monica not here?'
Joey	 No.'
Chandler	 Oh, then I'll tell you. My agency was bidding for\n  a big account and they got it! It's my first national commercial!"
Joey	 Cool!'
Chandler	 Yeah, and I don't wanna brag but a lot of the ideas\n   were mine! (silence) Hell, you weren't there? All the ideas were\n  mine!!!"
Joey	 That's great! Hey, can you cast me in it?"
Chandler	 Oh... I don't know, I really don't think you're \n  right for the part."
Joey	 What do you mean? I can do anything, I'm a chameleon! \n  Huh? (he mimes an old man with a beard) I'm old! (then he yawns) I'm tired! \n  (then he mimes someone who's hot...) Hey, I'm hot (...and cold) I'm cold!! Huh?? \n  Come on! What can't I do?"
Chandler	 First of all. Bravo. Uh, but I really don't think \n  you're right for this. The part calls for a stuffy college professor."
Joey	 I can do that! (in a deeper voice) "Hello, I\'m \n  your professor. When I\'m not busy thinking of important things or... professing. \n  I like to use..." Oh, what\'s the product?'
Chandler	 Software that facilitates inter-business networking \n  e-solutions?'
Joey	 (after a long pause he starts miming again) I'm cold!\n"
Ross	 (to Charlie) Hey!'
Charlie	 Hey!'
Ross	 Guess who's a finalist for a huge research\n  grant!  I'll give you a hint, he's looking right at you. "
Charlie	 Ah, well, unless it's the creepy guy with his hand \n  up his kilt, I'm gonna say congratulations! "
Ross	 Oh, I'm so excited, I mean, apparently I beat out hundreds\n   of other applicants, included five guys I went to graduate school with. Not\n  \n  that I'm keeping score or anything... five!"
Charlie	 Wow, that's great! So, tell me about the grant!"
Ross	 Well, ok, it\'s for 25 thousand dollars. And if I get\n   it, I\'ll finally be able to complete my field research! And there\n   will be  an article about me in the "Paleontology Review"! Yeah!\n   That\'ll be  the first time my name is in there, without people raising serious\n   questions \n  about my work!'
Charlie	 Wait. Are you talking about the Dewar grant?'
Ross	 Yeah. Why?'
Charlie	 Benjamin Hobart is administering that grant.'
Ross	 Your ex-boyfriend?'
Charlie	 Yeah.'
Ross	 So, your ex-boyfriend is gonna determine if your new \n  boyfriend gets this grant? Wow, your new boyfriend is screwed!'
Charlie	 No, no, we ended up in great terms. I mean, if anything, \n  I think this could help you. You know what? Why don't we all go out to dinner \n  together, and I can introduce you."
Ross	 Well, if you think it would help.'
Charlie	 Yes, absolutely. I'll call him."
Ross	 Ok, now, is there anything I can do to... you know, \n  butter him up? Anything he really likes?'
Charlie	 Mmh... he does have a pretty serious latex fetish.'
Ross	 We'll see how dinner goes."
Phoebe	 (looking at Monica entering) Hey! \n'
Monica	 Hey, you wanna go to see a movie?'
Phoebe	 Well, I told you I had to spend all the day clearing \n  out stuff, so Mike could move in.'
Monica	 Oh, right.'
Phoebe	 Yeah. '
Monica	 Oh, well. Now that I'm here I might as well help you \n  with the cleaning and organizing! Just happen to have my label maker!"
Phoebe	 Oh, it's so hard to get rid of stuff! Did\n  you and Chandler have to make compromises when you first moved in together?"
Monica	 Uh, Chandler did! What does he want you  to give  up?\n\nPhoebe
Monica	 Who's Gladys? (Phoebe shows her a horrific painting \n  with a half-a-body girl dummy coming out of the frame. Monica's frightened and \n  she gasps.) Oh! What a tragic loss!"
Phoebe	 Yeah. I really hate to give her up. Oh,\n  I know!! Oh, you should take her!'
Monica	 (faking happiness) Well, I-I-I-I... I don't know..."
Phoebe	 Why, you don't like her?"
Monica	 Well, of course I do. What's not to like! I'll \n  take her in a minute! But, you know, I think that you're giving up too \n  easy, honey. I think that you need to fight for her!"
Phoebe	 Really? You think?'
Monica	 Absolutely! Yes, you say to him "I\'m sorry \n  Mike I can\'t live without her, she means too much to me!"'
Phoebe	 Ok, I'll fight for her. Ok! Oh, wait, oh I just \n  realized... if I do that, that means you don't get her."
Monica	 Damn it, I did not think this through!\n'
Chandler	 Hey you guys. \n'
Rachel	 Hi!'
Joey	 Oh! Any word on casting yet?'
Chandler	 Joe, I told you, you're just not right for \n  the part."
Joey	 What do you mean? Rach, don't I seem like a professor \n  you'd buy some kind of e-crap from?"
Rachel	 I'm sorry, this sounds like something I'm never gonna \n  be interested in."
Joey (to Chandler)	 Look, c'mon, please? It's \n  not like I'm asking for some crazy favour. This is what I do for a living. I \n  am a professional actor! (he glances at his watch and sees the time) Oh, man, \n  I'm two hours late for work! (he stands, ready to go). Look, here's a \n  copy of my reels. It's got all the commercials that I've been in."
Chandler	 Joe...'
Joey	 Just watch it, and if you don't like it, you don't \n  pass it on to your bosses!"
Chandler	 Fine!'
Joey	 Thank you. (he sits down)'
Chandler	 Work, Joe!'
Joey	 Damn it! (he leaves)'
Chandler (to Rachel)	 What am I gonna do now?'
Joey	 Just pass it to your boss!'
Chandler	 He's not right for the part. So if I suggest \n  him, my bosses are gonna think I'm an idiot! And that's something they should \n  learn on their own!"
Rachel	 Just tell Joey that you watched the tape and you liked \n  it, but your bosses didn't. Then that way, you're the good guy and \n  they're the bad guys."
Chandler	 That's good! I liked it, they didn't. \n  (he sees Joey out of the window hitting on a girl) Joey, for God's sake, \n  go to work! (Joey runs away).\n"
\nRoss	 I can't believe I'm about to meet Benjamin Hobart. \n  I've always thought of him as one of the people I'd invite to my fantasy dinner \n  party. Do you think there's any chance he'll bring Christie Brinkley \n  or C3PO?"
Charlie	 (glances over Ross' shoulder) Sorry, looks \n  like it's just him."
Benjamin	 Charlie! My God, you look absolutely stunning!'
Ross	 Well, I... I am having a good hair day.'
Benjamin	 So good to see you.'
Charlie	 Me too. (she and Benjamin are hugging for very long \n  and Ross starts pretending to clear his throat, until they stop)'
Ross	 I'm ok."
Charlie	 I'm sorry... (introduces them to each other) Ross \n  Geller... Benjamin Hobart."
Ross	 It's an honor to meet you. I can't tell \n  you how long I've been an admirer of your work, I mean, that Nobel prize, \n  (he thumbs up) whoooo! I mean, I have to tell you that, you're one of \n  the reasons I got into the field."
Benjamin	 Oh, well, likewise. Actually, not likewise. I've \n  never heard of you until this morning, but, it's nice to be nice! "
Charlie	 Shall we? (they sit down and Benjamin takes Ross' \n  chair)."
Benjamin	 (to Ross) Thank you! (to Charlie). I can't\n   believe that you chose this restaurant! Do you remember the night?"
Charlie	 Oh my God, I completely forgot! (they laugh) Oh\n  my  God! I can't believe they let us back in this place! (they laugh\n  more, and Ross start laughing too)."
Benjamin (to Ross)	 You weren't there!"
Ross	 No, but, it's, you know, it's just a funny image, \n  you know, the two of you, in this restaurant, with... (laughs nervously)tzz-zzz, \n  mmm."
Charlie	 Ross, why don't you tell Benji about your proposal, \n  while I go to the ladies room?"
Benjamin	 So, tell me about it.'
Ross	 Ok well, I would like to do a dig in the painted desert.'
Benjamin	 M-m.'
Ross	 See, there are still several areas that haven't \n  been fully excavated."
Benjamin	 Break up with Charlie!'
Ross	 What?'
Benjamin	 What?'
Ross	 Did you just say "break up with Charlie"?'
Benjamin	 Well, yes, and now. Yes I did say it, and no, I \n  didn't not say it."
Ross	 Kind of inappropriate, don't you think?"
Benjamin	 I'm sorry. I just haven't seen her for so \n  long! All these feelings are rushing back! I'm starting to realize how much \n  I missed her, and I'm gonna need you to break up with her."
Ross	 Are you serious?'
Benjamin	 If you say yes then I'm serious, if you say no then \n  I'm joking!"
Ross	 No!'
Benjamin	 Joking it is!\n'
Phoebe	 Hi! Sorry, I'm late."
Monica	 Hey, how did it go with Mike, is he gonna let you \n  keep the painting?'
Phoebe	 No, he really hates it. But he's gonna let me \n  keep my box of human hair! So you got to pick your battles. But the good news \n  is, Gladys is yours!"
Monica	 Wow, what's the bad news!"
Rachel	 Who's Gladys?"
Phoebe	 Oh, she's that work of art I made, you know, \n  with the woman coming out of the frame."
Rachel	 (sarcastic) Oh, and Monica gets to keep her?\n  In her house? I am so jealous!'
Phoebe	 Oh, I didn't know you wanted her too!"
Monica	 Huh!'
Rachel	 Well, I mean, sure, of course. But... you already \n  gave that to Monica, so...'
Monica	 You know, I would give her up, for you.'
Rachel	 No, I couldn't let you do that."
Monica	 But I want to.'
Rachel	 But I don't want you to."
Monica	 But I insist!'
Rachel	 But I insist harder!'
Phoebe	 Girls, girls, stop, ok? We'll flip a coin. Heads, \n  she's Rachel's, tails she's Monica's. (she flips the \n  coin). Tails! Monica, she's yours!"
Monica	 No, that landed in your food!'
Rachel	 (sarcastic) No, no, that's ok. You won fair\n   and square. I'm so sad!\n"
Chandler	 Hey Joe!'
Joey	 What's up?"
Chandler	 Bad news. I watched the tape and passed it along \n  to my bosses and they weren't interested."
Joey	 (sounds disappointed) Oh.'
Chandler	 (Hands the tape back to him) I'm sorry man."
Joey	 (looks at him suspiciously) But, ehm... you watched \n  the tape?'
Chandler	 (sounds nervous) Yeah! I... I... I liked it! (Joey \n  continues to look at him suspiciously) But, ehm... my bosses didn't go for it. \n  Stupid sons of bitches!"
Joey	 (sounds confident) You didn't watch the tape."
Chandler	 (looks surprised) What!? Of course I did!'
Joey	 Look, it's one thing not to cast me, but to lie to me?"
Chandler	 I'm not lying to you, I watched it!"
Joey	 Well, you lied again! (Rachel comes out of her room \n  and is observing the conversation)'
Chandler	 I watched it!'
Joey	 Keep going Pinocchio!'
Chandler	 (now yelling) (pretending to look shocked) I did!'
Joey	 (yelling back) No you didn't! (turns and goes towards \n  his room)"
Chandler	 (following him) I'm telling you, I watched the tape. \n  (Reaches Joey's room and Joey slams the door in his face)"
Rachel	 Did you watch the tape?'
Chandler	(In a sarcastic "of course not"!-tone) \n  No!\n'
Benjamin	 The selection committee has chosen the three of \n  you as our finalists today. The ultimate decision will be based upon the answers \n  you give to the questions I ask here. I'm gonna start with Dr. Li. Dr. Li, you \n  claim the field is too reliant on the Linnaean taxonomic system. How do you \n  propose to correct this problem?"
Dr. Li	 Well, I believe that the answers lie in the osteological \n  evidence. I plan to begin there.'
Benjamin	 (nods) Interesting.'
Ross	 (Rolls his eyes) I guess!'
Benjamin	 Dr. Biely, your proposal includes some field work. \n  Where might that take place?'
Dr. Biely	 Primarily in the Pierre Shale region of South Dakota.'
Benjamin	 Certainly. Very well. And Dr. Geller, when is my \n  birthday?'
Ross	 (shocked and confused by the question) What? I... I... \n  (Benjamin looks at him as if to say "What\'s wrong? Answer the question")'
Benjamin	 Care to venture a guess?'
Ross	 (annoyed) May 12th?'
Benjamin	 (looks surprised and un-impressed) That's not even \n  kinda close! (Ross looks around confused) Dr. Li, how many graduate students \n  you'd be needing?"
Dr. Li	 Half a dozen.'
Benjamin	 I see, and Dr. Biely?'
Dr. Biely	 Three for excavation and two for analysis.'
Benjamin	 Certainly. Dr. Geller, which 1965 Shirelles hit \n  was later covered by a popular British invasion band?'
Ross	 (even more shocked) Wha..? I need 6 graduate students. \n'
Benjamin	 No! I\'m sorry, we were looking for "Baby It\'s \n  You". Baby It\'s You.'
Ross	 Wha...? Wait, wait, wait, just a minute. None of my \n  questions have anything to do with Paleontology.'
Benjamin	 You\'re right, I apologize. Scratch the last question. \n  Spell "Boscodictiasaur".'
Ross	 (annoyed) um... I\'ve never heard of a "Boscodictiasaur".'
Benjamin	 Yeah, I just made it up. Spell it.'
Ross	 (stares at him angrily) Ok. (determined to spell it \n  correctly) B - O - S ...'
Benjamin	 No, it starts with a silent "M".'
Ross	 Oh come on!!\n'
Chandler	 I can't believe Joey. I hate being called a liar!"
Rachel	 But you are a liar.'
Chandler	 What did I just say?'
Joey	 You still here?'
Chandler	 Yes, and I have to say, I am not just hurt. I am \n  insulted. When I tell somebody I did something...'
Joey	 Ok whoah-hey... Let me just stop you right there, ok? \n  First, you lied, right? Then, you lied about lying, ok? Then you lied about \n  lying about lying, ok? So before you lie about lying about lying about lying \n  about... lying... (loses count and begins to count the number of 'lyings' in \n  the air but gives up.) (yelling) Stop lying!"
Chandler	 Why are you so sure I didn't watch this tape?"
Joey	 (very angry) You wanna know wh...? You wanna know why? \n  (goes back into his room) '
Rachel	 Well, this is going well. (Chandler looks worried)'
Joey	 (comes out holding the tape) Here's how I know you didn't \n  watch the tape, ok? (puts it into the vcr) If you had seen what was on this \n  tape, believe me, you would have some comments. Alright, now remember, I \n  got paid a lot of money for this and it only aired in Japan. (presses play \n  and he appears on the TV screen and a TV commercial begins)"
\nJoey	 (Yelling at Chandler) And that's how I know you \n  didn't watch the tape! (goes back to his room and slams the door). "
Chandler	 He really is a chameleon.\n'
Phoebe	 (smiling from ear to ear) Well, Gladys say hello to \n  your new home! (she holds out the 'painting')"
Monica	 (faking happiness) Oh, my! '
Rachel	 (surprised by how ugly it is) Wow! (sarcastic) Oh, \n  she's so nice and big! Oh, Monica, where are you going to display Gladys oh \n  so proudly? (looks around for a spot)"
\nMonica	 (sounds desperate, knowing what Rachel is trying to \n  do) I haven't really settled on a spot yet!"
Rachel	 Well, hey! How about right above the TV? (Points to \n  the spot where her famous French poster is hanging). That way, it will be \n  the first thing that you see when you walk in the door!'
Phoebe	 (genuinely excited about it) Yeah, yeah! And you can \n  get rid of that French poster.'
Monica	 (offended) I like that poster!'
Phoebe	 Really? It doesn't have anything coming out of it. \n  Or maybe there is some place for her in your bedroom?"
Rachel	 (jumps at the chance to make that happen) Oh! There's \n  nothing above your bed!!"
Monica	 (Impatient with Rachel) Are you still here?'
\n\nRoss	 Oh hi! Hello! Uh, have you come to ask me some more paleontology \n  related questions? Uhm... your grandmother's nickname, perhaps? (Now yelling) \n  Aunt Margaret's pants size?"
Benjamin	 I've come here to apologize. I think I may have \n  let my feelings for Charlie interfere with the interview process. "
Ross	 (Sarcastic) No! Stop! '
Benjamin	 Anyway, I've decided to offer you the grant. "
Ross	 (Skeptical) Really?'
Benjamin	 Well... there is just one small... stipulation...'
Ross	 I have to break up with Charlie?'
Benjamin	 Hey, you got one right!'
Ross	 You're crazy."
Benjamin	 Crazy, or... romantic?'
Ross	 Crazy!'
Benjamin	 Ooor...'
Ross	 (Yelling) Get out! (Benjamin leaves)\n'
Rachel	 O-oh my God!'
Joey	 (enters from his bedroom) What?'
Rachel	 Joey, what... is... this...thing... doing here?'
Joey	 I got it from Monica. She sold it to me for a very \n  reasonable price.'
Rachel	 Joey, we're not keeping this!"
Joey	 But it's an original Buffay..."
Rachel	 Alright, fine. You can keep it. As long as you don't \n  mind that she's haunted. "
Joey	 Hey? what? what? wey! whoo! what? what!?'
Rachel	 Well, legend has it Joey, that... she comes alive \n  when you're asleep."
Rachel	 She climbs out of the frame, and then drags her half-a-body \n  across the floor, just looking for legs to steal. (in a spooky, slow voice) \n  And then with her one good hand, she slo-o-owly re-e-a-aches up and turns your \n  doorknob.'
Joey	 GET THAT LEGLESS WITCH OUT OF HERE!'
Monica	 Hey! I sold that to Joey.'
Rachel	 Well, why I told him it's haunted. Two can play at \n  this game. (gives Gladys to Monica)"
Monica	 No, too late. You can't give it back! (she pushes \n  the painting back to Rachel)"
Rachel	 Yes I can! (pushes her back again)'
Monica	 No you can't. She's yours!"
Rachel	 She's yours!"
Monica	 SHE'S YOURS!"
Rachel	 She's yours!"
Phoebe	 Hey! (there's a pause)"
Rachel	 She's mine!"
Monica	 She's m-i-i-ne!"
Rachel	 She's mine!"
Monica	 She's mine!"
Phoebe	 You guys! You guys! You don't have to fight over her \n  anymore. (she goes out into the hallway and enters with an even more hideous \n  painting/collage. One of those faceles mannequins heads wearing a blueish dress \n  and orange gloves reaching out into the room. Around the head 3 small dolls \n  are hovering.) Whoever doesn't get Gladys gets Glynnis. (Rachel and Monica are \n  gasping for air at the sight of this monstrous piece of art.)"
Rachel	 I want Gladys!'
Monica	 She's mine!"
Rachel	 She's mine!"
Monica	 She's mine!"
Rachel	 She's mine!"
Chandler	 Look, I'm sorry I didn't give them your tape. And \n  I promise, next time to submit you whether I think you are right for the part \n  or not."
Joey	 That's not the point Chandler. The point is that you \n  lied."
Chandler	 I know. You're right. What's it gonna take for you \n  to forgive me?\n"
Monica	 Oh my God!'
Rachel	 Excellent!'
Joey	 Now, what do you say?'
Chandler	 Lying is wrong!'
Joey	 And?... AND?'
Chandler	 I'm a pretty little girl."
Phoebe	 I knew it!\n'
Ross	 Your ex-boyfriend is insane.'
Charlie	 Did you get the grant?'
Ross	 No I didn't, and you want to know why? Because your \n  ex-boyfriend is still in love with you."
Charlie	 What?'
Ross	 Yeah. He wouldn't give me the grant, because I wouldn't \n  give you up."
Charlie	 Benji isn't in love with me. I mean, he broke up \n  with me. And besides, he's a very ethical man."
Ross	 Really? Is it ethical to ask someone in a grant review, \n  who was the voice of "Underdog"?'
Charlie	 I'm sure he was just joking, Ross."
Ross	 If you don't believe me, let's go talk to him, okay? \n  I'm telling you, he didn't ask me one paleontological question."
Charlie	 Seriously?'
Ross	 Oh, I'm sorry, no. He did ask me one. Uhm... How do \n  you spell Mboscodictiosaur?"
Charlie	 Well, if it's like the lake Mbosco in Congo, then \n  M-B-O... "
Ross	 Damnit!\n'
Benjamin	 Dr. Geller...? Charlie... What are you... what are \n  you doing here?'
Ross	 I want you to tell her everything. About the deal you \n  tried to make with me, about the crazy questions you... Wally Cox! That's the \n  voice of Underdog!"
Benjamin	 Like I tried to tell you in the interview Ross, \n  this grant is not based on your knowledge of pretty useless trivia.'
Ross	 No, no, no. Don't do that! I want you to look her in \n  the eyes, and tell her the truth."
Charlie	 Benji?'
Benjamin	 Alright, it's true. I behaved horribly. But it's \n  only because I still love you. And I would do anything to have you back in \n  my life."
Ross	 Too little, too late, Benji!'
Charlie	 I can't believe this."
Benjamin	 I never should have broken up with you. I think \n  about you all the time. I mean, do you ever still think about me? '
Ross	 (indignant) No!'
Charlie	 Yes!'
Ross	 What?'
Charlie	 I don't know what to say, Benji. This is all so.... \n  romantic."
Ross	 or...'
Benjamin	 Listen, I know, I may be way out of bounds here, \n  but is there any chance you will take me back?'
Charlie	 Maybe...'
Ross	 Sweetie, this conversation is starting to make me a \n  little uncomfortable.'
Charlie	 Oh God! I am so sorry, but... (she puts her hand \n  on Ross's cheek) I mean it's... there's so much history between us, you know..."
Benjamin	 (puts his hand on Ross's other cheek) I'm sorry \n  too..."
Benjamin	 I love you!'
Charlie	 I love you too! (and they start to kiss)'
Ross	 Okay, that's it. WE ARE SEEING OTHER PEOPLE!"

Joey	 Gladys?'
Rachel	 Ha ha ha, third time this week. Man, this does not \n  get old.'
Joey	 You're mean!"
Rachel	 Oh, don't be such a baby!"
