Ross	 Hey!'
Rachel	 Hey, so did everything go okay with the annulment?'
Ross	 Oh, yeah, no problems. It\xc2\x92s all taken care of.'
Rachel	 Ross, thank you. Hey, do you guys wanna go see a movie?'
Ross	 Oh yeah, why not?'
Rachel	 Okay, umm, I\xc2\x92m gonna get my sweater. (Walks away.)'
Ross	 Okay. (Sits down next to Phoebe.) You uh, you wanna hear something weird?'
Phoebe	 Always.'
Ross	 I didn\xc2\x92t get the annulment.'
Phoebe	 What?!'
Ross	 We\xc2\x92re still married! Don\xc2\x92t tell Rachel. See you later. (He gets\nup leaving Phoebe in shock.)'
Ross	 (To Rachel) Hey, do you have any gum?'
Rachel	 Oh? Yeah! Sure!'
Phoebe	 (running out) Wait! Wait! Hi! Listen, Ross can I just talk to you for\njust a second?'
Rachel	 Oh but Phoebe, we\xc2\x92re gonna be late for the movie.'
Phoebe	 Oh, there\xc2\x92s a cab! Taxi!! (The cab stops and she opens the door.)\nGood timing, my God, huh? Here you go. (Pushes Rachel in and closes the door.) '
Rachel	 Yeah, we\xc2\x92re, we\xc2\x92re actually just gonna walk \xc2\x91cause\nit\xc2\x92s right up there at the Angelica.'
Phoebe	 Oh, the Angelica!! Go! Go! (She bangs on the cab\xc2\x92s roof and it\npulls away.) (To Ross) You didn\xc2\x92t get the annulment?!!'
Ross	 I know.'
Phoebe	 Ross?!'
Ross	 Well, I tried! But when I got to my lawyer\xc2\x92s office all I could hear\nwas, "Three divorces. Three divorces!" Look, I just don\xc2\x92t want my tombstone\nto read, Ross Gellar, Three Divorces.'
Phoebe	 Don\xc2\x92t be worried about that! Your tombstone can say whatever you\nwant it to say! It could say, Ross Geller, Good at Marriage! Y\xc2\x92know? Mine\xc2\x92s\ngonna say Phoebe Buffay, Buried Alive.'
Ross	 Look, all I know is I-I can\xc2\x92t have another failed marriage!'
Phoebe	 So okay what? You\xc2\x92re gonna be married to a girl who doesn\xc2\x92t\neven know about it?!\xc2\x97Op, woman! Sorry.'
Ross	 Well, okay so, I don\xc2\x92t have it all worked out quite yet. Just\ndon\xc2\x92t say anything to Rachel, please?'
Phoebe	 Rachel is one of my closest friends. (Pause) Although, being the only\none who knows anything about this does makes me feel special. Okay!'
Rachel	 (to the driver) Okay, stop-stop! Phoebe?!'
Phoebe	 Hey Rach!'
Rachel	 What was that?!'
Phoebe	 Sorry, mix up. Hey, how was the movie?'
Rachel	 I haven\xc2\x92t seen it yet!'
Phoebe	 Well then you\xc2\x92d better hurry! The Angelica! Go! Go! (Bangs on the\nroof again and off they go.)'
Rachel	 Noooooooo!!'

Chandler	 Y\xc2\x92know when we move in together, can I get a gumball machine?'
Monica	 Of course! Joey wouldn\xc2\x92t let you have one?'
Chandler	 No. When it comes to sweets, he\xc2\x92s surprisingly strict.'
Monica	 Hey, have you figured out a way to tell him you\xc2\x92re moving out? '
Chandler	 No, no, I keep trying, y\xc2\x92know? I can get out, "Joey, I have\ntoo\xc2\x85" but then I lose my nerve and I always finish with, "\xc2\x85go to the\nbathroom." He may think I\xc2\x92m sick.'
Monica	 Y\xc2\x92know, I really have to tell Rachel, but I\xc2\x85 We just have to\nget it over with! Y\xc2\x92know, the next time we see them we\xc2\x92re just gonna tell them.\nOkay? That\xc2\x92s it.'
Chandler	 Oh, so that\xc2\x92s this is gonna work now? You\xc2\x92re just gonna\norder me around all the time?'
Monica	 Pretty much.'
Chandler	 All right.'
Joey	 (entering) Hey Monica!'
Monica	 Hi!'
Joey	 (To Chandler)\xc2\xa0Hey man, you feeling any better? (Chandler answers him\nwith some guttural sounds that only he can make and that no human can transcribe.)'
Monica	 Joey, we have something to tell you.'
Joey	 Oh my God! You\xc2\x92re pregnant!'
Chandler	 No-o-o! (To Monica) No? (She nods no.) No-o-o! Look Joey, here\xc2\x92s\nthe thing, Monica and I have decided to live together, here. So, I\xc2\x92m gonna be moving\nout man.'
Joey	 Wow! (Tearing up) Well, uh\xc2\x85 Hey! I\xc2\x92m really happy for you guys!\nCongratulations! (Kisses Monica on the cheek) See you later. (Starts for the door on the\nverge of tears as Monica stops him.)'
Monica	 Wait! Joey! Joey! Are you okay?!'
Joey	 Yeah, I gotta go! I got an acting job. (Turns towards the door, pauses,\nand turns back.) Like you\xc2\x92d believe that. This sucks!'
Chandler	 Look, I-I\xc2\x92m just gonna be right across the hall and I promise\nyou, the minute Monica and I break up I\xc2\x92m moving right back in with you!'
Joey	 (To Monica) Okay! Look-look-look, uh, if you\xc2\x92re gonna be moving in\nwith him I feel it\xc2\x92s my responsibility to tell you the truth about him! Okay?\nHe\xc2\x92s a terrible roommate! Terrible! He uh, forgets to umm\xc2\x85 Oh-oh he always, he\nalways umm\xc2\x97Oh, who am I kidding! He\xc2\x92s the best roommate ever! (Hugs Chandler.)'
Monica	 Hey Pheebs! '
Phoebe	 Hey!'
Monica	 Hey, have you seen Rachel?'
Phoebe	 No, why?'
Monica	 I have some pretty exciting news!'
Phoebe	 (gasps) You\xc2\x92re pregnant!'
Monica	 No! Chandler and I are moving in together!'
Phoebe	 Ooh! That\xc2\x92s good! Wow! But now if you were pregnant, what would you\nname it? Hint
Ross	 Hey! Hi!'
Monica	 Hey!'
Ross	 What\xc2\x92s up?'
Monica	 Well umm, Chandler and I are moving in together.'
Ross	 Oh my God. Ohh, my little sister and my best friend\xc2\x85shaking up. Oh,\nthat\xc2\x92s great. That\xc2\x92s great. (Kisses and hugs her.)'
Phoebe	 Guys, I\xc2\x92m happy too.'
Monica	 Okay, come here! (Phoebe joins them in the hug.)'
Phoebe	 Wow! Big day huh? People moving in, people getting annulled\xc2\x85 (Winks\nat Ross.)'
Monica	 Okay, I gotta go find Rachel but umm, if you guys see her could you\nplease try to give her some really bad news so that mine doesn\xc2\x92t seem so bad?\n(Exits.)'
Ross	 Bye.'
Phoebe	 Hmm, something bad to tell Rachel\xc2\x85 Bad news for Rachel, what could\nthat be?!'
Ross	 Could ya just, could ya just lay off, please? All right? My life is an\nembarrassment! I should go live under somebody\xc2\x92s stairs!'
Phoebe	 Ross, it\xc2\x92s not that big a deal! So you\xc2\x92ll been divorced three\ntimes, you\xc2\x92ll still have a life, you\xc2\x92ll go on dates\xc2\x85'
Ross	 (interrupting) No! No, I won\xc2\x92t! I\xc2\x92ll be at the bottom of the\ndating barrel now. The only guys below me will be Four Divorce Guy uh, Murderer Guy,\nand-and, Geologists.'
Phoebe	 Ross, you\xc2\x92re being ridiculous! Okay? You are cute and smart and\nsweet and that is much more important than three stupid divorces!'
Ross	 Oh yeah? Have you ever dated anyone who has been divorced three times?'
Phoebe	 Y\xc2\x92know that\xc2\x92s really fair. Y\xc2\x92know? Most guys who have\nbeen divorced three times are like 60. Ross, nobody cares about this except you! This-this\nembarrassment thing is all in your head! Here, I\xc2\x92ll show you! Come here.'
Ross	 What?! Why?'
Phoebe	 (to the girls) Hi! Hi! Listen, my friend Ross is about to be divorced\nfor the third time, but wouldn\xc2\x92t you date him?'
Ross	 And if you wait right here, I\xc2\x92ll go get Ross. (Phoebe grabs his arm\nand prevents him from escaping.)'
Chandler	 (entering) Hey!'
Monica	 Ugh, I thought you were Rachel!'
Chandler	 (looking down) What gave me away?'
Monica	 I just tell her, I have to get it over with. I told Ross and Phoebe and\nshe\xc2\x92s the only one left!'
Chandler	 Okay, so that\xc2\x92s it, everybody knows! It\xc2\x92s official,\nwe\xc2\x92re moving in together. No turning back. Are ya scared? Are ya?'
Monica	 No.'
Chandler	 Wow that was my scariest voice! You\xc2\x92re very brave.'
Rachel	 Hey!'
Chandler	 Hey.'
Rachel	 Ugh, the worse day! Y\xc2\x92know, you think you\xc2\x92re making progress\nat work and then your boss calls you Raquel.'
Chandler	 Hey listen, for the first four years of my work everybody called me\nSha-la-lap. (Awkward silence ensues.) Seriously.'
Rachel	 I believe you. So, it was right in the middle of a staff meeting so of\ncourse no one else wants to correct her so everyone else is calling me Raquel! By the end\nof the day, the mailroom guys were calling me Rocky!'
Chandler	 Well, I-I still think you\xc2\x92re very-very nice and very pretty\xc2\x85'
Rachel	 What?'
Chandler	 (To Monica) All yours babe. (Walks away.)'
Monica	 Have a seat. (They sit at the table.) Okay, listen umm, Chandler and I\nare going to live together, here.'
Rachel	 Oh my God! That\xc2\x92s so great! I\xc2\x92m so happy for you guys! '
Monica	 Really?!'
Rachel	 And that was so sweet of you to ask! Oh my God, the three of us are\ngonna have such a good time living together!'
Monica	 Yes, we are. (Chandler is frantically trying to get Monica to correct\nher.)'
Rachel	 And Chandler, you\xc2\x92re gonna have to watch those long showers you\ntake in the morning because you know Raquel can\xc2\x92t be late.'
Chandler	 Rach\xc2\x85'
Monica	 Yeah, he\xc2\x92s gonna work on that.'
Rachel	 Ohh! This is so exciting! Oh God\xc2\x85 (Gasps and starts to sing)\nCome and knock on my door\xc2\x85'
Monica	 (singing) We\xc2\x92ll be waiting for you\xc2\x85'

Ross	 \xc2\x85once you know the stories, it\xc2\x92s not that bad. First marriage,\nwife\xc2\x92s hidden sexuality, not my fault. Second marriage, said the wrong name at the\naltar, a little my fault. Third marriage, well they really shouldn\xc2\x92t allow you to get\nmarried when you\xc2\x92re that drunk and have writing all over your face, Nevada\xc2\x92s\nfault.'
Phoebe	 Okay, so what do you think ladies? Who wouldn\xc2\x92t be interested? Who\nwouldn\xc2\x92t want to date him?'
Stephanie	 Well the divorces don\xc2\x92t bother me, I\xc2\x92d date him. But, not\nwhile he\xc2\x92s still married.'
Phoebe	 Okay, what about you? (Points to Karin) Wouldn\xc2\x92t you want a date?'
Karin	 Actually, I\xc2\x92m dating at all anymore. See, I figured out that I was\nonly dating guys that were like y\xc2\x92know bad for me, so until I work that out\xc2\x85'
Phoebe	 (interrupting) Whatever! What about you Meg?'
Meg	 Well, I don\xc2\x92t care about the divorces either, but I wouldn\xc2\x92t date\nhim. It\xc2\x92s just that he\xc2\x92s obviously still in love with this Rachel girl.'
Ross	 What?!'
Phoebe	 (leaning to him) She said, "He\xc2\x92s obviously still in love with\nthis Rachel girl." (He glares at her.)'
Ross	 This is crazy! I mean, yes-yes Rachel is my good friend and I-I have loved\nher in the past, but now, she is just my wife! Phoebe, will you-will you help me\nout here?'
Phoebe	 Well, I thought you loved her when you-when you married her.'
Ross	 We were drunk! I would\xc2\x92ve married uh, Joey with that amount of\nalcohol!'
Phoebe	 Hey! You could do a lot worse than Joey Tribbiani!! '
Ross	 (to the panel) Look, I\xc2\x92m sorry, but you guys are wrong. I just\ndon\xc2\x92t want to be divorced three times.'
Phoebe	 Yes, and now he\xc2\x92s using this three divorces reason because he wants\nto stay married to her because he loves her. I must say, "Well done!" Bravo Meg.'
Ross	 (getting up) Okay! Fine! Fine! If-if this is what you think, forget about\nthe whole three divorce thing! Okay, I-I\xc2\x92ll go to my lawyer\xc2\x92s office right now\nand get this marriage annulled! Okay?! Because she means nothing to me! Noth\xc2\x97(leans\ndown to Meg\xc2\x92s ear)\xc2\x97Nothing!!'
Meg	 Okay now I wouldn\xc2\x92t date you because you seem a little creepy.'
Karin	 I am so attracted to him right now.'
Chandler	 Okay, when are we gonna tell Rachel what is actually gonna happen?'
Monica	 Soon! I-I just couldn\xc2\x92t before. You saw how upset Joey got! I\ncouldn\xc2\x92t do that to her, she\xc2\x92s my best friend!'
Chandler	 Well, Joey\xc2\x92s my best friend.'
Monica	 I\xc2\x92m not your best friend?'
Chandler	 You just said\xc2\x85 Of course you\xc2\x92re my best friend. Would you\nplease tell Rachel though?'
Monica	 All right, all right, at least I\xc2\x92m prepared.'
Chandler	 Okay. (She grabs a tin of freshly baked cookies) Oh yes. (He reaches\nfor one.)'
Monica	 (slapping his hand) Hey!'
Chandler	 Hey-hey!'
Monica	 These aren\xc2\x92t for you! Are you upset?'
Chandler	 I am now!'
Rachel	 (entering) Hey roomie!'
Chandler	 Okay, bye! (Exits.)'
Monica	 Rach, there\xc2\x92s something uh, important I have to tell you.'
Rachel	 (gasps) Are you pregnant?!'
Monica	 No! But, I\xc2\x92m throwing this shirt away! I think there was a little\nmisunderstanding before.'
Rachel	 Um-hmm.'
Monica	 Umm, when I said that uh, that Chandler and I wanted to umm, live\ntogether we meant alone together.'
Rachel	 (laughs) Oh my God! Oh, that\xc2\x92s funny, I can\xc2\x92t believe I did\nthat.'
Monica	 Oh no sweetie, no! This is my fault, I wasn\xc2\x92t clear! I\xc2\x92m\nreally sorry. And listen, you take as much time as you need to move out okay? There\xc2\x92s\nabsolutely no rush.'
Rachel	 Okay. (Sits back and resumes her reading.)'
Monica	 Okay. Don\xc2\x92t you want a cookie?'
Rachel	 Sure? (Monica hands her one.) Thanks.'
Monica	 Maybe, do you need a tissue?'
Rachel	 Monica, where did you get these?!'
Monica	 I made them!'
Rachel	 Ooh, good God, they\xc2\x92re so yummy! (She re-ingests the previously\nexpelled cookie matter from the tissue.)'
Joey	 God, it\xc2\x92s gonna so weird like when I come home and you\xc2\x92re not\nhere. Y\xc2\x92know? No more Joey and Chan\xc2\x92s. No more J and C\xc2\x92s. "You wanna\ngo over to Joey and Chandler\xc2\x92s?" "Can\xc2\x92t, its not there."'
Chandler	 Look, I\xc2\x92m just gonna be across the hall, we can still do all the\nsame stuff.'
Joey	 Yeah but we won\xc2\x92t be able to like get up in the middle of the night\nand have those long talks about our feelings and the future.'
Chandler	 Not once did we do that.'
Monica	 (entering) Hi.'
Chandler	 Hey!'
Joey	 Hi.'
Monica	 So I, I told Rachel it was just gonna be the two of us.'
Chandler	 Oh yeah? Well, how\xc2\x92d she take it?'
Monica	 Really well. Yeah. Surprisingly well. Yeah, she didn\xc2\x92t cry. She\nwasn\xc2\x92t angry or sad. (Sits down, slightly disgusted.)'
Chandler	 And you\xc2\x92re upset because you didn\xc2\x92t make your best friend\ncry?'
Monica	 I mean, all I\xc2\x92m asking for is just a little emotion! Is that too\nmuch to ask after six years?! I mean what? Are-are-are Rachel and I not as close as you\nguys?! I mean do we not have as much fun?! Don\xc2\x92t I deserve a few tears?!! I mean\nwe-we told Joey, he cried his eyes out!'
Joey	 Hey! I did not cry my eyes out!! Come on! It\xc2\x92s like the end of an\nera! No more J-man and Channie\xc2\x92s!! '
Chandler	 Okay, I gotta ask, who calls us that?!'
Russell	 You got married again.'
Ross	 Yes.'
Russell	 So that\xc2\x92s your second marriage in two years.'
Ross	 Yes, second in two years. Third overall.'
Russell	 Ross, I have been a divorce attorney for 23 years and never had I so\nmuch business from one client. Why don\xc2\x92t you tell me what happened.'
Ross	 Basically, Rachel and I were in Vegas and we got drunk\xc2\x85'
Russell	 (interrupting) I\xc2\x92m sorry, is this the same Rachel who\xc2\x92s name\nyou said at the altar in the second marriage?'
Ross	 Yes-yes-yes! But, I-I do not love her.'
Russell	 Oh, that\xc2\x92s better then.'
Ross	 This was just a drunken mistake and I need to get it annulled.'
Russell	 I see. Have you considered therapy?'
Ross	 I think just the annulment for today.'
Russell	 There are a couple of forms to fill out.'
Ross	 Easy.'
Russell	 And we\xc2\x92ll need to have witnesses who can testify that you were not\nof uh, sound mind.'
Ross	 No problem.'
Russell	 And we\xc2\x92ll need you and Rachel to testify before a judge.'
Ross	 Ooh! There\xc2\x92s no way to do this without her? \xc2\x91Cause I kinda all\nready told her uh, it was, it was already taken care of.'
Russell	 Of course you did. Look Ross, you can\xc2\x92t get an annulment unless\nyou and Rachel are both there.'
Ross	 Uh-ha, what about someone who looks like Rachel? (Russell glares at him.)\nI will think about the therapy.'
Rachel	 Hey!'
Monica	 Hey. So um, I was thinking that maybe we should start dividing up our\nstuff.'
Rachel	 Okay!'
Monica	 Y\xc2\x92know, no point in dragging it out. Dragging out the long\nprocess of you moving out and us not living together anymore.'
Rachel	 Okay.'
Monica	 Hey Rach, what about this? (She holds up a chrome 5-point star.) Huh?\nWho-who gets this? See, I don\xc2\x92t know if I want it because it might be y\xc2\x92know,\ntoo many memories!'
Rachel	 (grabbing the star) What the hell is that?'
Monica	 I don\xc2\x92t know. (Picks up a big plate from the coffee table.) Hey,\nRachel, you want the big plate? I want you to have the big plate.'
Rachel	 Wow! Mon, thanks! I love this plate!'
Monica	 Something to remember me by!'
Rachel	 Mon, honey you\xc2\x92re not dying. I\xc2\x92m just moving out. Y\xc2\x92know,\nI mean we\xc2\x92re gonna see each other all the time.'
Monica	 But still, it\xc2\x92s a big change. The end of an era, you might say!'
Rachel	 Are you okay? You\xc2\x92re not blinking.'
Monica	 I\xc2\x92m fine! I just, I\xc2\x92m thinking how much it\xc2\x92s an end of\nera.'
Rachel	 Oh, all right. But y\xc2\x92know I gotta say, I don\xc2\x92t, I don\xc2\x92t\nthink six years counts as an era.'
Monica	 An era is defined as a significant period of time. Now, it was\nsignificant to me, maybe it wasn\xc2\x92t significant to you!'
Rachel	 What is the matter with you?!'
Monica	 What is the matter with you?!! Why aren\xc2\x92t you more upset?!\nAren\xc2\x92t you gonna be sad that we\xc2\x92re not gonna be living together anymore?! I mean\naren\xc2\x92t you gonna miss me at all?!'
Rachel	 All right, fine, but don\xc2\x92t get mad at me. It\xc2\x92s-it\xc2\x92s just\na little hard to believe.'
Monica	 What\xc2\x92s hard to believe?'
Rachel	 Well y\xc2\x92know, it\xc2\x92s you guys. You-you do this kind of stuff!\nY\xc2\x92know? I mean, you-you were gonna get married in Vegas and then you backed out! I\nguess I\xc2\x92m not upset because I don\xc2\x92t see you guys going through with it. I\xc2\x92m\nsorry.'
Monica	 Rachel, it\xc2\x92s going to happen. Chandler is gonna move in here.'
Rachel	 But I\xc2\x85'
Monica	 No-no, wait! Just let me finish, okay? This isn\xc2\x92t something that we\njust, we just impulsively decided in-in Vegas, this is something we both really want. And\nit is going to happen.'
Rachel	 It is? Really?'
Monica	 Yeah, sweetie.'
Rachel	 (starting to lose her composure) I mean we\xc2\x92re not, we\xc2\x92re not\ngonna live together anymore?'
Monica	 No.'
Rachel	 What? Oh my God! I\xc2\x92m gonna miss you so much! (Starts to cry.)'
Monica	 I\xc2\x92m gonna miss you! (They hug.)'
Rachel	 I mean it\xc2\x92s the end of an era!'
Monica	 I know!'
Phoebe	 (to Joey and Chandler) Okay, bye!'
Ross	 Oh no.'
Phoebe	 So? Did you get the annulment?'
Ross	 I couldn\xc2\x92t.'
Phoebe	 I knew it! Because you love Rachel.'
Ross	 It\xc2\x92s not that. Okay? Annulments are more complicated than I\xc2\x85'
Phoebe	 Yeah, complicated \xc2\x91cause of the love.'
Ross	 I\xc2\x85 I do, I do not love Rachel. I\xc2\x92m gonna tell her right now\nabout the whole thing so we can get this marriage annulled as fast as possible. Okay?\nWould I do that if I loved her?'
Phoebe	 I\xc2\x92ve never been more convinced of your love for her.'
Ross	 I do not have feelings for Rachel! Okay?! (He goes into her apartment.)'
Ross	 Ohh, what\xc2\x92s wrong?!'
Rachel	 Monica and Chandler are really moving in here and I have to move out and\neverything is changing.'
Ross	 Oh my\xc2\x97Come here! Come here! (He hugs her.) It\xc2\x92s okay.\nEverything\xc2\x92s gonna be okay.'
Rachel	 Thank you.'
Ross	 Of course.'

Joey	 So, Ross and Rachel got married, Monica and Chandler almost got married,\ndo you think you and I should hook up?'
Phoebe	 Oh we do, but not just yet.'
Joey	 Really?! Well, when?'
Phoebe	 Okay umm, well, first Chandler and Monica will get married and be filthy\nrich by the way. Yeah. But it won\xc2\x92t work out.'
Joey	 Wow.'
Phoebe	 I know. Then, I\xc2\x92m gonna marry Chandler for the money and\nyou\xc2\x92ll marry Rachel and have the beautiful kids.'
Joey	 Great!'
Phoebe	 But then we ditch those two and that\xc2\x92s when we get married.\nWe\xc2\x92ll have Chandler\xc2\x92s money and Rachel\xc2\x92s kids and getting custody will be\neasy because of Rachel\xc2\x92s drinking problem.'
Joey	 Oh-oh, what about Ross?'
Phoebe	 I don\xc2\x92t want to go into the whole thing, but umm, we have words and\nI kill him.'
