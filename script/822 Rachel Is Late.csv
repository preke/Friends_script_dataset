Ross	 Hey! What are you guys looking at?'
Joey	 Oh, it\xc2\x92s a poster for that World War I movie that I\xc2\x92m in, check\nit out.'
Ross	 Yeah? Wow! It looks really violent!'
Joey	 Uh-huh! I know. I\xc2\x92m coming soon to a theater near you! I\xc2\x92m in\nTHX! I\xc2\x92m unsuitable for children!'
Ross	 Now I cannot wait to see this.'
Joey	 Yeah, yeah, it\xc2\x92s already generating Oscar buzz.'
Phoebe	 I started that!'
Joey	 I thought I did! Oh hey guess what? The premiere is next week and\nyou\xc2\x92re all invited! (They all gasp.)'
Monica	 Are we gonna take a limo?'
Joey	 Sure! Why not?!'
Monica	 Oh I love taking limos when nobody died!'
Rachel	 Well obviously I won\xc2\x92t be able to come, for those of you who\nhaven\xc2\x92t checked their calendars today is my due date. Well y\xc2\x92know, I just want\nto take a moment and thank you guys for how great you\xc2\x92ve been during this time. I\nreally couldn\xc2\x92t have done it without you. And I have loved these last nine\nmonths! And even though I am so looking forward to the next part, I am really gonna miss\nbeing pregnant.'
Rachel	 That\xc2\x92s right, still no baby! (To Monica, Joey, and Chandler on the\ncouch) Come on people! Please make some room!'
Ross	 Uh sweetie, maybe you\xc2\x92d be more comfortable here? (Gets up from the\ngreen armchair.)'
Rachel	 You. Like you haven\xc2\x92t done enough.'
Ross	 Look, I-I know how miserable you are, I wish there was something I can do.\nI mean I wish I were a seahorse. (She glares at him) Because with seahorses it\xc2\x92s the\nmale, they carry the babies. And then also umm, I\xc2\x92d be far away in the sea. (He sits\nback down.)'
Rachel	 God. (Sits down.) I have never been so uncomfortable in my entire life!'
Phoebe	 Oh I know, I\xc2\x92ve been there. I remember toward the end\xc2\x85'
Rachel	 (interrupting her) Oh Phoebe, that\xc2\x92s a great story. Can you tell it\nto me when you\xc2\x92re getting me some iced tea? (Phoebe gets up and Rachel groans.) (To\nthe baby) Oh God, get out! Get out!! Get out!! Get out!!'
Chandler	 Let\xc2\x92s. (Everyone gets up and leaves Rachel.)'

Chandler	 Hey! Did you have the baby yet?'
Rachel	 Do you want me to come over there and sit on you? \xc2\x91Cause I\xc2\x92ll\ndo it.'
Monica	 What are you doing here so early?'
Rachel	 They sent me home from work. They were like, "Start your maternity\nleave now! Just rest, get ready for the baby." Well y\xc2\x92know what? Screw \xc2\x91em!\nIf they don\xc2\x92t want me there, I\xc2\x92ll just hang out with you guys.'
Phoebe	 Or you can do volunteer work.'
Joey	 Hello?'
Estelle	 Joey! It\xc2\x92s Estelle! Great news, I was able to get you and one\nguest tickets to your premiere.'
Joey	 One guest? You told me I can have six tickets!'
Estelle	 Well, I sold four of them on Ebay. You\xc2\x92ll be sitting next\nto HotGuy372.'
Joey	 Oh my God. So that\xc2\x92s it?! I only get to bring one guest?'
Estelle	 Yeah, what time do you wanna pick me up? (Joey hangs up on her.) Hello?'
Joey	 (to Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe) Did you hear that? I only get one extra\nticket to my premiere. So some how I have to pick between you three and Ross.'
Rachel	 (overhearing that) What-what about me?'
Joey	 You said you didn\xc2\x92t want to go.'
Rachel	 I don\xc2\x92t. But I would still like to be acknowledged. What? Just\nbecause I\xc2\x92m pregnant you think I\xc2\x92m invisible.'
Joey	 Definitely not invisible.'
Monica	 Well, well Ross didn\xc2\x92t care enough to be here, so I think he\xc2\x92s\nout. You snooze you lose.'
Chandler	 He\xc2\x92s not snoozing, he\xc2\x92s teaching a class.'
Monica	 Well then somebody\xc2\x92s snoozing. Joey, not that this uh should affect\nyou at all, but if you were to pick me, I was planning on wearing a sequined dress, cut\ndown to here. (Points to her stomach just above her belly button.)'
Chandler	 I haven\xc2\x92t seen this dress.'
Monica	 Star in a movie.'
Phoebe	 Joey, you pick who ever you want. Okay? You just listen to your heart.\nWhat does it tell you? (Mimicking a heartbeat and tapping her chest.) Phoebe, Phoebe.'
Joey	 Well uh\xc2\x85I think I want to take Chandler.'
Phoebe	 (still mimicking a heartbeat, only faster)\nPhoebe-Phoebe-Phoebe-Phoebe\xc2\x97Burrrrr! (Mimics the sound of a cardiac monitor going\noff.)'
Chandler	 You really want to take me?'
Joey	 Yeah! Yeah! I mean I\xc2\x92m sorry, I wish I can take everybody, but\ny\xc2\x92know Chandler always supported my career. He\xc2\x92s paid for acting classes and\nhead shots and stuff and well this will be my way of paying you back.'
Chandler	 So you\xc2\x92re never actually going to pay me back?'
Monica	 Wait a minute, just because he paid for your head shots you\xc2\x92re\ngonna take him? Joey, I don\xc2\x92t think you\xc2\x92re comprehending just how slutty this\ndress is!'
Joey	 It\xc2\x92s not just the stuff he paid for, I mean it\xc2\x92s-it\xc2\x92s\neverything. Y\xc2\x92know? He read lines with me. He-he went with me on auditions when I was\nreally nervous, and then he consoled me after I didn\xc2\x92t get parts that I really\nwanted. You always believed in me man. Even, even when I didn\xc2\x92t believe in myself.'
Chandler	 I always knew you were gonna make it. I\xc2\x92m so proud of you.'
Joey	 Thanks. That means a lot to me.'
Phoebe	 Mon, maybe one of these guys wants to wear your dress.'
Joey	 (in a manly voice) I\xc2\x92m gonna go shave. (Gets up.)'
Chandler	 (in a manly voice) Yeah well, I\xc2\x92m gonna go spit. (He goes into\nthe bedroom. On his way out, Joey gives Rachel a wide berth.)'
Rachel	 Oh, I have to pee. If I don\xc2\x92t come out in five minutes it\xc2\x92s\nbecause I\xc2\x92ve choked to death on the potpourri stink. (Goes into the bathroom.)'
Phoebe	 When she comes out, you hold her nose, I\xc2\x92ll blow in her mouth, and\nthe kid will just (makes a popping sound) right out of her.'
Monica	 She\xc2\x92s over a week late! She gotta have it today, right?'
Phoebe	 I don\xc2\x92t know. I-I think it\xc2\x92s still gonna be a while.'
Monica	 Hmm, care to make it interesting? I\xc2\x92ll bet you that she\xc2\x92ll\nhave it by this time tomorrow.'
Phoebe	 You\xc2\x92re on!'
Monica	 Okay, how much?'
Phoebe	 One hundred thousand dollars!'
Monica	 How about fifty bucks?'
Phoebe	 Fine! I\xc2\x92ll call Zurich and move some money around.'
Rachel	 (calling from the bathroom) All right, who\xc2\x92s turn is it to help me\nget up!'
Phoebe	 No one\xc2\x92s here! (Monica looks at her.) Oh damnit!'
Chandler	 This is so exciting! It\xc2\x92s so glamorous! People taking our\npicture. How do I look?'
Joey	 A little tall.'
Chandler	 What?'
Joey	 Do you mind crouching down a little bit, so that I look taller? (Chandler\ndoes so) There you go. (And they walk down the red carpet.)'
Chandler	 It\xc2\x92s just so glamorous.'
Phoebe	 Oh hey Mon? Rach is here! Ohh, you\xc2\x92re still pregnant. Oh, I\xc2\x92m\nsorry. I know how uncomfortable you are. Y\xc2\x92know what? You look great. Yeah, like\nfifty bucks.'
Rachel	 Oh, I have to go pee. Apparently this baby thinks that my bladder is a\nsqueeze toy. (Goes to the bathroom.)'
Monica	 Damnit! Damnit!! Here\xc2\x92s your fifty bucks! (Pays Phoebe.)'
Phoebe	 It\xc2\x92s interesting that you lost. Now, I forget, do you like to lose?'
Monica	 Now stop it! Double or nothing that she has it by tomorrow!'
Phoebe	 Fine! You\xc2\x92re on!'
Monica	 Okay.'
Phoebe	 Until then, General Grant, why don\xc2\x92t you set up camp (She puts the\nbill in her bra) right there.'
Ross	 (entering) Hey is Rachel here? We have a doctor\xc2\x92s appointment.'
Monica	 She\xc2\x92s in the bathroom.'
Ross	 Rach, we gotta go.'
Rachel	 In a minute!!!'
Ross	 People ask me why we\xc2\x92re not together, I just don\xc2\x92t know what to\ntell them.'
Rachel	 (entering) All right, all right. Let\xc2\x92s go!'
Ross	 Uh, do you wanna go change first? The doctor\xc2\x92s keeping the office\nopen late for us, but if you hurry\xc2\x85'
Rachel	 No, I\xc2\x92m fine.'
Ross	 Really? You don\xc2\x92t think that\xc2\x92s a little inappropriate.\n(She\xc2\x92s wearing a tank top and has her belly sticking out.)'
Phoebe	 Good God man don\xc2\x92t anger it.'
Rachel	 Ross, it is 100 degrees outside. For the first time in weeks, I am\nsomewhat comfortable.'
Ross	 Fine! Fine! Y\xc2\x92know what? Whatever you want. Okay? You\xc2\x92re the\nmommy.'
Rachel	 Oh uh-uh pal! Don\xc2\x92t call me mommy! It\xc2\x92s bad enough you call\nyour own mother that. (He looks at Monica.)'
Monica	 I\xc2\x92m actually with her on this one.'
Joey	 (onscreen) "I thought I knew who the enemy was, but it was you all\nalong." '
Joey	 (To Chandler) Okay, this is it. It\xc2\x92s my big fight scene coming up.\n(He looks over and Chandler and notices that he\xc2\x92s asleep.)'
Rachel	 Ross.'
Ross	 Yeah?'
Rachel	 Can I ask you something?'
Ross	 Uh-huh.'
Rachel	 When Carol was pregnant with Ben\xc2\x85'
Ross	 Mmm?'
Rachel	 \xc2\x85were you this irritating?'
Ross	 Wow!'
Rachel	 Excuse me?!'
Ross	 Oh nothing. Nothing! Just uh, you\xc2\x92ve been a little short with me\nlately. I\xc2\x92m not trying to irritate you.'
Rachel	 Well then you just must have a natural talent for it.'
Ross	 Y\xc2\x92know what? The doctor will be in soon, why don\xc2\x92t we not speak\nuntil then.'
Rachel	 (silently) Okay. (Pause) Seriously, breathe louder Ross! That\xc2\x92s\ngreat!'
Ross	 Y\xc2\x92know we should probably ask the doctor if she even knows how to\ndeliver a baby that\xc2\x92s half human and half pure evil!'
Rachel	 Hi Dr. Long, how are you?'
Ross	 (to Rachel) Oh, you\xc2\x92re nice to her.'
Rachel	 She has the drugs!'
Dr. Long	 We\xc2\x92ll do a quick check.'
Rachel	 Okay. (Rachel lies back.)'
Dr. Long	 So, eight days late huh?'
Rachel	 Yeah.'
Dr. Long	 You must be a little uncomfortable.'
Rachel	 Eh, just a tad.'
Dr. Long	 You\xc2\x92re about 80 percent effaced, so you\xc2\x92re on your way. It\nstill could last a little while longer. If you\xc2\x92re anxious there are a few ways to\nhelp things along.'
Ross	 Do them!!'
Dr. Long	 Actually, they\xc2\x92re things you can do. Just some home remedies, but\nin my experience I\xc2\x92ve found that some of them are quite effective.'
Rachel	 Well, we are ready to try anything.'
Dr. Long	 Okay, there\xc2\x92s an herbal tea you can drink.'
Rachel	 Okay.'
Dr. Long	 You can take some caster oil, there\xc2\x92s eating spicy foods\xc2\x85'
Rachel	 Great! We will do all of those.'
Dr. Long	 \xc2\x85taking a long walk, and then there\xc2\x92s the one that\xc2\x92s\nproved most effective
Ross	 You\xc2\x92ve got to be kidding me!'

Chandler	 Good job Joe! Well done! Top notch!'
Joey	 You liked it? You really liked it?'
Chandler	 Oh-ho-ho, yeah!'
Joey	 Which part exactly?'
Chandler	 The whole thing! Can we go?'
Joey	 Oh no-no-no, give me some specifics.'
Chandler	 I love the specifics, the specifics were the best part!'
Joey	 Hey, what about the scene with the kangaroo? Did-did you like that part?'
Chandler	 I was surprised to see a kangaroo in a World War I epic.'
Joey	 You fell asleep!! There was no kangaroo! They didn\xc2\x92t take any of my\nsuggestions! That\xc2\x92s for coming buddy. I\xc2\x92ll see you later. (Starts to walk out.)'
Chandler	 Don\xc2\x92t go! I\xc2\x92m sorry. I\xc2\x92m so sorry! (Sees another guy\nwho is still asleep.) Look! This guy fell asleep! He fell asleep too! Be mad at him!\n(Looks at him more closely.) Or, call an ambulance.'
Monica	 Hey!'
Ross	 Hey.'
Rachel	 Hi!'
Monica	 What did the doctor say? Any news on when the baby will come?'
Rachel	 No. But she did give us some ideas on how to induce labor.'
Ross	 Yeah, we tried them all. We went for a walk, uh we tried a special tea,\ncaster oil, spicy food nothing has worked.'
Rachel	 Well, there is one thing that we haven\xc2\x92t tried, but someone thinks\nthat, (mimicking Ross) "That will open up a can of worms."'
Monica	 Well what is it? What is it? If it\xc2\x92s gonna help bring the baby\nhere, like today. I mean, I think you should do it.'
Ross	 It\xc2\x92s sex.'
Monica	 Do it!'
Ross	 Monica!'
Monica	 I\xc2\x92m just saying it\xc2\x92s been a really long time for you. I mean,\nwomen have needs. Do it, get yours!'
Phoebe	 Oh I-I don\xc2\x92t know about that. No, I think that if the two of you\nhad sex the-the-the repercussions would be catastrophic. '
Monica	 All right, let\xc2\x92s be practical, if Ross isn\xc2\x92t willing to do it,\nhe\xc2\x92s not the only guy in the world you can have sex with. You can borrow\nChandler\xc2\x97Chandler is good!'
Ross	 Monica, what is the matter with you?'
Monica	 Nothing. I just want the baby to be born today.'
Rachel	 Why? Why today?'
Monica	 Okay fine! I keep betting Phoebe that you\xc2\x92re gonna have the baby\nand I don\xc2\x92t want to lose again!'
Ross	 What?! While she\xc2\x92s been going through this hell, you\xc2\x92ve been\nmaking money?! You\xc2\x92re betting on your friend staying in this misery?! (Phoebe lowers\nher head and shakes it yes.)'
Rachel	 I\xc2\x92ll take that bet.'
Ross	 What?!'
Rachel	 Well, I\xc2\x92m miserable here! I might as well make some money out it!'
Ross	 Can I get some of that action?'
Monica	 Wait a minute! Now I\xc2\x92m betting against all three of you?'
Rachel	 Oh honey, don\xc2\x92t worry. I really do feel like tomorrow\xc2\x92s the\nday.'
Monica	 Oh, okay!'
Joey	 Hey! Sleeping beauty!'
Chandler	 Where have you been?! I tried to call you! I want to talk to you! I\nstill feel so bad!'
Joey	 (in a baby voice) Oh no, were you upset? Did you lose sleep?'
Chandler	 I\xc2\x92m so sorry.'
Joey	 Uh-huh look, the only reason I can over here was to settle things between\nus! Okay? You\xc2\x92ve done a lot for me and my career, I wanted to pay you back so I took\nyou to the premiere but you missed it! Okay, so how much do I owe you?'
Chandler	 What?!'
Joey	 Give me a number, I don\xc2\x92t want to owe you anything!'
Chandler	 You don\xc2\x92t owe me anything, I don\xc2\x92t want you money\xc2\x85'
Joey	 Ah-ah-ah! We\xc2\x92re doing this! Okay, now you got me my first set of head\nshots. Right, how much were those?'
Chandler	 I don\xc2\x92t know, five hundred dollars?'
Joey	 Okay, five hundred dollars. What else?'
Chandler	 Well then there was the second set, the infamous booger head shots.'
Joey	 Okay, so that\xc2\x92s another five hundred. Five hundred and five hundred,\nthat\xc2\x92s\xc2\x85 (Pauses to figure it out.)'
Chandler	 Do you want a calculator?'
Joey	 Please! '
Chandler	 Here! (Hands him one. Joey adds it up and discovers that he was\nright.)'
Joey	 All right, what else?'
Chandler	 Well uh, there was acting classes, stage combat classes, tap\nclasses\xc2\x85'
Joey	 Which we\xc2\x92re still keeping under our hats!'
Chandler	 Uh then there was that dialect coach who helped you with that play\nwhere you needed a southern accent. Which after twenty hours of lessons still came out\nJamaican. '
Joey	 What the hell are you talking about, (in a Jamaican accent) "The\nsouth will rise again man."'
Chandler	 Yes, money well spent!'
Joey	 Yeah. Okay, what else? Rent!'
Chandler	 Okay, two, three years of rent, utilities, food\xc2\x85'
Joey	 Okay. Okay, so I\xc2\x92m writing you a check for\xc2\x85So you fell asleep\nduring my movie. Big deal right? How do you clear this thing?'
Ross	 Come on, finish your enchilada.'
Rachel	 Ross I\xc2\x97We tried all the spicy food. It\xc2\x92s not working.'
Ross	 Okay here, have one of these peppers. Oh ha\xc2\x85 Oh God! So\xc2\x85so hot!\n(Rubs his eyes.) Oh my\xc2\x97(Laughs.) By the way, you don\xc2\x92t want to touch the pepper\nand then touch your eye.'
Rachel	 I am feeling nothing. Speaking of hot, watching you do that really makes\nme want to have sex with you.'
Ross	 Stop it.'
Rachel	 Oh come on Ross, why are we wasting our time with this other stuff?! We\nknow what\xc2\x92s gonna work! It\xc2\x92s doctor recommended!'
Ross	 I\xc2\x92m sorry, but we have to have some boundaries! My God, I\xc2\x92m\ndying.'
Rachel	 Oh come on Ross, we\xc2\x92ve done it before we\xc2\x92ll do it again,\nit\xc2\x92ll be a nice way to bookend the pregnancy.'
Ross	 This is insane, I\xc2\x92m not gonna make love to you just so that\nyou\xc2\x92ll go into labor.'
Rachel	 Make love? What are you a girl?'
Ross	 Always a great way to get in a man\xc2\x92s pants.'
Rachel	 But you will, you will be performing a service. Okay? Just-just think of\nme as a ketchup bottle, y\xc2\x92know you sometimes you have to bang on the end of it just\nto get something to come out.'
Ross	 I love when you talk dirty to me.'
Rachel	 Oh, I know it. You\xc2\x92re right. That\xc2\x92s not sexy. Oh\xc2\x85Oh!\n(Drops a fork on the floor.) Whoops! Oh, I seem to have dropped my fork. Let me just bed\nover and get it. (Tries too, but can\xc2\x92t quite seem to make it.) Oh God!'
Ross	 Okay enough! This is, this is not going to happen.'
Rachel	 Come on Ross! I\xc2\x92m miserable here! Come on! You started this, now\nyou finish it! Come on wuss, make love to me.'
Ross	 Y\xc2\x92know what?'
Rachel	 What?!'
Ross	 Forget it.'
Rachel	 Oh wow! What now Ross you\xc2\x92re not gonna talk? How on earth will you\never annoy me? Oh wait a minute, I know. (Mimics his breathing.) I mean you\xc2\x92d think\nthe damn jalepeno would\xc2\x92ve cleared up your sinuses, but no!! That\xc2\x92s not\nenough\xc2\x85 (Ross jumps over and kisses her.) What are you doing?!'
Ross	 I\xc2\x92m getting that baby out of you!'
Rachel	 (breaking the kiss) Oh God!'

Phoebe	 Thank you!'
Monica	 That\xc2\x92s it. I\xc2\x92m done. I don\xc2\x92t care when the baby comes, no\nmore betting.'
Phoebe	 Okay.'
Monica	 Hello? (Listens) Uh-huh. (Listens) Uh-huh. (Listens) Okay. (Hangs up.) I\nguess we can bet one more time.'
Phoebe	 Is Rachel having the baby?'
Monica	 How did you know that?! (Runs to yell at Joey\xc2\x92s apartment.) Joey!\nChandler!! It\xc2\x92s time!'
Phoebe	 They\xc2\x92re at the coffeehouse.'
Monica	 You know everything!! Oh wait, double or nothing. I bet you the baby is\nover seven pounds. (Phoebe isn\xc2\x92t interested.) I bet you it has hair. (She\xc2\x92s\nstill not interested.) I bet you it\xc2\x92s a girl.'
Phoebe	 We know it\xc2\x92s a girl! (Exits.)'
Monica	 (following her) I\xc2\x92ll give you really good odds.'
