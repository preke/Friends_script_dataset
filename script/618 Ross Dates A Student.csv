Ross	 Hey! I just got uh, my teacher evaluations! Check out what this one\nstudent wrote, "I loved Dr. Geller\xc2\x92s class. Mind blowing lectures! Dr. Geller,\nyou are definitely the hottie of the paleontology department!"'
Chandler	 Ahh, Hotties of the Paleontology Department, there\xc2\x92s a big\nselling calendar, eh?'
Rachel	 Who wrote it?'
Ross	 Oh, I wish I knew, but the evaluations are all anonymous.'
Joey	 Oh hey, do you still have their final exams?'
Ross	 Yeah.'
Joey	 Oh, \xc2\x91cause you can just match the evaluation to the exam with the\nsame handwriting and boom, there\xc2\x92s your admirer. (Ross is stunned.)'
Chandler	 A hot girl\xc2\x92s at stake and all of the sudden he\xc2\x92s Rain Man.'
Rachel	 Okay, wait a minute, wait a minute, why are we so sure that this is a\ngirl?'
Ross	 It\xc2\x92s a girl! Anyway, it wou\xc2\x97it wouldn\xc2\x92t matter. Okay?\nBecause I\xc2\x92m a teacher and she\xc2\x92s a student.'
Chandler	 Oh, is that against the rules?'
Ross	 No, but it is frowned upon.'
Chandler	 I see.'
Ross	 Besides, there\xc2\x92s a big age difference.'
Joey	 Oh, well think of it like this, when you\xc2\x92re 90\xc2\x85'
Ross	 I know when I\xc2\x92m 90 she\xc2\x92ll be like 80 and it won\xc2\x92t seem like\nsuch a big difference.'
Joey	 No that\xc2\x92s not what I was going to say at all. No, what I was going to\nsay is when you\xc2\x92re 90 you\xc2\x92ll still have the memory of what it was like to be\nwith a 20-year-old.'

Joey	 Hey Chandler! Y\xc2\x92know that girl you went to college with who-who\nbecame a movie director?'
Chandler	 Oh yeah, Dana Keystone. She was in my Movement class.'
Phoebe	 What\xc2\x92s a Movement class?'
Monica	 It\xc2\x92s Chandler\xc2\x92s way of pretending he didn\xc2\x92t take mime.'
Joey	 Oh well listen, anyway she\xc2\x92s directing the new Al Pacino movie. You\ngotta get me an audition!'
Chandler	 Oh, I don\xc2\x92t know man. I haven\xc2\x92t talked to her in like ten\nyears.'
Joey	 No-no-no, please-please Chandler I-I-I would owe you so much!'
Chandler	 You do owe me so much. You owe me three thousand, four\nhundred\xc2\x85'
Joey	 Hey-hey dude, why are you changing the subject? Why? Will you make the\ncall or what?'
Chandler	 Oh okay, I\xc2\x92ll-I\xc2\x92ll try.'
Joey	 All right! Thanks! You\xc2\x92re the best! Now listen, the last day of\nauditions is Thursday. Okay? So I gotta get in there by Thursday. Okay? Just remember\nThursday. Thursday. Can you remember Thursday?'
Chandler	 Yeah so, Tuesday?'
Joey	 (angrily) Thursday! Look if you need help remembering think of like this,\nthe third day. All right? Monday, one day. Tuesday, two day. Wednesday, when? Huh? What\nday? Thursday! The third day! Okay?!'
Chandler	 (sarcastically) Thank you.'
Joey	 Okay.'
Rachel	 (entering from the bathroom) Hey Mon? I\xc2\x92m gonna check my messages.'
Chandler	 You just thought of that in there?'
Monica	 Yeah sure, nature called, she wanted to see who else did.'
Rachel	 (on phone) Hello? (Shocked that someone answered.) Uh, Rachel. (To the\ngang.) Great, someone is in our apartment. Call the cops!'
Monica	 You\xc2\x92re on the phone!'
Rachel	 (on phone) Oh my God! Oh my God! Thank you! (Hangs up) That was the fire\ndepartment, there was a fire at our place!'
Phoebe	 Oh my God! How bad was it?'
Rachel	 Well, he didn\xc2\x92t say, but it was a fire. I\xc2\x92m guessing not very\ngood. Come on, we gotta go!'
Monica	 Come on! (The girls all run out and Joey holds up Chandler by smiling.)'
Chandler	 What are you smiling about? What is so funny?'
Joey	 The part I want to audition for is a fireman, this is so meant to be!'
Burt	 (another professor) Wow! It looks like you were very generous with your\ngrades this semester! (Ross frantically starts to change some as a female student,\nElizabeth, approaches.)'
Ross	 (startled) Yeah?'
Ross	 Oh thank you. Thanks very much. (Leans up against the board and on a\nthumbtack.) Ow! (He pulls away.)'
Ross	 That was you?'
Ross	 Oh I, I don\xc2\x92t-I don\xc2\x92t think that would be the best idea.'
Ross	 What time?'
Ross	 Gotcha. (Starts to leave.)'
Ross	 Oh! So-so seriously, what time?'
Phoebe	 Coming through! (Has to dodge a fireman) Oh! Coming through! (Sees a\ncute one.) Oh! Hello! Hi! (Smiles then realizes) No! Right! Coming through! '
Monica	 Oh well, it\xc2\x92s not so bad. '
Fireman #1	 Yeah, most of the damage is pretty mostly contained in the bedrooms.'
Phoebe	 Oh!'
Rachel	 My God! (They both run into the bedrooms.)'
Joey	 (to the fireman) Hey buddy, do you think I can borrow your uniform this\nThursday?'
Fireman #1	 Excuse me?'
Monica	 Joey! He\xc2\x92s working! (To Chandler) You would look good in\nthat.'
Joey	 Oh, how bad is it?'
Phoebe	 Oh, it\xc2\x92s bad. It\xc2\x92s really bad. The only thing in there that\nisn\xc2\x92t burned is an ass. Which I do not remember buying!'
Chandler	 How\xc2\x92s your room Rach?'
Rachel	 Everything\xc2\x92s ruined. My bed. My clothes. Look at my favorite blue\nsweater. (Hold it up.)'
Monica	 Isn\xc2\x92t that mine?'
Rachel	 Fine! I\xc2\x92m sorry for your loss! (Hands it back to her.)'
Fireman #1	 So uh, you\xc2\x92re not gonna be able to live here for a while, you\nladies have a place to stay?'
Rachel	 (stands up) Wow! Oh-okay, look pal, I am not in the mood to be\nhit on right now! But if you give me your number I will call you some other time.'
Monica	 (pulling Rachel back down) Yes, they can stay with us.'
Chandler	 Have you figured out what started the fire Mr. Fireman?'
Fireman #1	 Well uh, do either of you smoke?'
Phoebe	 No, not usually. But yeah, I could use one right now.'
Fireman #1	 No-no-no, do you uh light candles? Burn incense?'
Phoebe	 Yes! I do! All the time! I love them! Oh my God! I did it! It\xc2\x92s me!\nIt\xc2\x92s me! I burned down the house! I burned down the house!'
Rachel	 Okay Phoebe calm down, there\xc2\x92s no need to place blame. Okay? (To\nthe fireman) I warned her about those candles.'
Chandler	 God, it\xc2\x92s great to catch up! I can\xc2\x92t believe how long\nit\xc2\x92s been!'
Joey	 Chandler, is that\xc2\x85 (Mimes someone using a movie camera and Chandler\nnods yes.)'
Chandler	 (on phone) Oh that\xc2\x92s great! Good for you.'
Joey	 Hey-hey listen\xc2\x85 (Chandler waves him away.)'
Chandler	 Okay! So yeah, maybe we can get together umm\xc2\x85 (Joey mimes\nthrowing something in the air, catching it, rolling it out, putting it in an oven and\ncutting it.) Can you hold for one second please? (To Joey) What?!'
Joey	 When you\xc2\x92re off the phone, do you wanna get a pizza?'
Chandler	 (on phone) Hi! I\xc2\x92m back. (Goes to hang up the phone.) Yeah, that\nsounds great. (Listens) Okay. Well, we\xc2\x92ll do it then. (Listens) Okay, bye-bye. (He\nhangs up the phone and turns around to see Joey standing close to him and screams.)'
Joey	 Hey listen, so when\xc2\x92s-when\xc2\x92s my audition? I mean I know\nit\xc2\x92s Thursday, but what time?'
Chandler	 Hi.'
Monica	 Hey!'
Chandler	 (To Joey) We didn\xc2\x92t get to the audition. I\xc2\x92m gonna take her\nto coffee and then we\xc2\x92ll do it then.'
Joey	 Ah-ha!'
Monica	 Wow! So, now you\xc2\x92re going on a date with this girl?'
Chandler	 Honey, it is not a date! I haven\xc2\x92t talked to her in ten years!\nYou can\xc2\x92t just call up somebody you haven\xc2\x92t talked to in ten years and ask them\nfor a favor. There are rules, y\xc2\x92know? You gotta, you got to put in some time.'
Monica	 You\xc2\x92re right, I\xc2\x92m sorry. It\xc2\x92s not like you\xc2\x92re\ny\xc2\x92know, going out with an ex-girlfriend.'
Chandler	 No, we only went out once.'
Monica	 You dated her!'
Chandler	 Not once!'
Monica	 All right, well why don\xc2\x92t I go out with an ex-boyfriend and do Joey\na favor?!'
Joey	 Hey, you wanna do Joey a favor, maybe you go out with Joey. (He turns\naround to see Chandler glaring at him.)'
Chandler	 (laughs) Oh that\xc2\x92s great, my friend Joey\xc2\x92s in the movie\nbusiness.'
Dana	 Y\xc2\x92know who I ran into from school? Howie.'
Chandler	 (giggles) My friend\xc2\x92s name is Joey.'
Dana	 Apparently Howie\xc2\x92s editing now. Yeah, he-he-he calls me up and asks\nme if he can edit my new movie. Can you believe that?! Y\xc2\x92know I-I-I haven\xc2\x92t\nspoken to him in like ten years and he asks me for a favor!'
Chandler	 Yeah, I\xc2\x92ve always hated that Howie.'
Dana	 No, no "How you doing?" Man, I mean not even a cup of coffee\nfirst!'
Chandler	 The nerve huh?'
Dana	 Yeah!'
Chandler	 Refill?'
Monica	 Now, this is last minute so I want to apologize for the mess. Okay?'
Rachel	 Oh my God! It sure didn\xc2\x92t look this way when I lived here.'
Monica	 I know! Now look, there\xc2\x92s only one problem though. There\xc2\x92s\nonly room for one, so I guess one of you will have to stay at Joey\xc2\x92s.'
Phoebe	 Well, since the fire was kinda my fault I guess (To Rachel) you should\nget to stay here.'
Rachel	 Hey! Hey-hey, now this was no one\xc2\x92s fault Pheebs. Okay? It was an\naccident.'
Phoebe	 Well no, it was my fault so you should get the nice room.'
Rachel	 Okay! (She jumps on the bed.)'
Monica	 So Rach! You\xc2\x92re the first guest at Hotel Monica! Umm, you\xc2\x92ll\njust have to tell me how you like your eggs in the morning. And I thought I would bring\nthem to you, y\xc2\x92know, in bed. Oh, you have been through so much.'
Rachel	 I have.'
Joey	 This right here is where I keep the pizza. (He points to the chair.) And\nuh that\xc2\x92s where the napkin is. (Points to the floor next to the chair.)'
Phoebe	 What\xc2\x92s that smell?'
Joey	 I know! (Shrugs his shoulders.)'
Elizabeth	 Oh please! It was such a big class! You never even noticed me!'
Ross	 What? Of course I did! You uh, you sat next to Sleepy Sleeperson.'
Elizabeth	 Who?'
Ross	 Oh uh, I had trouble remembering everyone\xc2\x92s name, so I-I kinda came\nup with nicknames. Like the guy on the other side of you was Smelly von Brownshirt.'
Elizabeth	 Oh yeah. So umm, did you have a nickname for me?'
Ross	 Umm, no. No.'
Elizabeth	 Yes you did! What was it?'
Ross	 Umm, it\xc2\x92s Cutie McPretty.'
Elizabeth	 Ohh that\xc2\x92s so sweet!'
Ross	 Listen, I gotta tell ya, I-I\xc2\x92m having a great time! Y\xc2\x92know how\nbefore you said it might be weird, the whole student teacher thing, and to be frank I\nthought it would be too, but it\xc2\x92s not. I mean it\xc2\x92s not at all.'
Burt	 (exiting from a restaurant) Dr. Geller!'
Ross	 (pushing Elizabeth into a doorway) Burt!'
Phoebe	 So did you sleep well last night?'
Rachel	 I did. '
Phoebe	 Yeah?'
Rachel	 I did, Monica was so sweet she left a little mint on my pillow.'
Phoebe	 Y\xc2\x92know what Joey left on my pillow?'
Rachel	 What?'
Phoebe	 Gum!'
Fireman #2	 Well, we determined the cause of the fire.'
Phoebe	 Yeah I know, it was my candle. My candle!'
Fireman #2	 No, there was an appliance left on in the bathroom. It\xc2\x92s looks\nlike a curling iron.'
Phoebe	 I don\xc2\x92t use a curling iron.'
Fireman #2	 Well someone does.'
Rachel	 Well, don\xc2\x92t look at me! My hair\xc2\x92s straight! Straight!\nStraight! Straight!'
Fireman #2	 It could\xc2\x92ve been a hair straightener.'
Rachel	 Oh.'
Joey	 This is where I keep the pizza. (It\xc2\x92s the same location as before.)\nAnd\xc2\x97Hey! Where did the napkin go?! (The napkin is not in it\xc2\x92s spot.)'

Monica	 Now there you go! I wouldn\xc2\x92t want my best guest to strain her eyes!'
Phoebe	 Thanks Monica!'
Monica	 Does that smell bother you?'
Phoebe	 What the smell from Joey\xc2\x92s? No, I can hardly smell it over here.'
Monica	 Well you let me know if you can, because y\xc2\x92know I can bake a pie to\ncover it.'
Phoebe	 I can smell it a little, bake the pie.'
Monica	 Okay!'
Phoebe	 Okay.'
Monica	 Hello? (Listens) Oh yes, one minute please. (To Phoebe) It\xc2\x92s for\nyou. It\xc2\x92s the fire inspector.'
Phoebe	 Oh! (Takes the phone.) Hello? (Listens) Yeah this is Phoebe. (Listens)\nReally?!'
Joey	 (in a funny voice) Yeah, so it turns out that it wasn\xc2\x92t the hair\nstraightener that started the fire. (Rachel prompts him on what to say next.) No-no, it\nwas the candles. It\xc2\x92s very not good leaving candles unattended. In fact, one of the\nfirst things they teach you in fire school is\xc2\x85 (Phoebe suddenly enters.) Uhh\xc2\x85\nUhh\xc2\x85 Okay. Well, I have to go now. (Phoebe leaves.)'
Ross	 We had such a great time! She\xc2\x92s-she\xc2\x92s incredible! I thought\nthe-the age difference might be a problem, but it wasn\xc2\x92t. It wasn\xc2\x92t at all.\nElizabeth is very mature for her age. (Joey makes the international sign for big boobies.)\n(To Monica) A concept lost on some people!'
Monica	 So it\xc2\x92s okay to date a student.'
Ross	 Well, not really. I mean technically it\xc2\x92s-it\xc2\x92s not against the\nrules or anything, but it is frowned upon. Especially by that professor we ran into last\nnight, Judgey von Holierthanthou.'
Monica	 Well Ross, you be careful now. You don\xc2\x92t want to get a reputation\nas y\xc2\x92know Professor McNailshisstudents. '
Ross	 Yeah. What-what should I do?'
Joey	 Well Ross, it seems pretty clear. I mean what\xc2\x92s more important? What\npeople think or how you feel, huh? Ross, you gotta follow your heart.'
Monica	 Joey that is so sweet.'
Chandler	 (entering) Hey.'
Joey	 Hey-hey-hey! So, how did it go with Dana? Any reason I should leave a\nblock of time open say Thursday?'
Chandler	 I couldn\xc2\x92t do it.'
Joey	 You couldn\xc2\x92t do it?!'
Chandler	 Hey, relax I just need more time. We\xc2\x92re going to dinner tonight.'
Monica	 What?! You\xc2\x92re going out with her again!'
Ross	 Going out with who?'
Chandler	 Uh, Dana Keystone from college.'
Ross	 Oh yeah! Wasn\xc2\x92t she uh\xc2\x85 (Does the international sign for big\nboobies.)'
Chandler	 No, that was Dana Caplin.'
Monica	 Joey! You didn\xc2\x92t even know her!'
Joey	 Ah whatever!'
Chandler	 Great story again! The yarns that you weave! Woo-hoo-hoo!'
Dana	 Y\xc2\x92know uh, actually I-I-I should get going.'
Chandler	 Oh no-no-no! Stay! Stay! Because you-you should you-you-you should\nstay!'
Dana	 Wow. Oh, I am really flattered, but I just I don\xc2\x92t feel that way\nabout you.'
Chandler	 Oh no-no-no, that\xc2\x92s not\xc2\x97No-no-no!'
Dana	 I\xc2\x92m sorry Chandler, y\xc2\x92know you are such a sweet guy and I, I\ndon\xc2\x92t want to hurt you. Oh, I wish there was something I can do to make you feel\nbetter.'
Chandler	 No-no\xc2\x97Really?!'
Dana	 Of course!'
Chandler	 (breaking up) Well, it just hurts so bad. I uh\xc2\x85'
Dana	 Ohh, I\xc2\x92m sorry.'
Chandler	 Well maybe there is one thing you can do.'
Dana	 What?! Anything! Anything! '
Chandler	 Well, I umm, I mean this is just off the top of my head now, umm but I\nhave this friend. This actor friend and he would kill me if he thought I was doing this\numm, but umm would it be possible for him to get an audition for your movie say on\nThursday?'
Dana	 Absolutely! But you-you would really feel better about me rejecting you if\nyour actor friend can audition for my movie?'
Chandler	 Well, the heart wants what it wants. I\xc2\x92ll see you later. (He runs\noff and leaves her with the bill, which the waiter promptly delivers.)'
Monica	 Hey! How\xc2\x92s it goin\xc2\x92?'
Phoebe	 Well, not much has changed in the last five minutes.'
Monica	 Yes it has! I made cookies!'
Phoebe	 Oh that\xc2\x92s all right. I\xc2\x92m still full from your homemade potato\nchips.'
Monica	 But you should eat them now because they\xc2\x92re hot from the oven.'
Phoebe	 Okay. (Reaches for one.)'
Monica	 (pulling the plate back) Oh-ho! But not in here! Can\xc2\x92t eat \xc2\x91em\nin bed, remember? No crumbies!'
Phoebe	 (gritting her teeth) Okay, I\xc2\x92ll be out in a second.'
Monica	 Okay!'
Monica	 (opening the door) What are you doing?'
Phoebe	 That doesn\xc2\x92t lock does it?'
Rachel	 Oh, Joey! Sorry!'
Joey	 No that\xc2\x92s all right. Don\xc2\x92t worry about it.'
Rachel	 Oh but look! That\xc2\x92s gonna leave a stain! '
Joey	 Rach! Hey! It\xc2\x92s fine! You\xc2\x92re at Joey\xc2\x92s!'
Rachel	 Really?'
Joey	 Yeah! Look! (He throws some of his spaghetti on the floor.)'
Rachel	 I\xc2\x92ve never lived like this before.'
Joey	 I know.'
Joey	 All right, don\xc2\x92t waste it, I mean its still food. (He picks it up and\neats it.)'
Ross	 What do you want to do now? Huh? You wanna go get a drink?'
Elizabeth	 Uhh, I can\xc2\x92t.'
Ross	 Oh, you have some studying to do?'
Elizabeth	 No, I have some turning 21 to do.'
Ross	 Y\xc2\x92know I remember when uh, when I was in college, we used to\xc2\x85\n(He sees some of his colleagues enter and puts his head on her lap.)'
Elizabeth	 What are you doing?'
Ross	 Nothing, I\xc2\x92m-I\xc2\x92m just, I\xc2\x92m so comfortable with you!'
Elizabeth	 Do you not want to be seen with me?'
Ross	 What? No! Of course, of course I do! Are-are they gone?'
Elizabeth	 Uh no, they\xc2\x92re still here but I think I\xc2\x92m about to leave.'
Ross	 What?! No! No! Wait! You\xc2\x92re right, this is stupid. Who cares what\npeople think? I mean, I mean we like each other right? There\xc2\x92s nothing wrong with\nthat. Come on. (They get up and go over to the table where his colleagues are sitting.)\nBurt? Lydia? Mel? This is Elizabeth.'
Elizabeth	 Hi!'
Lydia	 Aren\xc2\x92t you in my Popular Culture class?'
Ross	 That\xc2\x92s right Lydia, Elizabeth here is a student and uh, we\xc2\x92re\ndating. And you may frown upon that, but we\xc2\x92re not gonna hide it anymore.'
Mel	 You are so fired.'
Ross	 What?'
Burt	 They\xc2\x92re gonna fire you! You can\xc2\x92t date a student! It\xc2\x92s\nagainst the rules.'
Ross	 Really? Its not just frowned upon?'
Rachel	 I love it at Joey\xc2\x92s!'
Joey	 Hey, here you go. (Hands her another one.)'
Chandler	 (entering, sees Rachel\xc2\x92s throw) Ni-hi-ice! '
Rachel	 Thanks!'
Chandler	 (To Joey) So, you busy Thursday?'
Joey	 Oh, very funny. I don\xc2\x92t know if you remember, but my audition was\nsupposed to be Thursday. (Chandler doesn\xc2\x92t say anything until Joey figures it out.)\nYou got me the audition?! Let\xc2\x92s hug it up! (They hug.)'
Chandler	 Okay. Okay. (Joey puts him down.) What are you gonna do to me if you\nget the part?'
Phoebe	 (entering) Hey! Hi!'
Rachel	 Hi!'
Phoebe	 (To Rachel) Listen umm, yeah okay, I need to talk to you!'
Rachel	 Uh-huh.'
Phoebe	 Now I know that they said that the umm, the hair straightener started\nthe fire but I think I\xc2\x92m partly at fault. You see, I didn\xc2\x92t, I didn\xc2\x92t tell\nyou but umm, but I-I had recently refilled the tissues and so y\xc2\x92know let\xc2\x92s just\nface it, that\xc2\x92s just kindling! So I think it\xc2\x92s better that I stay at\nJoey\xc2\x92s.'
Rachel	 No, no-no-no. Phoebe, this was my fault and besides y\xc2\x92know what?\nI\xc2\x92m fine here.'
Phoebe	 Okay. Oh umm, Chandler, Monica is looking for you.'
Chandler	 Really?'
Phoebe	 Yeah she said something about crumbies.'
Chandler	 No! No! No! I was so careful! (Runs out.)'
Phoebe	 (To Rachel) Okay, you have to switch with me! Monica is driving me\ncrazy!'
Joey	 That\xc2\x92s right, all the ladies want to stay at Joey\xc2\x92s.'
Rachel	 No! No! Phoebe, come on! I don\xc2\x92t want to switch! Please come on! I\ncan throw wet paper towels here!'
Phoebe	 No but at Monica\xc2\x92s you can eat cookies over the sink!'
Rachel	 I know. I\xc2\x92m sorry.'
Phoebe	 All right fine! This looks like so much fun. (Examining the bowl of wet\npaper towels.)'
Joey	 Yeah. '
Phoebe	 God, what a mess. (She grabs the bowl and heads for Monica\xc2\x92s.)'
Ross	 Wow! It actually is in the handbook. I can\xc2\x92t date you or have a hot\nplate in my office. I can\xc2\x92t believe we have to stop seeing each other.'
Elizabeth	 For what it\xc2\x92s worth I did appreciate you standing up for me. It\nfelt really nice. It kinda made me like you even more.'
Ross	 I know, I know I really like you too. But we-we can\xc2\x92t date. It\xc2\x92s\nagainst the rules. It\xc2\x92s forbidden.'
Elizabeth	 Wow!'
Ross	 What?'
Elizabeth	 Just hearing you describe it as forbidden, it\xc2\x92s really hot.'
Ross	 Really?'
Elizabeth	 Yeah.'
Ross	 Well I-I-I don\xc2\x92t care how hot it is it\xc2\x92s-it\xc2\x92s uh, it\xc2\x92s\nwrong.'
Elizabeth	 Stop it! (She starts to get all worked up.)'
Ross	 (feeling it too) No! No! It\xc2\x92s wrong! It\xc2\x92s-it\xc2\x92s-it\xc2\x92s\nnaughty. It\xc2\x92s taboo.'
Elizabeth	 Shut the book!'
Ross	 Let\xc2\x92s also get a hot plate!'

Chandler	 Hey!'
Joey	 Hey!'
Chandler	 So?!'
Joey	 So?'
Chandler	 It\xc2\x92s Thursday! How was the audition?!'
Joey	 Wh? Monday, one day. Tuesday, two day. Wednesday, when huh what?\nThurs\xc2\x97(He gasps in horror.) Oh! (Runs out and Chandler just shakes his head. After a\nsecond Joey runs back in to grab a piece of pizza and runs back out.)'
