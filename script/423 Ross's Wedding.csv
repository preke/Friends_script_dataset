Monica	 Guys, hurry up! The flight leaves in four hours! It could take time to\nget a taxi! There could be traffic! The plane could leave early! When we get to London,\nthere could be a line at customs! Come on!! (She runs back to her apartment.)'
Chandler	 Six-hour trip to London. That\xc2\x92s a lot of Monica.'
Monica	 Passport, check! (As she puts away each item, she says check.) Camera,\ncheck! Traveller\xc2\x92s cheques, check! '
Rachel	 Who are you saying "check" too?'
Monica	 Myself. Y\xc2\x92know for remembering to pack a thing. Yeah, you do a good\nthing, you get a check! (pause) My mom does it, I never realized it was weird.'
Phoebe	 Yeah, my mom used to put her head in the oven. Well, actually, she only\ndid it the one time. But it was pretty weird.'
Ross	 (entering) Hey!'
Monica	 Hey!'
Ross	 Hey! Are you ready yet?'
Monica	 Yep! You got the tickets?'
Ross	 Oh! Got \xc2\x91em right here, (Pats his coat pocket) check!'
Joey	 It\xc2\x92s all London, baby! Here we go. (He takes a picture of a less than\nenthused Chandler and starts towards the girls\xc2\x92 apartment.)'
Chandler	 You got your passport?'
Joey	 Yeah, in my third drawer on my dresser. You don\xc2\x92t want to lose that.'
Joey	 Ohh!! (Runs to his room.)'
Chandler	 There it is.'

Monica	 Okay, if you need the vacuum, it\xc2\x92s in my closet on the left-hand\nside. Ah, the garbage bags are next to the refrigerator\xc2\x85'
Phoebe	 Okay, okay, but Rachel\xc2\x92s gonna be here too, can\xc2\x92t I just ask\nher this stuff?'
Monica	 Yeah, okay, give that a try!'
Chandler	 (entering, with Joey) All right! Let\xc2\x92s do it!'
Joey	 Woo-hoo!!'
Ross	 Yeah, cheerie-o! '
Joey	 London baby!'
Chandler	 Okay, \xc2\x91cause that\xc2\x92s not gonna get annoying.'
Joey	 (louder) London baby!!'
Chandler	 Hey, y\xc2\x92know what? I was wrong.'
Ross	 Well, we\xc2\x92re all here! I guess we should get going!'
Phoebe	 Ohhh, I wanna come over there and give you a hug and wish you luck on\nyour wedding, but I don\xc2\x92t\xc2\x97can\xc2\x92t get up.'
Ross	 Oh, I\xc2\x92ll-I\xc2\x92ll come hug you.'
Phoebe	 Great! Yeah, could you bring me the newspaper?'
Ross	 Yeah. (He does so and Phoebe hugs him.)'
Phoebe	 Oh, have a great wedding!'
Ross	 Thanks.'
Phoebe	 Oh, hey, Chandler I wanna hug you too!'
Chandler	 Hey! (Trots over)'
Phoebe	 Oh, and great! You might as well bring me my book, it\xc2\x92s on the\ncounter in your apartment.'
Chandler	 Oh. (Goes and gets Phoebe\xc2\x92s book as Rachel comes in from her\nroom.)'
Ross	 (to Rachel) So, we\xc2\x92re off.'
Rachel	 Have fun!'
Ross	 Thanks! (They hug.) Ugh, I can\xc2\x92t believe you\xc2\x92re not gonna be\nthere!'
Rachel	 Oh, I know.'
Ross	 So-so come! Why don\xc2\x92t you come?'
Rachel	 What?!'
Ross	 To London! Come to London. Please? It\xc2\x92ll mean so much to me.'
Rachel	 Yeah, well, I gotta work, I\xc2\x92m sorry.'
Ross	 Why-why can\xc2\x92t you take a couple of days off?'
Rachel	 Because, I can\xc2\x92t! Ross, I told you, no. I can\xc2\x92t.'
Ross	 This is my wedding.'
Monica	 All right, y\xc2\x92know what? We really are late! Let\xc2\x92s go!\nLet\xc2\x92s go! Let\xc2\x92s go!!'
Ross	 Fine. You\xc2\x92ll-you\xc2\x92ll watch it on video when we get back.'
Chandler	 (entering, with Phoebe\xc2\x92s book.) Here you go Phoebe! Here you go\nPhobo! Phewbedo! Phaybobo.'
Phoebe	 (laughs) Thank you.'
Phoebe	 Thank you. (She pats him on his head.)'
Ross	 All right, let\xc2\x92s go! Bye, Pheebs!'
Joey	 Bye, Pheebs!'
Joey	 London baby!! (And Rachel slowly closes the door, sadly.)'
Phoebe	 Oh, do you need a hug? You don\xc2\x92t have to bring me anything!'
Joey	 Come on! Do something!'
Chandler	 I am, I\xc2\x92m ignoring you.'
Joey	 Okay, here! (Gives him the camera.) I wanna be the on camera guy. All\nright, first stop, Westminster Abbey. (Joey folds out his "pop-up" map of\nLondon. All of the major landmarks pop-up like in a pop-up book.)'
Chandler	 Oh, what the hell is that?'
Joey	 It\xc2\x92s London, baby! All right, the hotel\xc2\x92s here. (Points to the\nmap.) Wait. No, we wanna go\xc2\x85 No. I know. (Sets the map down.) I\xc2\x92m gonna have to\ngo into the map. (So Joey literally steps into the map.)'
Chandler	 Okay, if you see a little version of me in there? Kill it!'
Joey	 I got it! (Picks up the map and starts walking.) Here we go.'
Chandler	 Okay. Listen-listen, we\xc2\x92re not gonna have to walk this way the\nentire time are we?'
Joey	 Shhh! (Pause) Man, you made me lose it! (He goes into the map again.)'
Emily	 \xc2\x85and that was all before 10 o\xc2\x92clock. The caterer rang and said\nit was going to be Chicken Kiev instead of Chicken Tarragon. And then the florist phoned\nto say there aren\xc2\x92t any tulips. Oh, and the chilliest has carpel-tunel syndrome.\nWe\xc2\x92re not gonna be\xc2\x85'
Ross	 Whoa-whoa-whoa! Emily, (Gives her the time-out signal.) honey, okay?'
Emily	 Well, up yours too!'
Ross	 What?! No! No! That\xc2\x92s-that\xc2\x92s time-out!'
Emily	 Sorry.'
Ross	 Sweetie, you gotta relax. Everything\xc2\x92s gonna be great, okay? Come on.\nCome on.'
Monica	 Chicken Kiev?'
Ross	 Um-hmm! Doesn\xc2\x92t that sound delicious at the last minute?'
Monica	 Yeah, y\xc2\x92know, but something like salmon which would be so much more\nelegant than the chicken. And, you wouldn\xc2\x92t have to worry about the salmonella. (Ross\npushes her.) So, I can\xc2\x92t wait to see this place you\xc2\x92re getting married!'
Ross	 Yeah. Yeah. Yes, this place is beautiful. Emily\xc2\x92s parents got married\nhere.'
Emily	 I still can\xc2\x92t believe they\xc2\x92re tearing it down. It really is the\nmost lovely building you\xc2\x92ll ever see. I mean it\xc2\x92s over\xc2\x85 (She stops\nsuddenly, when she sees that demolition has already started.) Oh my God!'
Monica	 It\xc2\x92s nice.'
Emily	 Oh. Oh. (She starts running towards the building.)'
Emily	 (running in, with Ross) Oh. Oh my God. How can this be happening? What\nare we going to do?'
Ross	 It\xc2\x92s all right! Everything\xc2\x92s gonna be all right.'
Emily	 How\xc2\x92s it gonna be all right?!'
Ross	 Uh-huh, I see that.'
Monica	 (entering) Okay, I talked to the guy with the shovel and I found out\nwhat happened. '
Ross	 What? What?'
Monica	 They torn it down a few days early.'
Joey	 All right! Westminster Abbey! Hands down, best Abbey I\xc2\x92ve ever seen.\nHey! (Pushes Chandler in front of the camera.) Okay. What do you think of the Abbey,\nChandler?'
Chandler	 I think it\xc2\x92s great. It\xc2\x92s great. Y\xc2\x92know, they\xc2\x92re\nthinking of changing the name of this place.'
Joey	 Really? To what?'
Chandler	 To Put the Camera Away!!!'
Joey	 Man, you are Westminster Crabby. (He starts chasing Chandler\ntowards the Abbey.)'
Phoebe	 Oh. Oh.'
Rachel	 Oh, honey! Don\xc2\x92t get up! What do you need?'
Phoebe	 Oh, no. Oh, nothing.'
Rachel	 Come on! I am here to take care of you! What do you need? Anything.'
Phoebe	 Okay, I have a wedgie.'
Rachel	 Okay, that is all you.'
Phoebe	 So-so, what do you want for lunch?'
Rachel	 Oh, I don\xc2\x92t know. I guess we have to eat.'
Phoebe	 Yeah, I do. What\xc2\x92s the matter?'
Rachel	 I\xc2\x92m just bummed about the way I left things with Ross. I\nshouldn\xc2\x92t have lied to him about having to work. He seemed so mad at me.'
Phoebe	 Eh, don\xc2\x92t be so hard on yourself. If someone I was still in love\nwith was getting married\xc2\x85'
Rachel	 (interrupting) Still in love with?! '
Phoebe	 Yeah!'
Rachel	 I\xc2\x92m not in love with Ross!'
Phoebe	 Oh. No. No. Good! Yeah, me neither.'
Rachel	 Phoebe, I\xc2\x92m going to Ross\xc2\x92s wedding because he is my\nex-boyfriend and that would be really uncomfortable. Not because, I\xc2\x92m still in\nlove with him! I mean, hey, y\xc2\x92know, I like Ross as much as the next guy, y\xc2\x92know?\nClearly I have feelings for him, but feelings don\xc2\x92t mean love! I mean, I still\nhave loving feelings for Ross. Yeah! But, I have, I have continuing feelings of love, but\nthat doesn\xc2\x92t mean that-that I\xc2\x92m still in love with him. Y\xc2\x92know? I-I have\nsexual feelings for him, but I do love him\xc2\x97Ohh! Oh my God! Oh my\xc2\x97why\ndidn\xc2\x92t you tell me?!!'
Phoebe	 We thought you knew!'
Rachel	 We?!'
Phoebe	 Yeah, we all know! We talk about it all the time!'
Rachel	 You all know? Does Ross know?'
Phoebe	 Oh no, Ross doesn\xc2\x92t know anything.'
Rachel	 Oh, I can not believe you didn\xc2\x92t tell me!'
Phoebe	 Well, because we thought you knew!! It\xc2\x92s so obvious! God, that\nwould be like telling Monica, "Hey, you like things clean."'
Joey	 Hey!'
The Vendor	 So, what are you guys in the market for? We\xc2\x92ve got uh, scarves,\ntulip post cards...'
Joey	 Check this out? Huh? (Joey has this big tall hat with a British flag on\nthe front of it.) Yeah. That\xc2\x92s the stuff. What do you think?'
Chandler	 Well, I don\xc2\x92t have to buy that, "I\xc2\x92m with stupid"\nT-shirt anymore.'
Joey	 Well, I like it. Here you go. (He pays for the hat.)'
Chandler	 All right, look, you\xc2\x92re not really gonna buy that are you?\nDon\xc2\x92t you think you\xc2\x92ve embarrassed me enough for one day?'
Joey	 Oh, I embarrass you? '
Chandler	 How can I answer that when I\xc2\x92m pretending I don\xc2\x92t know you?'
The Vendor	 He\xc2\x92s just jealous. You\xc2\x92ll fit right in; all Londoners wear\nthem!'
Chandler	 Oh really? Then how come no one here is wearing them?'
The Vendor	 (looks around) They\xc2\x92re all tourists.'
Chandler	 All right, look, if you insist on wearing that, in public,\ny\xc2\x92know, you\xc2\x92re gonna spend the rest of the afternoon all by yourself.'
Joey	 Oh yeah? (Puts the hat on.) If you\xc2\x92re gonna make me choose between\nyou and the hat? I choose the hat.'
The Vendor	 Good choice.'
Joey	 Thanks.'
Chandler	 Okay, wait. All right, that\xc2\x92s it, okay, I\xc2\x92m out of here. I\nam not going to be embarrassed anymore! (He trips over a box, falls into a flower stand\nand walks away trying to be cool.)'
Emily	 Hello?'
Ross	 Hey! I just spoke to your dad, and you know what? He seems to think\nwe\xc2\x92ll be able to find a new place for the wedding.'
Emily	 We don\xc2\x92t have to.'
Ross	 Whoa-whoa-what? You found a place?'
Emily	 No. But, Monica and I were talking, and-and I was so upset about the hall\nbeing knocked down, and she suggested that we put the wedding off for a bit.'
Ross	 She said what?'
Emily	 She said, "If I\xc2\x92m not gonna be happy getting married somewhere\nthat we find in a day, well then we should just postpone it."'
Ross	 Postpone it? Emily, do you think Monica realises how much our parents\nspent on this wedding? Do you my sister\xc2\x92s teeny-tiny little brain comprehends that\npeople took time out of their lives to fly thousands of miles to be here, huh? (He puts\nhis pants on backwards.) This isn\xc2\x92t right.'
Emily	 I realize that people are going to be disappointed. But, I\xc2\x92m sure\nthey\xc2\x92ll come back when we can do it right.'
Ross	 I can\xc2\x92t ask people to do that? Would you ask people to do that?\n(Holds out his pants)'
Emily	 Don\xc2\x92t you point your pants at me! (She throws them on the floor.) We\nhave no choice! Anywhere that\xc2\x92s half-decent would\xc2\x92ve be booked months ago, Ross\ndon\xc2\x92t you understand? This is our wedding I\xc2\x92m talking about.'
Ross	 The only thing I understand is; postponing it is not an option. This is\nwhen we\xc2\x92re getting married.'
Emily	 So what are you saying? It\xc2\x92s now or never?'
Ross	 No. I\xc2\x92m saying it\xc2\x92s now. (He starts putting on his pants,\nbackwards again.)'
Emily	 Or?'
Ross	 There\xc2\x92s no \xc2\x91or\xc2\x92 in mind. What is wrong with these pants?!!'
Emily	 It\xc2\x92s not the pants. It\xc2\x92s you that is backwards. And if, and if\nyou don\xc2\x92t understand how important this is to me, well then, perhaps we\nshouldn\xc2\x92t get married at all! (She storms out.)'
Ross	 (chasing her, trying to zip up his pants. His got them on right now.) No,\nwait! Emily! No, wait, stop! Emily, please\xc2\x97(He catches something important in the\nzipper and howls like a little boy and falls to the floor.)'

Phoebe	 Hey!'
Rachel	 (depressed) Hi.'
Phoebe	 So, did shopping make you feel any better about Ross?'
Rachel	 Manhattan does not have enough stores.'
Phoebe	 Well, I think I can help you get over him.'
Rachel	 You can?'
Phoebe	 Yeah. I just need you to bring me some photos of Ross.'
Rachel	 Um-hmm.'
Phoebe	 And a small piece of chocolate.'
Rachel	 Okay.'
Phoebe	 And a glass of tepid water. (She gathers up all of these things.)'
Rachel	 Ooh, is this one of those things where you throw it in a bag with some\ngraveyard dirt and hang it from a north-facing tree?'
Phoebe	 Uh, only if you have the hiccups too. Yeah, the pictures are for you,\nthe water and the chocolate is for me. I just didn\xc2\x92t feel like getting up. Okay,\nI\xc2\x92m gonna show you a picture of Ross. Okay? And you\xc2\x92re going to remember all of\nthe bad things about him. All right? Really focus on his flaws.'
Rachel	 I can do that. I certainly did it when we were going out.'
Phoebe	 Okay. Umm, before we get started, I just wanna say for the record that I\nlove Ross, I think he\xc2\x92s such a great guy. Here. (Hands her the picture, Rachel grabs\nit out of her hand.) Okay, now, close your eyes. And imagine that you\xc2\x92re with Ross\nokay and imagine that you\xc2\x92re kissing him. And you\xc2\x92re-you\xc2\x92re running your\nhands all over his body. And then you run your hands through his hair, but eew-oh gross\nit\xc2\x92s some kind of grease, it\xc2\x92s\xc2\x97uck! Hah?'
Rachel	 I don\xc2\x92t know, his uh, his hair never really bothered me that much,\nand y\xc2\x92know it was always more crunchy than it was greasy.'
Phoebe	 Okay, this is going to be harder than I thought. Umm, let\xc2\x92s try\nsome uh, aversion therapy.'
Rachel	 Okay.'
Phoebe	 Okay?'
Rachel	 All right.'
Phoebe	 So uh, now look at the picture\xc2\x85'
Rachel	 Okay.'
Phoebe	 All right, and umm\xc2\x85 (She grabs the picture and smacks her in the\nhead.) '
Rachel	 Ow!'
Phoebe	 Okay, how do you feel now?'
Rachel	 Well, I like you less!'
Joey	 Hey.'
Chandler	 Hey. (He nods at the hat.)'
Joey	 Oh. (Takes off the hat.) Sorry!'
Chandler	 No-no-no, y\xc2\x92know what? I really shouldn\xc2\x92t have said that you\nwere embarrassing me, I mean that really wasn\xc2\x92t cool. And if it makes you feel any\nbetter, I\xc2\x92ve had a really lousy day.'
Joey	 Me too.'
Chandler	 Yeah?'
Joey	 Noo!! I\xc2\x92ve had the best day ever! Dude, check this out!'
Monica	 (entering) Hey!'
Joey	 Sh-shh-shh! (He motions for her to watch something he has taped.)'
Joey	 (on tape) Okay, so say hi to my friend and tell him that you like the hat.\n'
Fergie	 (Yep, Sarah, the Duchess of York) Okay, so umm, what\xc2\x92s your\nfriend\xc2\x92s name?'
Joey	 (on tape) Oh, Chandler.'
Fergie	 Hi Chandler! (Waves) '
Chandler	 That\xc2\x92s\xc2\x85 That\xc2\x92s was\xc2\x85'
Monica	 Oh my God!'
Joey	 That\xc2\x92s Fergie baby!!'
Fergie	 Joey says you don\xc2\x92t really like his hat, but I think it\xc2\x92s\nkinda dashing.'
Chandler	 How did you? How? How?'
Joey	 Well, I was trying to figure out how to get to Buckingham Palace, right?\nSo, I\xc2\x92m in my map and-and\xc2\x85(Ross enters) Hey!'
Monica	 Hey!'
Ross	 Hi. I understand you had a little talk with Emily.'
Monica	 (laughs) Yes, I did! And you are welcome!'
Ross	 Am I?! And was it your idea to postpone the wedding?!'
Monica	 Umm\xc2\x85'
Chandler	 I\xc2\x92m gonna go to the bathroom.'
Joey	 Wait up! (They both run to the bathroom.)'
Ross	 Hey-hey, since you\xc2\x92re the \xc2\x91fix-it\xc2\x92 lady, here\xc2\x92s a\npickle, what do you do when the bride says she doesn\xc2\x92t want to have the wedding at\nall?'
Monica	 She said that?!'
Ross	 Yeah.'
Monica	 Why?!'
Ross	 I don\xc2\x92t know, I told her it was stupid to put off the wedding just\nbecause the hall was gone and she liked flipped out.'
Monica	 Oh my God. You\xc2\x92re even dumber than I am!'
Ross	 Excuse me?'
Monica	 Ross, how long have you been planning this wedding?'
Ross	 I don\xc2\x92t know. A month?'
Monica	 Emily has probably been planning it since she was five! Ever since the\nfirst time she took a pillowcase and hung it off the back of her head. That\xc2\x92s what we\ndid! We dreamed about the perfect wedding, and the perfect place, with the perfect\nfour-tiered wedding cake (Starting to cry), with the little people on top. (Ross gets\nthrown a box of Kleenex from the bathroom and he gives her one.) Thanks. But the most\nimportant part is that we had the perfect guy who understood just how important all that\nother stuff was.'
Ross	 I had no idea. And that-that pillowcase thing, I thought you guys were\njust doing the flying nun.'
Monica	 Sometimes we were.'
Ross	 Come on. You gotta help me figure out what to do. Okay?'
Monica	 Okay.'
Ross	 Come on. (They leave and Chandler sticks his head out.)'
Chandler	 That was pretty intense huh?'
Joey	 Yeah. (Pause) Hey, I hope Ross didn\xc2\x92t think that we just went in\nthere because we were uncomfortable being out here!'
Chandler	 (glares at him) I hope he did!'
Phoebe	 Hello.'
Joey	 (on phone) Hey, Pheebs! It\xc2\x92s Joey!'
Phoebe	 Hey, Joey! Hey! Ooh! Ooh! I just say someone on the\xc2\x97that looks just\nlike you on the subway. And I was gonna go over and say \xc2\x91hi!\xc2\x92 but then I\nfigured, he doesn\xc2\x92t care if he looks like you.'
Joey	 That just cost me four bucks. But uh listen, I just called to see how the\nchick and the duck are doing?'
Phoebe	 Ohh, they\xc2\x92re having a great time with their Aunt Phoebe!\nAunt Rachel hasn\xc2\x92t been helpful at all. So, do you miss me?'
Joey	 Kinda, but I\xc2\x92ve just been having way too much fun.'
Phoebe	 So you\xc2\x92re not homesick yet?'
Joey	 No, I don\xc2\x92t think so.'
Phoebe	 All right, the seven of us miss you.'
Joey	 Who\xc2\x92s seven?'
Phoebe	 Y\xc2\x92know, me, Rachel, the birds, the babies\xc2\x85'
Joey	 Ahh, the babies miss me?'
Phoebe	 Ooh, the pizza guy\xc2\x92s here!'
Joey	 What? You ordered pizza without me?!'
Phoebe	 Yeah. But y\xc2\x92know we were thinking about you, y\xc2\x92know we ordered\nthe Joey Special.'
Joey	 Two pizzas?!'
Phoebe	 Yep! Okay, gotta go, talk to you later.'
Joey	 Wait, well, where did you get it from?! '
Emily	 Monica, why have you brought me here of all places?!'
Monica	 You\xc2\x92ll see.'
Emily	 I tell you, this wedding is not going to happen.'
Emily	 Oh God.'
Ross	 Okay? But-but imagine a lot more lights, okay? And-and y\xc2\x92know fewer\nbricks, and-and-and flowers, and candles\xc2\x85'
Monica	 And the musicians, look, they can go over here (Points to a little\nalcove), okay? And the chairs can face this way (Points), and\xc2\x85 (Points to Ross) You\ngo.'
Ross	 But-but, if you don\xc2\x92t love this, we\xc2\x92ll do it in any other place\nat any other time. Really, it\xc2\x92s fine, whatever you want.'
Emily	 It\xc2\x92s perfect.'
Ross	 And, I don\xc2\x92t know, if it starts to rain\xc2\x85'
Emily	 Well then we\xc2\x92ll get wet. (They kiss.)'
Monica	 Ohh. And I don\xc2\x92t even have a date.'
Rachel	 Pheebs?'
Phoebe	 Yeah?'
Rachel	 Do you remember where the duck food is?'
Phoebe	 Yeah, it\xc2\x92s in the guys\xc2\x92 apartment under the sink. Why?'
Rachel	 (enters with a bag packed) Because I\xc2\x92m going to London.'
Phoebe	 What?! What do you mean you\xc2\x92re going to London?'
Rachel	 Yeah, I have to tell Ross that I love him. Now honey, you take care, you\ndon\xc2\x92t have those babies until I get back. (Kisses her stomach.) '
Phoebe	 I\xc2\x97Rachel, you can\xc2\x92t go! Ross loves Emily!'
Rachel	 Yeah, I know, I know, I know he does. But I have to tell him how I feel!\nHe deserves to have all the information and then he can make an informed decision.'
Phoebe	 That\xc2\x92s not why you\xc2\x92re going! You\xc2\x92re going because you\nhope he\xc2\x92s gonna say, "Yeah, I love you too, Rach. Forget that British\nchippy."'
Rachel	 Ohh\xc2\x97Do you think he will?!'
Phoebe	 No! Because he\xc2\x92s in love with the British chippy! Look, Rachel, if\nyou go, you\xc2\x92re just gonna mess with his head and ruin his wedding! Y\xc2\x92know,\nit\xc2\x92s too late! You missed you\xc2\x92re chance! I\xc2\x92m sorry, I know this must be\nreally hard, it\xc2\x92s over.'
Rachel	 Y\xc2\x92know what? No. It\xc2\x92s not over until someone says, "I\ndo." (Exits)'
Phoebe	 I do! I do! I do! (Chases her into the hall, but Rachel doesn\xc2\x92t\nstop.) I do! (Gives up.) Ugh, like I can really chase you. I\xc2\x92m carrying a litter.'

Phoebe	 Oh...yes..is this..umm..Emily\xc2\x92s Parents\xc2\x92 house.'
Housekeeper	 Miss Waltham, is at the rehearsal dinner and it\xc2\x92s not polite\nto make fun of people. Goodbye.'
Chandler	 Joey, it\xc2\x92s been three days, okay.. Your just a little homesick,\nOkay. Would you just try to relax. Just, just try to enjoy yourself.'
Joey	 Hey. I spent the night out. I met this cute bridesmaid. She is so...'
