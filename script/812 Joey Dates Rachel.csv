Phoebe	 I didn\xc2\x92t know where to put it so I just left it here for now.'
Monica	 Oh well, maybe we can put it in the guest bedroom.'
Chandler	 Oh, okay. '
Monica	 All right. (He goes to push it and it doesn\xc2\x92t move.)'
Chandler	 I kinda like it here.'
Phoebe	 Do you really like it?'
Monica	 Are you kidding?! I practically spent my entire childhood at the arcade!\r\r\nThis is like\xc2\x97Oh my, this is like my second favorite game!'

Ross	 Hey! Oh, I\xc2\x92m so glad you guys are here. I\xc2\x92ve been dying to tell\r\r\nsomeone what happened in the Paleontology department today.'
Joey	 (To Rachel) Do you think he saw us or can we still sneak out?'
Ross	 Professor Neuman, the head of the department, so\xc2\x85.'
Rachel	 They made you head of the department!'
Ross	 No, I get to teach one of his advanced classes! (Pause) Why didn\xc2\x92t I\r\r\nget head of the department? (Goes and gets some coffee.)'
Joey	 Oh! Hey Rach, listen umm\xc2\x85'
Rachel	 Yeah.'
Joey	 I got a big date coming up, do you know a good restaurant?'
Rachel	 Uh, Paul\xc2\x92s Caf\xc3\xa9. They got great food and it\xc2\x92s really\r\r\nromantic.'
Joey	 Ooh, great! Thanks!'
Rachel	 Yeah! Oh, and then afterwards you can take her to the Four Seasons\r\r\nfor drinks. Or you go downtown and listen to some jazz. Or dancing\xc2\x97Oh! Take her\r\r\ndancing!'
Joey	 You sure are naming a lot of ways to postpone sex, I\xc2\x92ll tell ya\xc2\x85'
Rachel	 Ooh, I miss dating. Gettin\xc2\x92 all dressed up and going to a fancy\r\r\nrestaurant. I\xc2\x92m not gonna be able to do that for so long, and it\xc2\x92s so much fun!\r\r\nI mean not that sitting at home worrying about giving birth to a sixteen pound baby is not\r\r\nfun.'
Joey	 Hey, y\xc2\x92know what?'
Rachel	 Huh?'
Joey	 Why don\xc2\x92t I take you out?'
Rachel	 What?! Joey, you don\xc2\x92t want to go on a date with a pregnant lady.'
Joey	 Yes I do! And we\xc2\x92re gonna go out, we\xc2\x92re gonna have a good time,\r\r\nand take your mind off of childbirth and c-sections and-and giant baby heads stretching\r\r\nout\xc2\x85'
Rachel	 (interrupting) Okay! I\xc2\x92ll go with ya! I\xc2\x92ll go! I\xc2\x92ll go\r\r\nwith ya.'
Joey	 I\xc2\x92ll be fun.'
Rachel	 All right?'
Phoebe	 No. No! Yes! Ahh. Oh, would you look at that Monica? I just knocked off\r\r\nall of your top scores, how sad.'
Monica	 Okay, I\xc2\x92m next. (Phoebe starts another game.) Don\xc2\x92t!\r\r\nDon\xc2\x92t start another game! I said I\xc2\x92m next! Phoebe!'
Phoebe	 Oh, I\xc2\x92m sorry. I didn\xc2\x92t hear you over all the winning.'
Monica	 Chandler! Phoebe\xc2\x92s hogging the game!'
Chandler	 Who cares? It\xc2\x92s a stupid game.'
Monica	 You only think it\xc2\x92s stupid because you suck at it.'
Chandler	 I don\xc2\x92t suck. It\xc2\x92s sucks. You suck.'
Phoebe	 Wait okay, if this game is gonna cause problems between the two of you,\r\r\nthen maybe I should just keep it.'
Monica	 No! No-no! I love it! It is a great present! In fact, why don\xc2\x92t you\r\r\ngo home and wait for the thank you card?'
Chandler	 Why do you want to play this game so bad?'
Phoebe	 Yeah! It\xc2\x92s not like it spits out a Clark bar after every\r\r\ngame.'
Monica	 Okay. Phoebe that\xc2\x92s it. Come on, get out\xc2\x97out of the chair. Get\r\r\nout! (She goes to move Phoebe, but Phoebe goes limp and Monica can\xc2\x92t move her.) Oh\r\r\ncome\xc2\x85Phoebe!'
Rachel	 Joey? Could you get that? (There is no answer and she goes and opens the\r\r\ndoor to Joey.) What are you doing here? I thought you were in your room?'
Joey	 No, I\xc2\x92m picking you up for our date. These are for you. (Hands her\r\r\nsome flowers.)'
Rachel	 Ohh, Lilies. Joey, they\xc2\x92re my favorite. Thank you.'
Joey	 And, a brownie! (Hands her a bag with the brownie in it.) Well, half a\r\r\nbrownie. Actually, it\xc2\x92s just bag. It\xc2\x92s been a long walk from the flower shop and\r\r\nI was startin\xc2\x92 to feel faint so\xc2\x85'
Rachel	 Oh man! This is so great! I actually feel like I\xc2\x92m going on a real\r\r\ndate! Although, I have a hint of morning sickness, and I\xc2\x92m wearing underwear that\r\r\ngoes up to about\xc2\x85(She snaps the waistband on her underwear that is just slightly\r\r\nbelow her breasts)\xc2\x85there.'
Joey	 Hey come on now, this is a real date. Uh, so\xc2\x85nice place you got here.\r\r\nFoosball, huh? Pizza box. Oh, a subscription to Playboy, my kind of woman.'
Rachel	 Yeah, actually that\xc2\x92s my roommate\xc2\x92s.'
Joey	 I would like to meet him. He sounds like a stand up guy.'
Rachel	 Ah yes, but he\xc2\x92s very protective of me so you\xc2\x92d better watch\r\r\nyourself.'
Joey	 Ah\xc2\x85 Hey, so this roommate of yours\xc2\x85is he good looking?'
Rachel	 Hm-mmm.'
Joey	 Oh yeah, it must be tough to keep your hands of him, huh?'
Rachel	 (laughs) Yeah, but I\xc2\x92m pretty sure he\xc2\x92s gay.'
Joey	 No-no-no-no, he\xc2\x92s not! No! Why are you trying to ruin the game? Come\r\r\non!'
Ross	 \xc2\x85which brings us back, of course, to Greely\xc2\x92s theory of dominance.\r\r\n(The bell rings.) Okay, that-that\xc2\x92s all for today. Oh, uh does anyone know where the\r\r\nFreeman building is?'
Student	 Yeah, it\xc2\x92s the new building on Avenue A.'
Ross	 What?! That-that\xc2\x92s all the way cross town, I\xc2\x92m supposed to teach\r\r\na graduate seminar there in ten minutes.'
Student	 Ooh, dude. That\xc2\x92s not gonna happen.'
Ross	 Move it! Move it! Move it!! Hey!!! I\xc2\x92m the teacher!!'
Ross	 Hello. (He throws his jacket towards the coat rack and misses.) I\xc2\x92m\r\r\nsorry I\xc2\x92m a little late. Ah\xc2\x97(Checks his watch)\xc2\x97Whoa! A lot late. Let me\r\r\nstart by uh, by introducing myself, I am Professor Geller. (The bell rings.) So to sum up,\r\r\nI\xc2\x92m Professor Geller. Good job today.'
Rachel	 Now the filet mignon, what comes with that?'
Waitress	 There\xc2\x92s a side of steamed vegetables.'
Rachel	 Emmm. Now, instead of the vegetables, is there anyway I can substitute\r\r\nthe three-pound lobster?'
Joey	 Y\xc2\x92know what? Bring her both, and I\xc2\x92ll have the same. (The\r\r\nwaitress leaves.)'
Rachel	 Wow! This is shaping up to be a pretty good date\xc2\x97Oh, I almost\r\r\nforgot. I didn\xc2\x92t pay you the rent check.'
Joey	 Oh whoa-whoa-whoa, no roommate stuff. Okay? We\xc2\x92re on a date.'
Rachel	 Okay. Wow! So I get to see what Joey Tribbiani is like on a date. So do\r\r\nyou have any moves?'
Joey	 No! No. Umm, just myself and if they don\xc2\x92t like me for\xc2\x97(Laughs.)\r\r\nI\xc2\x92m sorry I couldn\xc2\x92t even get through that.'
Rachel	 I knew it! I knew it. Come on tell me your moves.'
Joey	 Oh alright. Umm, well, okay, I usually start by having a bottle of wine\r\r\nsent to my table from a fan.'
Rachel	 Oh my God. And that works?!'
Joey	 Well it does when you combine it with, "This is so embarrassing, I\r\r\njust want to have a normal life!"'
Rachel	 Oh, you poor little famous man.'
Joey	 Oh okay, how about this one. I was gonna wait until the end of the night\r\r\nto kiss you, but you\xc2\x92re so beautiful\xc2\x85I don\xc2\x92t think I can.'
Rachel	 (looks interested) Oh my God! Wow! That was fantastic, I almost leaned\r\r\nin. I really almost did!'
Joey	 Alright, so\xc2\x85so tell me one of your moves.'
Rachel	 Alright. So where\xc2\x92d you grow up?'
Joey	 That\xc2\x92s your move? Boy Rach, you\xc2\x92re lucky you\xc2\x92re hot.'
Rachel	 Come on, just answer the question!'
Joey	 (exasperated) Queens.'
Rachel	 And so were-were you close to your parents?'
Joey	 Yeah, with my mom. Yeah, not so much with my dad.'
Rachel	 Why not?'
Joey	 I don\xc2\x92t know. I guess there\xc2\x92s just always been this distance\r\r\ny\xc2\x92know\xc2\x97I mean we both try to pretend it\xc2\x92s not there, but it is.'
Rachel	 (sympathetic) Oh. (Starts rubbing his wrist with her fingers.) It\xc2\x92s\r\r\ngotta be rough.'
Joey	 Yeah, it is. It\xc2\x92s really tough. Y\xc2\x92know sometimes I\r\r\nthink\xc2\x97Wow!! Nice move!'
Rachel	 Huh?'
Joey	 "Where\xc2\x92d you grow up," it\xc2\x92s so simple!'
Rachel	 Thank you! And now if you\xc2\x92ll excuse me, I have to go to the rest\r\r\nroom.'
Joey	 Yeah.'
Rachel	 And now you\xc2\x92re watching me walk away.'
Joey	 Yes I am! Again so simple!'
Monica	 Hey.'
Chandler	 You are not going to believe what I did today!'
Monica	 Well it clearly wasn\xc2\x92t showering or shaving.'
Chandler	 I got good. I played this game all day and now I rule at it! They\r\r\nshould change the name of it to Ms. Chandler. (Pause) Although I-I hope they don\xc2\x92t.'
Monica	 Wait a minute, you stayed home all day and played Ms. Pac-Man\r\r\nwhile I went off to work like some kind of chump?!'
Chandler	 Uh-huh, and I got all the top ten scores, I erased Phoebe off the\r\r\nboard! High five! (Holds up his hand to give Monica a high five, only he can\xc2\x92t\r\r\nstraighten his fingers.)'
Monica	 What is the matter with your hand?'
Chandler	 Well I\xc2\x92ve been playing it for like eight hours, it\xc2\x92ll loosen\r\r\nup. Come on, check out the scores. Oh, and also look at the initials, they\xc2\x92re dirty\r\r\nwords.'
Monica	 Chandler, why would you do that?'
Chandler	 Because it\xc2\x92s awesome.'
Monica	 You think this is clever?'
Chandler	 Well y\xc2\x92know, they only give you three letters, so after A-S-S it\r\r\nis a bit of a challenge.'
Monica	 Hey wait a minute, this one isn\xc2\x92t dirty.'
Chandler	 It is when you put it together with that one.'
Monica	 Ah, well if you don\xc2\x92t clear this off, you won\xc2\x92t be getting one\r\r\nof those from me. But Ben\xc2\x92s coming over here tomorrow to play this game, this\r\r\ncan\xc2\x92t be there.'
Chandler	 Come on, he won\xc2\x92t even know what they mean.'
Monica	 Chandler! He\xc2\x92s seven; he\xc2\x92s not stupid.'
Chandler	 Have you talked to him lately?'
Monica	 All right, look I\xc2\x92m just gonna unplug it.'
Chandler	 No-no-no, if you unplug it, I\xc2\x92ll have nothing to show for my day!\r\r\nIt would be like I was at work. (She unplugs it.) No! (And plugs it back in.) Hey look at\r\r\nthat! Look at that, it\xc2\x92s still there! This thing must have some kind of primitive ROM\r\r\n(Read Only Memory, it\xc2\x92s a memory chip.) Chip in it or something!'
Monica	 Honey you-you got to beat your scores!'
Chandler	 With the claw?!'
Monica	 All right fine. Fine, I\xc2\x92ll do it. I\xc2\x92ve just got to get this\r\r\noff the screen. Carol and Susan are still upset that you taught him pull my finger.'
Chandler	 (smiles) Pull my finger\xc2\x97(Looks at his hand)\xc2\x97My hand is\r\r\nmessed up.'
Rachel	 I am not gonna answer that!'
Joey	 Oh come on! Just pick one! Between Monica, Phoebe, Chandler, and Ross if\r\r\nyou had to, if you had to, who would you punch?'
Rachel	 No one! They are my friends, I wouldn\xc2\x92t punch any of them.'
Joey	 Chandler?'
Rachel	 Yeah, but I don\xc2\x92t know why. Look at me, I\xc2\x92m having such a\r\r\nwonderful time!'
Joey	 Me too! Hey Rach, can I just say I think this is the best date I ever had!'
Rachel	 I know!'
Joey	 I never laughed so hard\xc2\x97Did you see the wine come out of my nose?'
Rachel	 Joey, I think everyone saw the wine come out of your nose.'
Joey	 I gotta say, I never knew I could enjoy the non-sex part of the date so\r\r\nmuch.'
Rachel	 Well that is because you have never been on a date with me before.'
Joey	 Huh. Huh.'
Rachel	 All right, now don\xc2\x92t judge me. I normally wait until my date\r\r\nleaves, but you live here. I\xc2\x92m ripping into this swan.'
Joey	 Ah! Okay, well then you don\xc2\x92t judge me. I\xc2\x92m gonna suck on the\r\r\ncellophane from the brownie I had before. (They both do as they planned.)'
Rachel	 So tell me, what are Joey Tribbiani\xc2\x92s end of the night moves?'
Joey	 Ah, well, if I want the girl to kiss me, first thing I do is make my lips\r\r\nlook irresistible. '
Rachel	 How do you do that?'
Joey	 Now you can\xc2\x92t tell anyone, but uh\xc2\x85I put on shiny lip balm.'
Rachel	 Oh my God!'
Joey	 Yeah, like a moth to a flame, I\xc2\x92m telling ya. Okay all right, so now\r\r\nyou go.'
Rachel	 No, I don\xc2\x92t want to tell you.'
Joey	 Why not?'
Rachel	 Because it\xc2\x92s embarrassing.'
Joey	 More embarrassing than shiny raspberry lip balm?! (Rachel just looks at\r\r\nhim.) I didn\xc2\x92t say raspberry before did I? All right just-just tell me Rach, just\r\r\ntell me!'
Rachel	 (laughs) Okay. All right, stand up. (They do so.) Well, when we\xc2\x92re\r\r\nat the door, I lightly press my lips against his, and then move into his body just for a\r\r\nsecond, and then I make this sound, "Hmmm." Okay, I know it doesn\xc2\x92t sound\r\r\nlike anything, but I swear it works.'
Joey	 (stunned and turned on) Yeah. Why\xc2\x97Yeah, that would work for ya\xc2\x85'
Rachel	 All right, I gotta go to bed. Honey, I had such a wonderful time.'
Joey	 Oh. (She kisses him.) Yeah. (She goes into her room.) Me to. (He then\r\r\nstarts to freak out.)'

Rachel	 \xc2\x85you were 50 minutes late to the class, what did you crawl there?!'
Ross	 No, I ran. It was really far, and when did people stop understanding the\r\r\nphrase, "Get the hell out of my way!"'
Rachel	 Well, why didn\xc2\x92t you just take a cab?'
Ross	 Ugh, between the traffic that time of day and all the one-way streets\r\r\nit\xc2\x92ll take me twice as long. Besides, I teach the class three times a week, who am I?\r\r\nRockefeller?'
Rachel	 Well you\xc2\x92re not gonna be able to keep doing this.'
Ross	 Well I have to. Okay? If I don\xc2\x92t, they\xc2\x92ll take the class away\r\r\nfrom me. And\xc2\x85I already put it in my family newsletter.'
Rachel	 You what?'
Ross	 You\xc2\x92ve seen it, the Geller Yeller.'
Rachel	 Right. Wow!'
Ross	 Besides, I-I think I figured out a much faster route, I\xc2\x92m sure I can\r\r\nmake it this time. I just\xc2\x85I just can\xc2\x92t be afraid to get a little bit\xc2\x85hit by\r\r\ncars. (He goes to the bathroom as Joey enters.)'
Joey	 Hey!'
Rachel	 Hi! Hey, remember how last night we were talking about that movie Cujo?\r\r\n'
Joey	 Oh yeah, I still can\xc2\x92t believe you haven\xc2\x92t seen Cujo.\r\r\nWhat is wrong with you?'
Rachel	 Relax! It\xc2\x92s not like it\xc2\x92s Citizen Kane!'
Joey	 Have you ever tried to sit through Citizen Kane?'
Rachel	 Yeah I know it\xc2\x92s really boring, but it\xc2\x92s like a big deal.\r\r\nAnyway, I was thinking about renting Cujo sometime.'
Joey	 Oh yeah? All right, let\xc2\x92s do it tonight.'
Rachel	 Well don\xc2\x92t you have that big date tonight?'
Joey	 Oh right!'
Rachel	 Hey Joey, can I ask you something?'
Joey	 Yeah.'
Rachel	 After our date last night, did you feel a little weird?'
Joey	 Oh my God! You did too? It totally freaked me out, what was that?!'
Rachel	 I don\xc2\x92t know! (Pause) I\xc2\x92m-I\xc2\x92m kinda thinking it-it was\r\r\nthe lobster\xc2\x85'
Joey	 Oh yeah-yeah, the lobster.'
Rachel	 Yeah, I mean I was up sick all night.'
Joey	 Yeah me too, all night.'
Rachel	 Really?! How come we didn\xc2\x92t cross paths?'
Joey	 Yeah well that\xc2\x92s because uh\xc2\x85I stayed in my room. Yeah, you\r\r\ndon\xc2\x92t want to look in my hamper.'
Monica	 Okay, I got that. I\xc2\x92ll escape over there. I\xc2\x92ll come back over\r\r\nhere. All right, come on Ms. Pac-Man. It\xc2\x92s got\xc2\x97Right\xc2\x97(She dies.)\r\r\nWell, you\xc2\x92re just a little bitch, aren\xc2\x92t you?'
Phoebe	 (entering) Hey, you guys. Listen, I\xc2\x92m sorry that I was hogging the\r\r\ngame before\xc2\x97(Sees the top ten list)\xc2\x97Oh my God! Your friends have some\r\r\nunfortunate initials!'
Monica	 They\xc2\x92re all Chandler.'
Phoebe	 Chandler sucks! He couldn\xc2\x92t have gotten this good!'
Chandler	 I did. (Looks at his still deformed hand) But it came at a price.'
Monica	 But Ben is coming over tonight and he can\xc2\x92t see this.'
Chandler	 Oh come on, by age seven kids have already seen orgies. (They both\r\r\nlook at him.) Was it just me?!'
Ross	 Yeah!!!! Yes, I made it! I\xc2\x92m on time! (Grabs a bottle of water from a\r\r\nstudent, takes a drink, and splashes some on his face like the marathon runners do.) Okay,\r\r\nwhy don\xc2\x92t we all uh, (Exhales loudly) open our books to page 23. Where\xc2\x85 (Exhales\r\r\nagain) Where you will see\xc2\x85a uh\xc2\x85a bunch of uh\xc2\x85red spots. Okay, (Closes his\r\r\nbook.) umm, why don\xc2\x92t, why don\xc2\x92t you all start to read, while I\xc2\x97(Passes out\r\r\nand collapses.)'
Joey's Date	 Hey. Are you all right? You seem a little distracted."
Joey	 No-no! I\xc2\x92m fine. It\xc2\x92s just\xc2\x85 Hey, can I ask you something?\r\r\nHave you ever looked at someone that you\xc2\x92ve known for a while and then\r\r\nsuddenly\xc2\x85suddenly see them a different way?'
Joey's Date	 You mean like from behind?"
Joey	 Yeah. Yeah, that\xc2\x85that\xc2\x92s exactly it. You\xc2\x92re right. Yeah.'
Joey's Date	 Ew, y\xc2\x92know what? One time I saw this guy from behind and he\r\r\nseemed like a totally normal guy and then he turned around and it was Stephan Baldwin!"
Joey	 (deadpan) Ooh! Yeah. So yeah, so you know exactly what I\xc2\x92m talking\r\r\nabout.'
Joey's Date	 Totally! Wow! (Pause) Would you excuse me for a sec?"
Joey	 Oh yeah, sure. (She gets up, walks towards the bathroom, and Joey watches\r\r\nher go.) Ehhh.'
Monica	 Oh my God Phoebe, you\xc2\x92re on fire!'
Phoebe	 I know!'
Chandler	 One more score to go! You can do it! (Touches her shoulder.)'
Phoebe	 Don\xc2\x92t touch me!!'
Monica	 Don\xc2\x92t touch her!!'
Chandler	 All right! Go left! Go left! Go right!! Go right!!'
Phoebe	 I can\xc2\x92t!! I can\xc2\x92t!! (She dies.) Noooooooo!!!!!!! You son of a\r\r\nbitch!!!!! '
Ross	 Phoebe!!'
Phoebe	 Oh hi Ben\xc2\x97No!! Don\xc2\x92t look at the machine! (Covers the screen.)'
Rachel	 Oh God! Thank God you\xc2\x92re home! I\xc2\x92m watching Cujo.'
Joey	 (incredulous) Alone?!'
Rachel	 Yes! But what is wrong with this dog?!'
Joey	 Hey, did you get to the part where they\xc2\x92re trapped in the car and\r\r\nCujo\xc2\x92s throwin\xc2\x92 himself at the windshield?'
Rachel	 No! No! Seriously, what\xc2\x92s wrong with the dog?! Wait a minute, what\r\r\nare you doing home so early? What happened to your date?'
Joey	 Oh uh, it didn\xc2\x92t work out.'
Rachel	 Oh. Do you want to watch the rest of the movie with me?'
Joey	 Oh uh, okay. Yeah.'
Rachel	 Y\xc2\x92know, I never thought I\xc2\x92d say this about a movie, but I\r\r\nreally hope this dog dies. (Joey brings over a stool at sits on it next to Rachel\r\r\nwho\xc2\x92s in the big chair.) What are you doing over there? Come sit here, you protect\r\r\nme.'
Joey	 Oh sure, yeah, why not? (Sits on the arm of the chair.)'
Rachel	 Okay. (Pushes play.) Okay, that\xc2\x92s him! That\xc2\x92s him! That\xc2\x92s\r\r\nCujo! That\xc2\x92s Cujo!'
Joey	 All right, I know! I know. Yeah, it\xc2\x92ll be okay.'
Rachel	 Oh my God\xc2\x85.What\xc2\x92s he gonna do now? I can\xc2\x92t watch! (Drags\r\r\nJoey closer to her and cowers into his chest.) Oh. Seriously, how can you watch this?\r\r\nAren\xc2\x92t you scared?'
Joey	 Terrified. (But for a totally different reason.)'

Ross	 So is everybody here? I got here a little early myself. Let us begin. Now,\r\r\nthe hydrosaurids have been unearthed in two main locations. (He moves to the map and we\r\r\nsee why he made it to class on time, he\xc2\x92s wearing in-line skates and hasn\xc2\x92t\r\r\ntaken them off.) Here. (Points to the map, somewhere in the Middle East, then spins on the\r\r\nskates and points to the map.) Here. (China.) Now as for the hydrosaurs\xc2\x85 '
