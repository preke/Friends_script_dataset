Phoebe	 ...sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle;and away they all flew like the down of a thistle; but I heard him exclaim, ere he drove out of sight, "Merry Christmas to all, and to all a goodnight!"'
Joey	 (impressed) Wow, that was great! You really wrote that?'
Phoebe	 (smiling) Uh-huh.'
Chandler	 (coming from the bedroom) Say goodbye elves, I'm off to Tulsa."
Monica	 I can't believe you're not gonna be here for Christmas."
Ross	 You're really not coming back?"
Chandler	 Yeah, we have all this paperwork that needs to be filed by the end of the year. If I don't get it done, I'll be fired."
Monica	 It's so unfair, you don't even like your job!"
Chandler	 So, who does?'
Phoebe	 Oh, I like my job.'
Joey	 I *love* my job.'
Rachel	 Yeah, I can't *wait* to go back to work."
Ross	 I can't get *enough* dinosaurs!"
Chandler	 I'm sorry, I won't be here."
Monica	 It's just... It's hard enough not seeing you during the week, but for Christmas... alright, if this is what you have to do, I understand."
Chandler	 Thanks. (they kiss) I'll see you New Year's Day."
Monica	 (shocked) You're not gonna be here New Year's Eve??"
Chandler	 Did I not mention that?'
Monica	 No!'
Chandler	 (thinks for a second, then waves his arms, exclaiming

Chandler	 All right everybody, I know that it\'s Christmas Eve and you\'d rather be with your families, but there\'s *no* call (he takes it off) for writing "Screw you, Mr. Bing!" on the back of my chair! (he looks at it) -- By the way, you can all call me Chandler.'
Wendy	 Hey!'
Others	 Hey.'
Chandler	 Hey. Where've you been?"
Wendy	 I was, uh, checking out that insurance company's Christmas party on three, oh, it was really beautiful, they have all these decorations and this huge tree and I just, uh... to hell with them, we have to work. -- So I stole ther ham. (She turns the cardboard box upside down over the conference table, a big piece of ham falls out.)"
Chandler	 (to the others) You hear that? You may not be with your families, but at least it's gonna smell like ham in here."
Claudia	 My kid's in a play right now."
Chandler	 Y'know what, I know what will cheer you guys up! (he starts spreading envelopes among them) I had a little talk with the boys in New York, told 'em about all the hard work you've been doing and that a little Christmas bonus may be in order."
Ken	 (reading off his card) "A donation has been made in your name to the New York City Ballet".'
Chandler	 Well, that's like money in your pocket! - Alright look, you want me to say it? This sucks. Being here sucks! This work sucks!"
Wendy	 *Now* it feels like Christmas.'
Chandler	 I'm sorry. Hey, at least you guys get to go home and be with your families tonight. I have to go back to an empty hotel room and lay down on a very questionable bedspread. And then tomorrow morning, you get to have Christmas morning in your own houses, wich, by the way, none of you have invited me to."
Ken	 You can come to my house!'
Chandler	 Haha, no thanks!'
Wendy	 That was a nice pep-talk.'
Chandler	 Oh, thanks! I'm... actually thinking about becoming a motivational speaker."
Wendy	 So, if you were home right now, what would you be doing?'
Chandler	 Typical Christmas-y stuff, you know? Our holidays are pretty traditional...'
Phoebe	 So here is a, a very special holiday song that I wrote for some very important people to me. (singing
Rachel	 Okay, Pheebs, you look in the kitchen, I will look in the back closet.'
Chandler	 I can save you time ladies, I'm right here."
Phoebe	 Yeah, Chandler why don't you take a walk? This doesn't concern you."
Rachel	 We are looking for our Christmas presents from Monica.'
Chandler	 What? That's terrible!"
Phoebe	 No-no, we do it every year!'
Chandler	 Oh well, that, that makes it not terrible.'
Phoebe	 No, yeah, we never find them! She's always best at us, that wily... minx."
Rachel	 Don't worry, we're just gonna search here for an hour, and then we're gonna go over to Joey's and search, OK?"
Chandler	 No not okay, you can't look for Monica's presents!"
Phoebe	 Oh no, we have to!'
Chandler	 No, you don't have to, and you can't because I, I live here too."
Phoebe	 Well then, you should look with us.'
Chandler	 Why?'
Rachel	 Chandler, aren't you worried about what to get Monica for Christmas?"
Chandler	 No, I have a great idea for a present for her.'
Phoebe	 Oh, that's it? (Mimics Chandler) A great idea! Oh yeah."
Rachel	 Chandler, that's not enough. I mean what if she gets you a great present, two medium presents, and a bunch of little presents? And you've just gotten her one great present? I mean that's just gonna make her feel bad. Why would you do that to her Chandler? Why? Why?"
Chandler	 If I help, we can find 'em faster!"
Rachel	 That's right!"
Phoebe	 Ooh ooh, we have a live one!'
Rachel	 Oh, it's a Macy's bag!"
Rachel	 Oh.'
Phoebe	 Ooh, who's it for?"
Rachel	 (Reading from a tag that\'s attached to the shoe) "Dear losers, do you really think I\'d hide presents under the couch? P.S.
Joey	 Rach, these are for you.'
Rachel	 Wiper blades. I don't even have a car."
Joey	 No, but with this new car smell, you'll think you do."
Chandler	 OK, Pheebs, your turn.'
Phoebe	 Ahh, toilet seat covers! Is that what you were doing while I was getting gas?'
Joey	 Uh-huh.'
Phoebe	 You guuuyys.'
Joey	 And for Ross, Mr. Sweet-tooth.'
Ross	 You got me a cola drink?'
Chandler	 And, a lemon lime.'
Ross	 Well this, this is too much, I feel like I should get you another sweater.'
Chandler	 And last but not least.'
Joey	 They're ribbed for *your* pleasure."
Ross	 Ooh, hey Ben, what if the Holiday Armadillo told you all about the Festival of Lights?'
Ross	 Yeah!'
Monica	 Come on Ben.'
Ross	 Years and years ago there were these people called the Maccabees...'
Chandler	 (entering in a Santa costume) Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas!'
Chandler	 Hey! (Grunts as Ben hits him at full speed.)'
Ross	 What are you doing here, Santa?'
Chandler	 Well, I'm here to see my old buddy Ben. What are you doing here, weird...turtle-man?"
Ross	 I'm the Holiday Armadillo, your part-Jewish friend. You sent me here to give Ben some presents. Remember?"
Chandler	 What?'
Monica	 Okay Ben, why don't you come open some more presents, and Santa, the Armadillo and I have a little talk in the kitchen? There's a sentence I'd never thought I'd say."
Ross	 (to Chandler) What are you doing?'
Chandler	 You called everyone and said you were having trouble finding a Santa costume, so I borrowed one from a guy at work!'
Ross	 Thank you, but, but you, you gotta leave.'
Chandler	 Why?'
Ross	 Because, I'm finally getting him excited about Hanukkah, and, and you're-you're wrecking it."
Chandler	 But I didn't get to shake my belly like a bowl full of jelly."
Ross	 I'm sorry Chandler, but this, this is really important to me."
Chandler	 Fine, I'll give the suit back."
Monica	 (to Chandler) Hey, you think, you can keep it another night? (She has a really teasing look on her face and keeps twirling Chandler's beard.)"
Chandler	 Santa? Really?'
Monica	 Yeah, is that okay?'
Chandler	 Did your Dad ever dress up like Santa?'
Monica	 No.'
Chandler	 Then it's okaaay! (They kiss.)"
Chandler	 You know what, everybody? Go home. You should be with your families. It's bad enough that we're working New Year's Eve."
Chandler	 Did I not tell *anyone* about New Year's Eve? -- Alright, look, go! Go home, okay? Merry Christmas! Go."
Chandler	 Good, God's speed, good people! (he starts to close the door, turns around and sees Wendy) You're not gonna go?"
Wendy	 Naah... I couldn't leave you alone."
Chandler	 Ah. Thanks.'
Wendy	 Besides, I can't leave until their Christmas party downstairs clears out; there are some *pissed off* insurance people looking for that ham."
Chandler	 Ah. (The phone rings; he answers it) Chandler Bing.'
Monica	 Hi Honey! We're all here; we just want to wish you a Merry Christmas."
Others	 (simultaneously) Merry Christmas! (except for Phoebe...)'
Phoebe	 (simultaneous to the others) Ble-blah-blar Blargh!'
Chandler	 Ahh, Merry Christmas; I miss you guys!'
Monica	 So is it horrible? Is everybody working really hard?'
Chandler	 Ah, well no, it's just uh, me and Wendy."
Monica	 Wendy? -- That sounds like a girl's name."
Chandler	 It is. Did I... not tell you about her?'
Monica	 Umhmm, umhmm, about the time you told me about New Year's Eve. Where is everybody else?"
Chandler	 I sent them home.'
Monica	 Ohh, you are such a good boss! Is she pretty?'
Chandler	 Uhh, uh...'
Ross	 (in a low voice) Answer faster, answer faster!'
Chandler	 I don't know!"
Ross	 (in the same low voice) Answer better, answer better!'
Chandler	 I don't think of her that way, you know, she's a, she's a colleague."
Monica	 What does she do there?'
Chandler	 Oh, she's regional Vice President; She's... just below me."
Monica	 She did WHAT?'
Chandler	 BE-LOW me!'
Joey	 Ahh, wait, is Wendy the runner-up Miss Oklahoma?'
Monica	 *What*??'
Chandler	 Well, she... she didn't win..."
Monica	 Alright, well, maybe I should let you and the second prettiest girl in Oklahoma get back to work.'
Chandler	 Well, second prettiest that year; I mean, of *all* the girls in Oklahoma, she's probably..."
Rachel	 (interrupting him) Oh Chandler, stop talking!'
Chandler	 Honey, there's really nothing to worry about."
Monica	 Okay.'
Chandler	 I'm serious!"
Monica	 Okay!'
Chandler	 Merry Christmas.'
Monica	 Merry Christmas.'
Chandler	 Merry Christmas, you guys!'
Others	 (simultaneously) Yeah, Merry... Christmas. (again, Phoebe...)'
Phoebe	 (simultaneous to the others) Blah blargah, blar-blab.'
Chandler	 (hanging up the phone) The wife says "Hi!".'
Wendy	 Ah. Fun conversation?'
Chandler	 Ah well, she's got this weird idea, that, uh, y'know, just because you and I are alone, that something is gonna happen."
Wendy	 Huh? Really? -- Hm, that'd be so terrible? (She gets hold of Chandler's tie, slowly moving her hands upwards on the tie, getting closer and closer to him, seductive.)"
Chandler	 This is probably the wrong thing to be worrying about, but... you're getting ham on my only tie."
Chandler	 Whoa-ho, back off, Missy! (He takes a step back, but she still keeps her grip on his tie.)'
Wendy	 (laughs) ...Missy?'
Chandler	 I don't know; I'm not used to girls making passes at me! ... (She lets go of his tie) Wait a minute... am I sexy in Oklahoma?"
Wendy	 You are to me... (She gets closer again, putting her arms around his torso.)'
Chandler	 (flattered) No,... no... (realizing) NO! (He quickly gets several steps away from her.) Look, I'm, I'm married!"
Wendy	 So? I'm married. (Showing him the ring on her finger.)"
Chandler	 I'm *happily* married."
Wendy	 Oh. - What's *that* like?"
Chandler	 Right. So, I'm sorry..."
Wendy	 Seriously? Happily married. So that phone call before, that was ... happy?'
Chandler	 Well look, it's not easy to spend this much time apart, you know. She's entitled to be a little paranoid... or, in this case
Wendy	 Okay, let me ask you something
Chandler	 I mean, you were the most beautiful woman in the room tonight!'
Monica	 Really?'
Chandler	 You kidding? You're the most beautiful woman in most rooms... (She jumps up and kisses him.) (Breaking the kiss.) Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What's going on? You and I just made out! You and I are making out?"
Monica	 Well, not anymore.'
Chandler	 But we don't do that."
Monica	 I know, I just thought it would be fun.'
Chandler	 How drunk are you?'
Monica	 Drunk enough that I know I wanna do this. Not so drunk that you should feel guilty about taking advantage.'
Chandler	 (thinks) That's the perfect amount!"
Monica	 Okay!'
Monica	 (breaking the kiss) Y'know what's weird?"
Chandler	 What?'
Monica	 This doesn't feel weird!"
Chandler	 I know.'
Monica	 You're a really good kisser."
Chandler	 Well, I have kissed over four women. (They kiss again.) Do you wanna get under the covers?'
Monica	 Hm-hmm!'
Chandler	 Okay!'
Monica	 Wow! You are really fast!'
Chandler	 It bodes well for me that speed impresses you.'
Monica	 We're gonna see each other naked."
Chandler	 Yep!'
Monica	 Do you wanna do it at the same time?'
Chandler	 Count of three?'
Monica	 One!'
Chandler	 Two!'
Monica	 Two!'
Both	 Three! (They lift up the covers and check each other out, then come back up with silly grins on their faces.)'
Chandler	 Well I think it's safe to say that our friendship is effectively ruined."
Monica	 Eh, we weren't that close anyway!"
Chandler	 Eh! (They start making out again)'
Chandler	 So, are you really gonna go out with that nurse man?'
Monica	 Well uh, you and I are just goofing around, I thought, why not just goof around with him.'
Chandler	 Y'know, I don't know if you've ever looked up the term goofing around in the dictionary... Well, I have, and the technical definition is, two friends who care a lot about each other and have amazing sex and just wanna spend more time together. But if you have this new fangled dictionary that gets you made at me, then we have to, y'know, get you my original dictionary. I am *so* bad at this."
Monica	 I think you're better than you think you are."
Chandler	 Really? Okay, so...'
Monica	 (interrupting) Know when to stop.'
Chandler	 Y'know, I sensed that I should stop. So we're okay?"
Monica	 Yeah. (They kiss and as she starts to leave, Chandler starts to dance. Without turning around
Chandler	 Right!'
Monica	 I can't get married until I get something old, something new, something borrowed, and something blue."
Chandler	 Okay, all right, all right, all right! Okay! (Picks up a blue sweater.) Okay, here's something, here's something blue and new."
Monica	 You're so efficient. I love you!"
Chandler	 Let's go! (Starts to leave.)"
Monica	 No-no-no, wait! We need something old!'
Chandler	 Oh, okay, I have condom in my wallet that I've had since I was twelve."
Monica	 That'll work!"
Chandler	 I don't think so."
Monica	 Okay, now we just need something borrowed!'
Chandler	 (looks around) Here just...take this. (Hands her the sweater.)'
Monica	 That's stealing!"
Chandler	 No, we'll-we'll bring it back! Just put it under your dress."
Monica	 Ohh. (Rubs her fake stomach.)'
Chandler	 Okay, one thing at a time. (They run out to get married.)'
Monica	 Listen umm, I've been thinking, it's not fair for me to ask you to spend all of your money on our wedding. I mean, you work, you work really hard for that."
Chandler	 Ehh.'
Monica	 Eh, you work for that.'
Chandler	 Look, I thought about it too, and I'm sorry. I think we should spend all of the money on the wedding."
Monica	 You do?!'
Chandler	 Yeah, I'm putting my foot down. Yeah look, when I proposed I told you that I would do anything to make you happy, and if having the perfect wedding makes you happy, then, then that's what we're gonna do."
Monica	 Oh, you're so sweet. (They hug and kiss.) Oh, but wait, what about our, what about the future and stuff?"
Chandler	 Eh, forget about the future and stuff! So we only have two kids, y'know? We'll pick our favorite and that one will get to go to college."
Monica	 You thought about that?'
Chandler	 Yeah.'
Monica	 How many kids were we gonna have?'
Chandler	 Uh, four, a boy, twin girls and another boy.'
Monica	 What else did you think about?'
Chandler	 Well, stuff like where we'd live, y'know? Like a small place outside the city, where our kids could learn to ride their bikes and stuff. Y'know, we could have a cat that had a bell on its collar and we could hear it every time it ran through the little kitty door. Of course, we'd have an apartment over the garage where Joey could grow old."
Monica	 (laughs) Y'know what? I-I don't want a big, fancy wedding."
Chandler	 Sure you do.'
Monica	 No, I want everything that you just said. I want a marriage.'
Chandler	 You sure?'
Monica	 Uh-hmm.'
Chandler	 I love you so much.'
Monica	 I love you. (They kiss.)'
Rachel	 (opens her present from Ross; it's a dark-red scarf) Oohh, I love it!"
Ross	 Really? You're not gonna return it?"
Rachel	 Well, not this second!'
Phoebe	 (at the window) Hey look, you guys, it's snowing!"
Rachel	 Oh wow, it's so beautiful..."
Ross	 Wow, it really is!'
Monica	 "Wendy" is a fat girl name.'
Phoebe	 Aren't we done with that?"
Monica	 Okay, fine. Let's talk about snow. -- Do you think it's snowing in Tulsa, where my husband is having sex on a copying machine?"
Chandler	 Hey!'
Ross	 Oh my god...'
Joey	 Hey-heeyyy - Look at that, it's a Christmas miracle!"
Monica	 What are you doing here?'
Chandler	 I wanted to be with you. I missed you so much.'
Joey	 Hey, hey, uh, who did you miss the most?'
Chandler	 Monica.'
Joey	 Got ya. (blinks an eye)'
Chandler	 I never want to leave you again!'
Monica	 But I thought if you left, you get fired.'
Chandler	 Turns out they can't fire me. Because I quit."
Monica	 What?'
Ross	 What, you, you really quit your job?'
Chandler	 Yeah! It's a stupid job, and I could not stand leaving you. And why should I be the only one who doesn't get to do what he *really* wants to do?"
Rachel	 What do you really want to do?'
Chandler	 (realizing) I have *not* thought this through!'
Monica	 Oh my god!'
Chandler	 I know, I, I should have talked to you first about it.'
Monica	 No, I think that this is what you wanna do, I think it's great!"
Chandler	 Thanks!'
Phoebe	 Chandler, your being here is the best Christmas present I could have ever imagined.'
Chandler	 (flattered) Ahh...'
Phoebe	 Now give me my real gift.'
Phoebe	 (to Chandler) Thank you.'
Chandler	 (to Monica) Here, pass these, will ya.. (points to the others)'
Ross	 Oh, hey...'
Ross	 (reading off his card) "A donation has been made in your name to the New York City Ballet." -- How did you know?'
Rachel	 Wha... are you kidding? I can't return this."
Chandler	 I... thought it was a timely start to thinking about other people. Besides, this gift still says I love you guys.'
Joey	 Mine's is to Lilian Myers."
Chandler	 I don't have a *job*!"

Chandler	 Actuary... no. Book-keeper... no. Topless dancer... (he looks down on himself, checking, then nods satisfied and marks the offer with a pen) (to Monica
Monica	 You are! (she picks up a bill from the table, handing it to Chandler) Hey, here's twenty bucks. -- Why don't you go buy yourself something pretty while I'm at work tomorrow?"
