Monica	 Hey.'
Chandler	 Hey.'
Monica	 Oh my God! You cleaned! (Gasps) Look at these floors! You did the\nwindows! Oh, I have been begging you for months and you did! You cleaned! And nagging\nworks!'
Chandler	 Y\xc2\x92know uh, I didn\xc2\x92t actually do this.'
Monica	 Oh no, was I cleaning in my sleep again?'
Chandler	 No, it wasn\xc2\x92t you.'
Monica	 Well then who?'
Chandler	 I got a maid. Yay!'
Monica	 (shocked) I hope by maid you mean mistress, because if some other woman\nwas here cleaning then\xc2\x85'
Chandler	 Uh honey, I know you don\xc2\x92t like to relinquish control\xc2\x85'
Monica	 Oh, relinquish is just a fancy word for lose!'
Chandler	 Look, she\xc2\x92s really nice. Okay? And she mentioned that she adored\nthe way that you arranged the sponges.'
Monica	 Did she really say that?'
Chandler	 Yes, I distinctly remember \xc2\x91cause I thought it was a joke. Now\njust give her a chance, okay?'
Monica	 Fine, I can do it. (Gets anxious.) Whew.'
Chandler	 What\xc2\x92s the matter?'
Monica	 Well, usually when I\xc2\x92m this anxious, I clean!'

Phoebe	 (looking around) Who\xc2\x92s cell phone is that? It\xc2\x92s just so\nannoying; everywhere you go.'
Ross	 I think it\xc2\x92s coming from your bag.'
Phoebe	 (checks) I never get calls!! (Answers the phone) Hello?'
Eric	 Hi, it\xc2\x92s Eric. From the Halloween party, Ursula\xc2\x92s fianc\xc3\xa9e. '
Phoebe	 Oh my God Eric hi! Wait, how\xc2\x92d you get this number?'
Eric	 Oh, I have a friend who\xc2\x92s a cop and he got it for me.'
Phoebe	 Wow! What an incredible violation\xc2\x97and wonderful surprise.'
Eric	 Uh listen, I just\xc2\x97I thought you should know I broke up with Ursula.'
Phoebe	 Oh you did? (To Rachel) He did it! He did it!'
Rachel	 Wow! What did he do?'
Phoebe	 Shhh! I\xc2\x92m talking.'
Eric	 Anyway, I was wondering if, you were the sort of person who\xc2\x85eats\nlunch.'
Phoebe	 Are you asking me out? \xc2\x91Cause it would be kinda weird since you\njust broke up with my sister.'
Eric	 Yeah uh\xc2\x85okay. I\xc2\x92m-I\xc2\x92m sorry. Bye.'
Phoebe	 No! Wait! I was just saying that so you\xc2\x92d think I was a good\nperson. Fight for me.'
Eric	 Uhh, I won\xc2\x92t take no for an answer.'
Phoebe	 Not great, but we can work on it at lunch. Okay, I can be at your\napartment in two hours.'
Eric	 Great! But wh-wh\xc2\x97How do you know where I live?'
Phoebe	 I\xc2\x92ve got friends too. Okay, bye.'
Eric	 Bye.'
Phoebe	 Oh my God! I\xc2\x92m going out with Eric! Ooh, this day is really gonna\nbe so much better than I thought it was gonna be. Oh Ross, I can\xc2\x92t make lunch.\n(Exits.)'
Ross	 So apparently I\xc2\x92m available for lunch.'
Rachel	 I can\xc2\x92t. I\xc2\x92m busy. I\xc2\x92m apartment hunting.'
Ross	 You\xc2\x92re moving?'
Rachel	 Yeah, I can\xc2\x92t live with Joey once the baby comes. I don\xc2\x92t want\nmy child\xc2\x92s first words to be, (in a baby\xc2\x92s voice) "How you\ndoin\xc2\x92?"'
Ross	 So does-does Joey know you\xc2\x92re moving?'
Rachel	 Well, I haven\xc2\x92t discussed it with him yet, but I know he\xc2\x92s\ngonna be relieved. Last week, he brought this girl over and I started talking to her about\nmorning sickness and then I showed her pictures from my pregnancy book.'
Ross	 That\xc2\x92s not really porn.'
Rachel	 Not so much.'
Ross	 Hey, y\xc2\x92know what and if you\xc2\x92re looking for a place? I just heard\nin the elevator this morning that a woman in my building died.'
Rachel	 Oh my God! Was she old? Does she have a view?'
Ross	 Well I don\xc2\x92t know, but how-how great would that be huh? You living in\nmy building. I could help take care of the baby. I can come over whenever I want. (Rachel\nlooks at him.) With your permission.'
Rachel	 Yeah that would really be great.'
Ross	 Yeah.'
Rachel	 Well can we see it?! Oh maybe we shouldn\xc2\x92t. I mean if she just died\nthis morning out of respect.'
Ross	 Yeah. No. No you\xc2\x92re right. '
Rachel	 Shall we?'
Ross	 Yeah.'
Mrs. Verhoeven's Daughter	 Yes?"
Ross	 Hi. I\xc2\x92m Ross Geller. I live in the building.'
Rachel	 And I\xc2\x92m Rachel, an admirer of the building.'
Ross	 I-I heard about Mrs. Verhoeven passing away and I\xc2\x92m so sorry for your\nloss.'
Mrs. Verhoeven's Daughter	 She didn\xc2\x92t pass."
Ross	 What?'
Mrs. Verhoeven's Daughter	 My mother\xc2\x92s still alive."
Ross	 Oh, thank God!'
Mrs. Verhoeven's Daughter	 It looked like we were gonna lose her this morning,\nbut she\xc2\x92s a tough old bird."
Rachel	 Ahh.'
Mrs. Verhoeven's Daughter	 Are you close with her?"
Ross	 Of course! Uh yeah, she and I would talk all the time in-in (Rachel pokes\nher head in and starts to look around) the laundry room. (Pushes Rachel out of the way.)'
Mrs. Verhoeven's Daughter	 You speak Dutch? (In Dutch) Zeer vereerd een vriend\nvan mijn moeder te ontmoeten. (Translation
Ross	 Y\xc2\x92know I would it\xc2\x92s just painful.'
Rachel	 So she\xc2\x92s really not dead.'
Mrs. Verhoeven's Daughter	 No, she\xc2\x92s hanging in there."
Rachel	 Hmm. Do you think\xc2\x97Could you tell me if she\xc2\x92s hanging in, in a\none bedroom or a two?'
Brenda	 Mrs. Bing, this tile cleaner is incredible! Where\xc2\x92d you get it?'
Monica	 Oh well umm, I make it myself! It\xc2\x92s two parts ammonia and one part\nlemon juice. And now the secret ingredient is\xc2\x85y\xc2\x92know what? We just met.'
Brenda	 Okay. Uhh, I\xc2\x92m gonna go get the clothes from the laundry room now.\nAnd, when I come back I\xc2\x92ll clean behind the refrigerator.'
Monica	 (To Chandler) I love her.'
Brenda	 I\xc2\x92ll be back in a minute.'
Monica	 Okay. (As Brenda exits Monica notices something.)'
Chandler	 See? I told you.'
Monica	 She stole my jeans!'
Chandler	 (pause) What?'
Monica	 I have been looking for them all week and she is wearing them!'
Chandler	 So she stole your pants and then she came back and wore them in front\nof you?'
Monica	 Don\xc2\x92t you see? It\xc2\x92s the perfect crime!'
Chandler	 She must\xc2\x92ve been planning this for years!'
Monica	 I will prove it to you! Okay? About a week ago I was wearing those jeans\nand I dropped a pen in my lap and it left an ink stain on the crotch. Now when she comes\nback I will find it and show you that stain!'
Chandler	 Honey, isn\xc2\x92t it possible that the company that sold the jeans\nmade more than just the one pair?'
Monica	 I guess.'
Chandler	 So, shouldn\xc2\x92t we go give her the benefit of the doubt before we\ngo\xc2\x85snooping around her crotch?'
Monica	 Fine. I\xc2\x92m just glad I didn\xc2\x92t give her my secret ingredient.'
Chandler	 Out of curiosity, what is your secret ingredient?'
Monica	 Yeah! (Laughs.)'
Phoebe	 Hi!'
Eric	 Come in, I\xc2\x92m so glad you\xc2\x92re here.'
Phoebe	 Yeah, me too. Not in the shaky angry way you are though.'
Eric	 Sorry, I just saw Ursula. I had to give the engagement ring back.'
Phoebe	 Oh.'
Eric	 Just seeing her brought it all back. All the lies, the way she used me. I\njust\xc2\x85I got so angry just looking at her\xc2\x85(Looks at Phoebe)\xc2\x85face.'
Phoebe	 Yeah. (Covers her face with her hand.) Yeah.'
Eric	 I\xc2\x92m sorry. I just\xc2\x85when I look at you I see her. When I see her I\nget a little bit angry.'
Phoebe	 Maybe this is too weird.'
Eric	 No wait! There\xc2\x92s only a problem when I look at you. (Sits down on the\ncouch.) Oh I got it! I got it. (Puts his hands to his eyes.)'
Phoebe	 No don\xc2\x92t tear out your eyes!!'
Eric	 I was just, I was just gonna take out my lenses.'
Phoebe	 Oh, yeah try that. (He finishes and looks at her.) So, is that better?'
Eric	 Not really. You\xc2\x85you\xc2\x92re blurry, but you still look like Ursula.\nYou\xc2\x92re Blursula. Okay wait. Maybe\xc2\x85If I-if I just don\xc2\x92t look at you for a\nwhile. (Stands up and turns his back to her.) See? It\xc2\x85it works. I\xc2\x92m not,\nI\xc2\x92m not angry at all anymore! This is a great date!'
Phoebe	 Look Eric, turn around. (He does so.) Look, I like you, but it\nshouldn\xc2\x92t be this hard. Y\xc2\x92know? This is our first date y\xc2\x92know? First\ndates are supposed to be about excitement and electricity and \xc2\x91Ooh, he just touched\nmy hand, did he mean to touch my hand?\xc2\x92 and y\xc2\x92know first kisses and\xc2\x85(He\nkisses her)\xc2\x85second kisses. (Motions for him to kiss her again which he does and they\nstart to make out.)'
Ross	 Thanks for the coffee, or bedankt voor de koffie, Gunter. (He translates\nthat phrase into Dutch.)'
Gunther	 Jij spreekt Nederlands? Dat is te gek. Heb je familie daar?\n(Translation
Ross	 Yeah, we\xc2\x92re done.'
Gunther	 Ezel. (Translation
Ross	 Ezel? Ezel? Ezel? (Looks it up in his book.)'
Joey	 (entering) Hey Ross! Listen, do you want to go see that new Imax movie on\ntide pools?'
Ross	 Really?!'
Joey	 (laughs) No. But I got Knicks tickets for you, me, and Chandler.'
Ross	 Sweet!'
Joey	 All right, well finish your coffee; let\xc2\x92s go.'
Ross	 Okay I-I just have to stop by my place first.'
Joey	 To tape the game? You do this every time Ross, you\xc2\x92re not\ngonna be on TV!'
Ross	 No-no, I-I have to see if this apartment became available.'
Joey	 Oh, you\xc2\x92re switching apartments?'
Ross	 It\xc2\x92s not for me, it\xc2\x92s for Rachel.'
Joey	 But Rachel has an apartment.'
Ross	 Yeah, but when the baby comes she\xc2\x92s gonna want to move.'
Joey	 She is?'
Ross	 Yeah, you didn\xc2\x92t expect her to live there with a baby did you?'
Joey	 I guess I didn\xc2\x92t really think about it.'
Ross	 (finds the word in the book) Ezel! (Reads the translation.) Hey Gunther!\nYou\xc2\x92re an ezel!'
Gunther	\xc2\xa0 Jij hebt seks met ezels. (Translation
Ross	 Damnit!'
Monica	 Nice jeans!'
Brenda	 Oh thanks! I like your top.'
Monica	 Oh. (Holds on to it.) (To herself) You\xc2\x92re not gettin\xc2\x92 it.'
Brenda	 What happened?!'
Monica	 Oh, I fell asleep.'
Brenda	 I was thinking about taking my lunch break.'
Monica	 Oh, will you do the top of the cabinets? That\xc2\x92ll really work up\nyour appetite for lunch.'
Brenda	 All right.'
Monica	 Hello.'
Brenda	 What\xc2\x92s going on?!'
Monica	 I\xc2\x92m sorry. I\xc2\x92ve never had a maid before, is this not okay?'

Rachel	 Hey!'
Joey	 Hey!'
Rachel	 How was the game?'
Joey	 Oh, okay. I\xc2\x85I ate way too much.'
Rachel	 Oh.'
Joey	 Ooh. (Notices the pizza, grabs a slice, and takes a bite.) So umm, I was\ntalkin\xc2\x92 to Ross and he said you were looking for a new place.'
Rachel	 Oh yeah! Hopefully across the street if certain Dutch people would just\nlet go.'
Joey	 I was kinda hoping you\xc2\x92d stay.'
Rachel	 Oh but Joey, I have to go. There\xc2\x92s no room for a baby here.'
Joey	 No room? It\xc2\x92s a baby. It\xc2\x92s like this big. (Holds his hands about\na foot apart.) Y\xc2\x92know, I mean you-you could you could put it over here. (A desk.)\nOr-or-or we could put it right here. (The chair.) Aw, it\xc2\x92s cute, right? Or-or we\ncould put it over here. (By the bathroom door.) You wouldn\xc2\x92t even notice it.\nWhere\xc2\x92s the baby? (Mumbles that it\xc2\x92s over in the corner.)'
Rachel	 Honey, it\xc2\x92s not just a matter of where you put it. I mean a baby\nchanges everything. They cry all the time. I mean imagine bringing home some girl and\ntrying to score when there\xc2\x92s a screaming baby around.'
Joey	 I could use a challenge! It\xc2\x92s getting pretty easy.'
Rachel	 Honey, it\xc2\x92s so sweet that you want me to stay, but I-I can\xc2\x92t\ndo that to you. I mean it would disrupt your entire life.'
Joey	 I love living with you so much. I just wish things didn\xc2\x92t have to\nchange.'
Rachel	 I know.'
Joey	 Y\xc2\x92know I blame Ross for this.'
Rachel	 I do too a little bit.'
Joey	 I\xc2\x92m gonna miss you, you\xc2\x92re the hottest roommate I ever had.'
Phoebe	 Ooh, oh no! I have to go! I have a massage appointment.'
Eric	 Oh no, stay here we\xc2\x92ll keep doing this. I\xc2\x92ll pay you.'
Phoebe	 No, I got in trouble for that before. I\xc2\x92ll see you later.'
Eric	 Absolutely. (They kiss and Phoebe heads for the door.) I love the way you\nkiss.'
Phoebe	 Really? That\xc2\x92s the thing I\xc2\x92m worse at! You\xc2\x92ll see.\n(Exits.)'
Chandler	 (entering) Hi!'
Monica	 Hey! Umm, I think Brenda needs a raise.'
Chandler	 How come?'
Monica	 Because I put my head between her legs.'
Chandler	 To see her pants?'
Monica	 They\xc2\x92re my pants!'
Chandler	 Are you sure? Did you see the stain?'
Monica	 No! I was just getting into position and then everything went dark.'
Chandler	 God! She is not stealing from us! Okay, will you let this go?'
Monica	 Fine. (Brenda comes in to use the bathroom and adjusts her pink bra\nstrap on the way.) She\xc2\x92s wearing my bra!'
Chandler	 Oh dear God!'
Monica	 My pink flowered bra! I recognize the strap!'
Chandler	 And yet you don\xc2\x92t recognize that you\xc2\x92re crazy.'
Monica	 Here\xc2\x92s the plan! Okay? I\xc2\x92m going to leave you get a look at\nBrenda\xc2\x92s bra!'
Chandler	 Here\xc2\x92s another plan\xc2\x85No!'
Monica	 I would do it but she thinks I\xc2\x92m attracted to her!'
Chandler	 Why?'
Monica	 Did you not hear where my head was? Come on! Come on we\xc2\x92re a\nteam! We\xc2\x92re in this together!'
Chandler	 I fear a jury will see it the same way!'
Monica	 Do this for me! Come on, I catch you looking at woman\xc2\x92s breasts all\nthe time!'
Chandler	 You see that?'
Monica	 Do you see this? (Mimics him drooling over a woman\xc2\x92s breasts.)'
Chandler	 All right. Yes. Okay. I get your point. But if it\xc2\x92s not your bra\nwill you just let the woman clean the apartment?!'
Monica	 Yes! Absolutely. Okay? Look, you\xc2\x92ll know it\xc2\x92s mine because on\nthe right cup, the lacey part, there\xc2\x92s a very noticeable rip.'
Chandler	 You need new clothes.'
Ross	 Hi. How is she?'
Mrs. Verhoeven's Daughter	 It\xc2\x92s not looking good."
Ross	 (happily) Oh. (Realizes then sadly) Oh. Well I uh, I brought her some\nbloemen. (Flowers in Dutch.)'
Mrs. Verhoeven's Daughter	 That\xc2\x92s so sweet. (Takes the flowers.) Would you\nlike to come in and say good-bye? I\xc2\x92m sure it would mean a lot to her."
Ross	 Oh I don\xc2\x92t know that it would.'
Mrs. Verhoeven's Daughter	 Well, her memory is pretty much gone."
Ross	 All right then. (Follows her in and checks the place out.)'
Phoebe	 (entering) Hey!'
Eric	 Welcome back!'
Phoebe	 Hey! (Jumps on the bed with him.) Can we pick up where we left off?'
Eric	 I don\xc2\x92t know, I\xc2\x92m still pretty tired out from this afternoon.'
Phoebe	 Why?'
Eric	 Uh, the sex.'
Phoebe	 What sex?'
Eric	 Our sex.'
Phoebe	 We didn\xc2\x92t have sex.'
Eric	 Well if I didn\xc2\x92t have sex with you, I had sex with someone that\nlooked an awful lot like\xc2\x85'
Phoebe	 (simultaneously as Eric) Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew!'
Eric	 (simultaneously as Phoebe) Oh no! Oh no! Oh no! Oh no! No! No! No!'
Phoebe	 You-you\xc2\x85you had sex with Ursula?!'
Eric	 Uh, a little bit. She-she-she walked in and I thought she was you and I\nkissed her and\xc2\x85'
Phoebe	 You didn\xc2\x92t notice she was wearing different clothes?!'
Eric	 Well I was just so excited to see you.'
Phoebe	 Oh. Ew! Ew! Ew! Ugh! Y\xc2\x92know what? This is too weird.'
Eric	 No-no it\xc2\x92s not! I don\xc2\x92t want to lose you! It\xc2\x92s-it\xc2\x92s\nlike I was saying to Ursula when I was making love to her and I thought she was\nyou\xc2\x97Yeah it is too weird.'
Phoebe	 So I guess this is it.'
Eric	 Yeah. (They hug.) Maybe it\xc2\x92s for the best. You smell just like her.'
Phoebe	 Yeah, so do you.'
Brenda	 (noticing him) What are you doing?'
Chandler	 I\xc2\x92m leaning. This is where I lean.'
Brenda	 Okay. (Goes over and fluffs up the pillows on the couch.'
Chandler	 Brenda a bee!'
Brenda	 What?'
Chandler	 Yes! It\xc2\x92s flown into your blouse and you\xc2\x92d better undo your\nbuttons lest it sting you!'
Brenda	 I think I know what\xc2\x92s going on here.'
Chandler	 You do?'
Brenda	 Look, I know it must be hard that your wife is a lesbian, but it\xc2\x92s\nwrong. You\xc2\x92re married.'
Chandler	 I totally understand. (They both laugh.) Can I just see your\nbra?'
Rachel	 Hi!'
Monica	 (looking at Rachel\xc2\x92s jeans) Where did you get those jeans?!'
Rachel	 You gave them to me!'
Monica	 No I didn\xc2\x92t!'
Rachel	 All right, I took them. But I figured it would be okay because you got a\nbig ink stain on the crotch.'
Monica	 Oh no! Did you take my bra too?!'
Rachel	 What bra?'
Monica	 The pink one with the flowers?!'
Rachel	 You mean the one that you\xc2\x92re wearing? (Adjusts Monica\xc2\x92s pink\nbra strap as Monica looks down her shirt.)'
Brenda	 (entering) I quit! (Storms off.)'
Monica	 Sounds about right.'
Rachel	 What is this?'
Joey	 Hey! Uh, this is just to give you an idea. Okay well, we can put screens\nhere, (In front of the crib.) so that the baby has privacy, and-and-and maybe a mobile\nover the crib. And uh\xc2\x97Oh look! Here\xc2\x92s a baby monitor (Holds it up), which until\nthe baby comes we can use as walkie-talkies. Huh?'
Rachel	 You\xc2\x92re so sweet. (Notices something in the crib.) Oh my God! And\nyou gave the baby Hugsy! (A stuffed penguin wearing a ski jacket, goggles, and hat.)'
Joey	 Ahhhhhhhhhhhh\xc2\x85. That-that-that\xc2\x92s really just to show where the\nbaby would go. Y\xc2\x92know why don\xc2\x92t I hold on to him so that there\xc2\x92s no\nconfusion? (Takes him back, sets him on the chair, and apologizes to him.)'
Rachel	 But Joey the baby is going to be crying, it\xc2\x92s going to be loud.'
Joey	 I\xc2\x92m loud!'
Rachel	 It\xc2\x92s gonna be up all night!'
Joey	 I\xc2\x92m up all night!'
Rachel	 It\xc2\x92s gonna poop!'
Joey	 Hello!'
Rachel	 What about all the women you want to bring home?'
Joey	 Look, if I\xc2\x92m bringing home a woman who can\xc2\x92t stand being around\na baby, then maybe I don\xc2\x92t want to be with that woman! Or maybe we\xc2\x92ll just do it\nin the bathroom of the club!'
Rachel	 Joey, are you sure?'
Joey	 Yeah! All right\xc2\x97Look, I know sometimes it\xc2\x92ll be hard, okay? But,\nit\xc2\x92ll also be really\xc2\x85really great. Please Rachel! I-I-I really want you to stay.'
Rachel	 I want me to stay too.'
Joey	 Ohh!'
Rachel	 Thank you. (They hug.) Oh Joey and look at this crib! It\xc2\x92s so cute!'
Joey	 I know! I found it on the street.'
Rachel	 Are you serious\xc2\x97Really?! It\xc2\x92s in such good condition.'
Joey	 Yeah.'
Rachel	 Wow! Whoa-whoa what\xc2\x92s under the covers?'
Joey	 I don\xc2\x92t know.'
Rachel	 It\xc2\x92s moving.'
Joey	 Ew.'
Rachel	 It\xc2\x92s still\xc2\x97(Screams)\xc2\x97It\xc2\x92s got a tail! Get it out of\nhere! Get it out of here!!'
Joey	 Ooh! Ah! Okay! (Quickly drags the crib outside.)'


Ross	 Well, the old lady died. And how do I know? Her dying wish was for one\nlast kiss. But I don\xc2\x92t care, (To Rachel) because you got the apartment. Yes!'
Rachel	 Ewww. Yeah. Umm. I think I\xc2\x92m gonna stay here.'
Joey	 Isn\xc2\x92t that great?'
Ross	 (stutters looking for words) Ezels!!'
