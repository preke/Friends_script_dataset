Rachel	 Here you go Pheebs. Who else wants one of my special homemade brownies? '
Chandler	 I will have one. (Ross and him both take one.)'
Chandler	 Okay, I\xc2\x92m not gonna have one.'
Ross	 Neither will I. (they both put back the brownies.)'
Phoebe	 No, no, it\xc2\x92s just my tooth.'
Chandler	 All right I\xc2\x92ll have one. (he and Ross take another brownie,)'
Ross	 So what\xc2\x92s a matter, you need a dentist? I\xc2\x92ve got a good one.'
Phoebe	 No thanks, I have a good one too. I just, I, I can\xc2\x92t see him.'
Chandler	 See that is the problem with invisible dentists.'
Ross	 Why? Why can\xc2\x92t you go to him?'
Phoebe	 Because, every time I go to the dentist, somebody dies.'
Chandler	 That is so weird, because every time I go to the dentist, I look down\nthe hygienist\xc2\x92s blouse.'
Rachel	 Phoebe, what? Umm...what?!'
Phoebe	 Yeah, yeah, first there was my aunt Mary, and then there was umm, John,\nmy mailman, and then my, my cowboy friend \xc2\x91Albino Bob\xc2\x92.'
Rachel	 And all these people actually died?'
Phoebe	 Yes, while I was in the chair! That\xc2\x92s why I take such good care of\nmy teeth now, y'know, it\xc2\x92s not about oral hygiene, I floss to save lives!"
Ross	 Pheebs, come on, you didn\xc2\x92t kill anybody, these people just happened\nto die when you went to the dentist. It\xc2\x92s, it\xc2\x92s, it\xc2\x92s just ah, a\ncoincidence.'
Phoebe	 Well tell that to them. Oh! You can\xc2\x92t, their dead.'

Ross	 Thanks, Gunther. (takes the plate Gunther serves him and Rachel comes up\nand kisses him) (to Rachel) Hey! (to Gunther) Umm, can I get a napkin too?'
Gunther	 Oh, like you don\xc2\x92t already have everything.'
Phoebe	 (trying to bite into an apple) Ow! Ow! (drops the apple in disgust.)'
Rachel	 Phoebe, your in pain, would you just go to the dentist, just go.'
Phoebe	 All right, fine, fine, but if you\xc2\x92re my next victim, don\xc2\x92t\ncome back as a poltergeist and like suck me into the TV set.'
Rachel	 I promise.'
Phoebe	 Although, don\xc2\x92t feel like you can\xc2\x92t visit.'
Joey	 (entering with Monica) Hey, is, is, is Chandler here?'
Ross	 (patting his clothes like he is looking for his wallet) No, no he\xc2\x92s\nnot.'
Monica	 You guys, Joey just saw Janice kissing her ex-husband.'
Ross	 What? (to Joey) So what are you going to do? I mean how, how are you going\nto tell Chandler?'
Joey	 Well, I was thinking about that and I, I think the best way would be, to\nnot.'
Rachel	 Joey, you can\xc2\x92t keep this to yourself, if you know about this, you\nhave to tell him.'
Joey	 It\xc2\x92ll kill him. I mean it\xc2\x92ll, it\xc2\x92ll just kill him.'
Phoebe	 Well, you could wait \xc2\x91til I go to the dentist, maybe I\xc2\x92ll\nkill him.'
Joey	 (looking out the window) Ewww! Ugly Naked Guy is using his new hammock.\nIt\xc2\x92s like a Play-Doo Fat Factory. '
Phoebe	 Well, I\xc2\x92m going to the dentist, so listen, okay, just be on the\nlook out for anything that, that, that you can fall into, or, or that can fall on you,\nor... All right, just look out! Okay, And um, I also just wanna, I just wanna tell you all\nthat um...... (starts to cry and runs out)'
Ross	 Okay, I have a problem I have to go into work for a few hours, some kids\nmessed up the Homo Sapien display.'
Joey	 What did they do?'
Ross	 Well, they painted over the word \xc2\x91Sapien\xc2\x92 for one thing, then\nthey rearranged the figures, let\xc2\x92s just leave it at that.'
Monica	 So, do you want me to watch Ben for you?'
Ross	 Yes, that\xc2\x92s what I was going to ask, thank you.'
Rachel	 Whoa! Wait! Hello! What about me?'
Ross	 You? You! Want to watch Ben? (in the background Monica mouths\n\xc2\x91Don\xc2\x92t worry, I\xc2\x92ll be here the whole time.\xc2\x92 to Ross.) Yes! That\xc2\x92d\nbe great, no, I just wanted to ask Monica, because I know how empty her life is. (Monica\nsarcastically mouths \xc2\x91Yeah!\xc2\x92 and holds up her thumb.)'
Joey	 Hey-hey, Ross?'
Ross	 Yeah.'
Joey	 I\xc2\x92ve got a science question.'
Ross	 Hmm?'
Joey	 If the Homo Sapiens, were in fact \xc2\x91Homo-sapien\xc2\x92, is that why\nthere extinct?'
Ross	 Joey, Homo Sapiens are people.'
Joey	 Hey-hey, I\xc2\x92m not judging.'
Rachel	 (holding Ben) Look Benny, spoon. (moves it back and forth) Spoon. Come\non! All right, y'know what I think he\xc2\x92s bored."
Monica	 Here. Ben, do you wanna play the airplane game, do you wanna show\nRachel? Come here. (takes Ben) We\xc2\x92re gonna do something fun. Okay. (throws Ben up in\nthe air a little bit and catches him) Weee!! (moves into the living room and does it\nagain) Weee!! (starts to walk back into the kitchen as she does it again, and hits\nBen\xc2\x92s head on that wooden beam across the ceiling.)'
Monica	 (to Ben) Who\xc2\x92s so brave, you\xc2\x92re so brave, yes you are,\nyou\xc2\x92re so brave.'
Rachel	 Okay. Okay honey, he\xc2\x92s fine, he\xc2\x92s fine, let\xc2\x92s just put\nhim down. Come here, Ben. (sets him on the couch) See that\xc2\x92s a good boy. (to Monica)\nHow could you do that to him!! Ross trusted me, what is he going to say?!'
Monica	 He\xc2\x92s not gonna say anything, because we\xc2\x92re not gonna tell him.'
Rachel	 We\xc2\x92re not?!'
Monica	 No we\xc2\x92re not.'
Rachel	 All right, I like that. '
Monica	 Okay.'
Rachel	 So we\xc2\x92re okay, we\xc2\x92re okay, we\xc2\x92re okay, (starts to exam\nBen) aren\xc2\x92t we? No, we\xc2\x92re not okay, we\xc2\x92re not okay, there\xc2\x92s a bump,\nthere\xc2\x92s a bump.'
Monica	 Oh my God! Well push it in! Push it in!'
Rachel	 I cannot push it in!'
Monica	 Okay, we\xc2\x92re gonna need a distraction.'
Rachel	 Okay, okay, okay.'
Monica	 I got it!'
Rachel	 Okay.'
Monica	 The second that Ross walks in that door, I want you take him back to\nyour bedroom and do whatever it is that you do that makes him go, (high pitched) rweee!!'
Rachel	 Or. We could put a hat on his head.'
Monica	 A hat! Yes! We need a hat.'
Rachel	 We need a hat..'
Monica	 Where are we gonna find a tiny little hat?'
Rachel	 Oh, oh, oh, I\xc2\x92ll get \xc2\x91Rainy Day Bear\xc2\x92!! (runs to get him)'
Monica	 Because he\xc2\x92ll know what to do? (Rachel comes out of her room with a\nbear that\xc2\x92s dressed in a rain suit.) Oh my God, you\xc2\x92re a genius!'
Rachel	 Oh God, oh God, it\xc2\x92s sowed on though.'
Monica	 Give it. Give it.'
Rachel	 Okay.'
Monica and Rachel	 Oh!!'
Rachel	 Oh, it\xc2\x92s just like a bloodbath in here today.'
Chandler	 Hey! Hold on a minute, hold on a second. Do you think these pearls are\nnice?'
Joey	 I\xc2\x92d really prefer a mountain bike.'
Chandler	 Janice\xc2\x92s birthday is coming up, I want to get her something\nspeacial. Come in here with me.'
Joey	 Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, whoa. Do you ah, want to get her something\nspeacial, get her flowers, get her candy, get her gum, girls love gum.'
Chandler	 That\xc2\x92s a good idea, \xc2\x91Dear Janice have a Hubba-Bubba\nbirthday\xc2\x92. I would like to get her something serious.'
Joey	 Oh, you want something serious. Y'know what you should do, you should get\nher one of those um, barium enemas. Those are dead serious."
Chandler	 All right. Look, I\xc2\x92m gonna go in here, and you don\xc2\x92t buy me\nanything ever. (starts to go into the store)'
Joey	 (stopping him) No, no, you can\xc2\x92t, you can\xc2\x92t, okay, you\ncan\xc2\x92t, you can\xc2\x92t buy her pearls, you just can\xc2\x92t, you can\xc2\x92t, you\ncan\xc2\x92t.'
Chandler	 Why not?!'
Joey	 Oh God. Uh, okay, here\xc2\x92s the thing, this is the thing, okay, the\nthing is...'
Chandler	 What is the thing?'
Joey	 Okay. I went down to the \xc2\x91Mattress King\xc2\x92 showroom and, and I saw\nJanice, kissing her ex-husband.'
Chandler	 (shocked) What?'
Joey	 They were in his office.'
Chandler	 Well she, she wouldn\xc2\x92t do that, she\xc2\x92s with, she\xc2\x92s with\nme.'
Joey	 I\xc2\x92m telling you man, I saw it.'
Chandler	 Yeah, well, you\xc2\x92re wrong! Okay, you\xc2\x92re wrong.'
Joey	 I\xc2\x92m not wrong! I wish I was. I\xc2\x92m sorry. Bet that barium enema\ndoesn\xc2\x92t sound so bad now, huh?'
Monica	 It just makes more sense as an ensemble.'
Rachel	 Right.'
Monica	 Besides, it takes the focus off the hat.'
Phoebe	 (running through the door) No! Oh! You\xc2\x92re alive! You\xc2\x92re alive!'
Rachel	 See Pheebs, I promised you no one would die, didn\xc2\x92t I?'
Phoebe	 Yeah, well, we\xc2\x92ll see about that. Can I use your phone? I just\nwanna call everyone I know.'

Monica	 Did he just say \xc2\x91Monica bang\xc2\x92?'
Rachel	 Uh-huh.'
Monica	 Oh my God! He\xc2\x92s gonna rat me out!'
Ben	 Monica bang!'
Monica	 Oh-ho-ho, sweetie, sweetie, you gotta stop saying that, now. It\xc2\x92s\nno big deal, it\xc2\x92s not even worth mentioning, you see we all do it all the time. See\nwatch this, Ben, Ben, Ben. (goes over and starts hitting her head on the post) Ow, Monica\nbang! (does it again) Everybody bang. (repeats) Ben bang. (repeats) Rachel bang. (repeats)\nBang, Rachel bang! Oh, isn\xc2\x92t that fun?'
Rachel	 (goes over and hits her head on the post) Look at that! (repeats) Look\nat that! (repeats) We all do it. (repeats) Okay, I\xc2\x92m stopping now.'
Monica	 You okay?'
Rachel	 Oh yeah! Y'know, if it\xc2\x92s not a headboard, it\xc2\x92s just not worth\nit."
Janice	 (entering) How\xc2\x92s my Bing-a-ling?'
Chandler	 Ah, I don\xc2\x92t know, you tell me. Anything you ah, wanna tell me,\nbecause, if you ah, you should, if you, you would, tell me.'
Janice	 Why are your eyes so white?'
Chandler	 You tell me! Maybe, it\xc2\x92s because I was just fooling with my ex!\nOh no-no-no-no, no-no-no-no, that was you!!'
Janice	 Oh my God!!'
Chandler	 All right!'
Janice	 How did you know?'
Chandler	 Joey told me, he saw you two kissing.'

Chandler	 I\xc2\x92ll take it! All right look, I gotta know. Are you finished with\nme? (Janice shakes her head no) Are you finished with him? (Janice shakes her head no) Do\nyou still love him? (Janice shakes her head yes) Do you still love me? (Janice shakes her\nhead yes) All right look, (grabs the bag) I\xc2\x92m gonna need an actual answer here okay,\nso which is it, him or me? (his phone starts to ring)'
Janice	 I don\xc2\x92t know.'
Phoebe	 (rushing in) Okay. If you\xc2\x92re alive you answer your phone!'

Monica	 Okay, Ben, I won\xc2\x92t tell your daddy that you had ice cream for\ndinner, if you don\xc2\x92t tell about our little bonking incident.'
Rachel	 Monica, number one, I don\xc2\x92t think Ben understands the concept of\nbribery, and number two, I... (Joey starts laughing in the background) (to Joey) What?!'
Joey	 You said number two.'
Rachel	 I also said number one.'
Joey	 I know. (giggles harder)'
Ross	 (entering) Hey! Everyone.'
Rachel	 Hi!'
Ross	 How\xc2\x92s my little boy?'
Rachel	 He\xc2\x92s perfect, he\xc2\x92s never been better.'
Ross	 (noticing the outfit he is wearing) What\xc2\x92d you do, take him whaling?'
Ben	 Monica.'
Ross	 Oh my God, he just said your name, that\xc2\x92s great! Good job Ben.'
Ben	 Monica bang!'
Monica	 Oh that\xc2\x92s right, that\xc2\x92s what I\xc2\x92d sound like if I\nexploded.'
Phoebe	 Woo-Hoo! The curse is broken! I called everybody I know, and everyone is\nalive.'
Joey	 Uh.'
Phoebe	 What?'
Joey	 Ugly Naked Guy looks awfully still. (Phoebe runs to the window and gasps.)'
Phoebe	 Oh my God! I killed him! I killed another one! And this curse is getting\nstronger too, to bring down something that big.'
Rachel	 Well maybe he\xc2\x92s just taking a nap.'
Joey	 I\xc2\x92m tellin\xc2\x92 ya, he hasn\xc2\x92t moved since this morning.'
Monica	 All right, we should call somebody.'
Ross	 And tell them what? The naked guy we stare at all the time isn\xc2\x92t\nmoving.'
Rachel	 Well, we have gotta find out if he\xc2\x92s alive.'
Monica	 How are we gonna do that? There\xc2\x92s no way.'
Joey	 Well, there is one way. His window\xc2\x92s open, I say, we poke him.'
Joey	 Hey! Y'know how we ah, save all those chopsticks for no reason we get when\nwe get Chinese food?"
Chandler	 Yeah.'
Joey	 Well, now we got a reason.'
Chandler	 What?'
Joey	 Well, we\xc2\x92re fashioning a very long poking device.'
Chandler	 All right.'
Joey	 Hey uh, what\xc2\x92s a matter?'
Chandler	 I talked to Janice.'
Joey	 Oh my God, is she going back to him?'
Chandler	 She doesn\xc2\x92t know. Says she loves us both. Y'know I woke up this\nmorning and I was in love, well I was happy. Y'know it serves me right for buying that\ntwelve pack of condoms. And now I can\xc2\x92t even return them, because she choked on the\nreciept!"
Joey	 What are you ah, what are you gonna do?'
Chandler	 I don\xc2\x92t know, y'know. What, what, would you do?"
Joey	 Well, it doesn\xc2\x92t matter what I would do.'
Chandler	 Come on, tell me.'
Joey	 All right, you\xc2\x92re probably not gonna want to hear this but ah, if it\nwas me, and this is just me, (Chandler gets ready to throw another dart) I would ah, I\nwould bow out.'
Chandler	 What? (turns around quickly still ready to throw the dart and Joey\nquickly ducks and hides behind the chair) What are you, what are you talking about?'
Joey	 They have a kid together, y'know. They\xc2\x92re like, they\xc2\x92re like a\nfamily, and if, I don\xc2\x92t know, there\xc2\x92s chance they could make that work, I know I\nwouldn\xc2\x92t want to be the guy who stood in the way of that. Are you okay? Do you wanna\nah, come poke a nude guy?"
Ross	 Well, he\xc2\x92s finally alseep. About that ah, bump on his head?'
Rachel	 Are you, are you, are you sure it\xc2\x92s ah, a new bump? I mean, no\noffense, I\xc2\x92ve always thought of Ben as a fairly bumpy headed child.'
Ross	 It\xc2\x92s okay if he bumps his head, kids bump their heads all the time,\ny'know, it was your first time babysitting, I figured you did the best you could."
Rachel	 (confidently) I did!'
Ross	 I know! I\xc2\x92m saying you have to watch them all the time.'
Rachel	 I did!! I watched! I watched! I watched Monica bang his head against\nthat thing!'
Ross	 Monica did it?'
Ross	 Monica?'
Monica	 Yeah.'
Ross	 Umm, did you notice anything wierd about Ben today?'
Monica	 No. Why?'
Ross	 Well, I was just playing with him, and y'know we were doing the alphabet\nsong, which he used to be really good at, but suddenly he\xc2\x92s leaving out \xc2\x91e\xc2\x92\nand \xc2\x91f.\xc2\x92 It\xc2\x92s like they just ah, I don\xc2\x92t know, fell out of his head."
Monica	 Really?!'
Ross	 Oh, and also, he\xc2\x92s, he\xc2\x92s walkin\xc2\x92 kind of funny, his left\nleg is moving a lot faster than his right leg, and he\xc2\x92s in there just sort of\ny'know... (walks around in a circle) "
Monica	 Oh my God, I wrecked your baby!! (runs into the bedroom)'
Rachel	 I hope it\xc2\x92s still funny when you\xc2\x92re in hell.'
Monica	 (coming out of the bedroom) You jerk! You know how much I love that kid!\n(starts to chase Ross around the living room)'
Ross	 Monica bang! Monica bang! (runs into one of the posts) Ow!'
Rachel	 I\xc2\x92ll get the hat.'
Chandler	 Janice, I have something I need to tell you, and I want you to let me\nget through it, because it\xc2\x92s, it\xc2\x92s, it\xc2\x92s not gonna be easy.'
Janice	 Okay.'
Chandler	 I think you should go back with Gary. I don\xc2\x92t wanna be the guy\nthat breaks up a family, y'know when my parents split up, it was because of that guy.\nWhenever I would see him I was always think y'know \xc2\x91You\xc2\x92re the reason, you are\nthe reason why their not together.\xc2\x92 and I hated that guy. And it didn\xc2\x92t matter\nhow nice he was, or how happy he made my Dad."
Janice	 Wow!'
Chandler	 Yeah, well. It\xc2\x92s the right thing to do.'
Janice	 Oh! You\xc2\x92re right. Oh God. But, before I can say\n\xc2\x91good-bye\xc2\x92, there\xc2\x92s something I really need you to know, Chandler. The way\nI feel about you, it\xc2\x92s like, I finally understand what Lionel Richie\xc2\x92s been\nsinging about. Y'know, I mean what we have, it\xc2\x92s like movie love, you\xc2\x92re my\nsoulmate, and I can\xc2\x92t believe we\xc2\x92re not going to be spending the rest of our\nlives together."
Chandler	 Then don\xc2\x92t leave me!'
Janice	 What?'
Chandler	 Forget what I said, I was babbling! Pick me!'
Janice	 No, you were right, you were right. I mean, I-I-I\xc2\x92ve got to give my\nmarriage another chance.'
Chandler	 No you don\xc2\x92t! No, no, no, I say you have to give your divorce\nanother chance.'
Janice	 (standing up) I\xc2\x92m sorry. (hugs him)'
Chandler	 Ohhh. Don\xc2\x92t go.'
Janice	 No, I-I-I gotta go. (she starts to walk away, but Chandler doesn\xc2\x92t\nlet her go.)'
Chandler	 No. No! No! No!'
Janice	 Honey, honey, people are looking.'
Chandler	 I don\xc2\x92t care! (turns around and to the people watching them) I\ndon\xc2\x92t care!!'
Janice	 Yeah, um, I\xc2\x92m, I\xc2\x92m leaving now. (tries to get her leg out of\nChandler\xc2\x92s grasp, she finally does, but Chandler takes off her shoe.)'
Chandler	 You can\xc2\x92t leave! I have your shoe!'
Janice	 Good-bye Chandler Bing. (walks out with one shoe)'
Gunther	 Rachel has those in burgendy.'
Joey	 All right now remember, something this big and long is going to be\ndifficult to manuver, fortunately I have a lot of experience in that area.'
Ross	 Can we please focus here, a naked man\xc2\x92s life hangs in the balance!'
Phoebe	 I\xc2\x92m telling you he\xc2\x92s dead. What we are about to have here is a\ndead fat guy on a stick.'
Joey	 All right, ladies and gentlemen, let\xc2\x92s poke. (they start to advance\nthe giant poking device) Steady. Steady. Okay, a little higher. Careful of the angle.\nOkay, okay, we\xc2\x92re approaching the window (as he says this the camera cuts to their\nview of Ugly Naked Guy, so that we actually see him!) Thread the needle. Thread the\nneedle. '
Phoebe	 He\xc2\x92s alive! He\xc2\x92s a-live!!!'
Monica	 And yet, we\xc2\x92re still poking him.'
Joey	 Okay, retract the device, retract the device.'
Ross	 He does not look happy.'
Rachel	 Hey-hey, now he\xc2\x92s showing us his poking device.'
Joey	 Hey, that\xc2\x92s never gonna make it all the way over here, buddy!'

Chandler	 (singing) I\xc2\x92ll hold you close in my arms. (Phoebe\nenters) I can\xc2\x92t resist your charms. And love....'
Phoebe	 (joining him) Love....'
Chandler and Phoebe	 I\xc2\x92ll be a fool for you. I\xc2\x92m sure, you know I\ndon\xc2\x92t mind.'
Chandler	 (high pitched) No you know I don\xc2\x92t mind.'
Chandler and Phoebe	 Yes! You mean the world the world to me. Oh...'
Chandler	 I know.'
Phoebe	 I know.'
Chandler	 I\xc2\x92ve found.'
Phoebe	 I\xc2\x92ve found....'
Chandler and Phoebe	 ...in you, my endless (Phoebe goes high pitched,\nChandler goes low pitched) love. (they both look at each other.) My endless\nlove. (once again they don\xc2\x92t match tones, and they just look at each other)'
