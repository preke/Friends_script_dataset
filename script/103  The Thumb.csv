Phoebe	 (entering) Hi guys! '
All	 Hey, Pheebs! Hi! '
Ross	 Hey. Oh, oh, how'd it go? "
Phoebe	 Um, not so good. He walked me to the subway and said 'We should do this\nagain!' "
All	 Ohh. Ouch. '
Rachel	 What? He said 'we should do it again', that's good, right? "
Monica	 Uh, no. Loosely translated 'We should do this again' means 'You will\nnever see me naked'. "
Rachel	 Since when? '
Joey	 Since always. It's like dating language. Y'know, like 'It's not you' means\n'It is you'. "
Chandler	 Or 'You're such a nice guy' means 'I'm gonna be dating leather-wearing\nalcoholics and complaining about them to you'. "
Phoebe	 Or, or, y'know, um, 'I think we should see other people' means 'Ha, ha,\nI already am'. "
Rachel	 And everybody knows this? '
Joey	 Yeah. Cushions the blow. '
Chandler	 Yeah, it's like when you're a kid, and your parents put your dog to\nsleep, and they tell you it went off to live on some farm. "
Ross	 That's funny, that, no, because, uh, our parents actually did, uh, send\nour dog off to live on a farm. "
Monica	 Uh, Ross. '
Ross	 What? Wh- hello? The Millners' farm in Connecticut? The Millners, they had\nthis unbelievable farm, they had horses, and, and rabbits that he could chase and it was-\nit w- .....Oh my God, Chi Chi! "

Chandler	 "So how does it feel knowing you\'re about to die?" '
Joey	 "Warden, in five minutes my pain will be over. But you\'ll have to\nlive with the knowledge that you sent an honest man to die." '
Chandler	 Hey, that was really good! '
Joey	 Thanks! Let's keep going. "
Chandler	 Okay. "So. Whaddya want from me, Damone, huh?" '
Joey	 "I just wanna go back to my cell. \'Cause in my cell, I can\nsmoke." '
Chandler	 "Smoke away." '
Chandler	 I think this is probably why Damone smokes in his cell alone. '
Joey	 What? '
Chandler	 Relax your hand! '
Chandler	 Not so much! '
Joey	 Whoah! '
Chandler	 Hey! '
Joey	 Hey! '
Chandler	 Alright, now try taking a puff. '
Chandler	 Alright.. okay. No. Give it to me. '
Joey	 No no no, I am not giving you a cigarette. '
Chandler	 It's fine, it's fine. Look, do you wanna get this part, or not? Here. "
Chandler	 Don't think of it as a cigarette. Think of it as the thing that's been\nmissing from your hand. When you're holding it, you feel right. You feel complete. "
Joey	 Y'miss it? "
Chandler	 Nah, not so much. Alright, now we smoke. (Takes a puff.) Oh.. my..\nGod. (He continues to smoke.) '
Monica	 No, no, no. They say it's the same as the distance from the tip of a\nguy's thumb to the tip of his index finger. "
Joey	 That's ridiculous! "
Ross	 Can I use.. either thumb? '
Rachel	 (carrying a tray of drinks) Alright, don't tell me, don't tell me!\n(Starts handing them out.) Decaf cappucino for Joey.. Coffee black.. Late.. And an iced\ntea. I'm getting pretty good at this! "
All	 Yeah. Yeah, excellent. '
Rachel	 (leaving to serve others) Good for me! '
Joey	 Y'okay, Phoebe? "
Phoebe	 Yeah- no- I'm just- it's, I haven't worked- It's my bank. "
Monica	 What did they do to you? '
Phoebe	 It's nothing, it's just- Okay. I'm going through my mail, and I open up\ntheir monthly, you know, STATEMENT- "
Ross	 Easy. '
Phoebe	 - and there's five hundred extra dollars in my account. "
Chandler	 Oh, Satan's minions at work again... "
Phoebe	 Yes, 'cause now I have to go down there, and deal with them. "
Joey	 What are you talking about? Keep it! '
Phoebe	 It's not mine, I didn't earn it, if I kept it, it would be like\nstealing. "
Rachel	 Yeah, but if you spent it, it would be like shopping! '
Phoebe	 Okay. Okay, let's say I bought a really great pair of shoes. Do you know\nwhat I'd hear, with every step I took? 'Not-mine. Not-mine. Not-mine.' And even if I was\nhappy, okay, and, and skipping- 'Not-not-mine, not-not-mine, not-not-mine,\nnot-not-mine'... "
Monica	 We're with you. We got it. "
Phoebe	 Okay. I'd- just- I'd never be able to enjoy it. It would be like this\ngiant karmic debt. "
Rachel	 Chandler, what are you doing? '
Monica	 (puling him up) Hey. Whaddya doing? '
All	 Oh! Oh, God! '
Ross	 What is this?! '
Chandler	 I'm smoking. I'm smoking, I'm smoking. "
Phoebe	 Oh, I can't believe you! You've been so good, for three years! "
Chandler	 And this- is my reward! '
Ross	 Hold on a second, alright? Just think about what you went through the last\ntime you quit. '
Chandler	 Okay, so this time I won't quit! "
All	 Ohhh! Put it out! '
Chandler	 All right! I'm putting it out, I'm putting it out. (He drops it in\nPhoebe's coffee.) "
Phoebe	 Oh, no! I- I can't drink this now! "
Monica	 Alright. I'm gonna go change, I've got a date. "
Rachel	 This Alan again? How's it goin'? "
Monica	 'S'going pretty good, y'know? It's nice, and, we're having fun. "
Joey	 So when do we get to meet the guy? '
Monica	 Let's see, today's Monday... Never. "
All	 Oh, come on! Come on! '
Monica	 No. Not after what happened with Steve. '
Chandler	 What are you talking about? We love Schhteve! Schhteve was schhexy!..\nSorry. '
Monica	 Look, I don't even know how I feel about him yet. Just give me a chance\nto figure that out. "
Rachel	 Well, then can we meet him? '
Monica	 Nope. Schhorry. '
Monica	 I mean, why should I let them meet him? I mean, I bring a guy home, and\nwithin five minutes they're all over him. I mean, they're like- coyotes, picking off the\nweak members of the herd. "
Paula	 Listen. As someone who's seen more than her fair share of bad beef, I'll\ntell you
Monica	 I know. I just wish that once, I'd bring a guy home that they actually\nliked. "
Paula	 Well, you do realise the odds of that happening are a little slimmer if\nthey never get to meet the guy.. '
Joey	 Let it go, Ross. '
Ross	 Yeah, well, you didn't know Chi Chi. "
Monica	 Do you all promise? '
All	 Yeah! We promise! We'll be good! "
Monica	 (shouts to Chandler) Chandler? Do you promise to be good? '
Joey	 You can come in, but your filter-tipped little buddy has to stay outside! '
Ross	 Hey, Pheebs. '
Phoebe	 'Dear Ms. Buffay. Thank you for calling attention to our error. We have\ncredited your account with five hundred dollars. We're sorry for the inconvenience, and\nhope you'll accept this- (Searches in her purse) -football phone as our free gift.'\nDo you believe this?! Now I have a thousand dollars, and a football phone! "
Rachel	 What bank is this? '
Monica	 Hey. It's him. (On the intercom) Who is it? "
Alan	 (on the intercom) It's Alan. "
Joey	 (shouting to Chandler) Chandler! He's here! "
Monica	 (to all) Okay, please be good, please. Just remember how much you\nall like me. '
Monica	 Hi. Alan, this is everybody. Everybody, this is Alan. '
Alan	 Hi. '
All	 Hi, Alan. '
Alan	 I've heard schho much about all you guyschh! "
Monica	 (to Alan) Thanks. I'll call you tomorrow. (Alan exits, to all) Okay.\nOkay, let's let the Alan-bashing begin. Who's gonna take the first shot, hmm? "
Monica	 C'mon! "
Ross	 ...I'll go. Let's start with the way he kept picking at- no, I'm sorry, I\ncan't do this, can't do this. We loved him. "
All	 Loved him! Yeah! He's great! "
Monica	 Wait a minute! We're talking about someone that I'm going out\nwith? "
All	 Yeah! '
Rachel	 And did you notice...? (She spreads her thumb and index finger.) '
The Guys	 (reluctantly) Yeah. '
Joey	 Know what was great? The way his smile was kinda crooked. '
Phoebe	 Yes, yes! Like the man in the shoe! '
Ross	 ...What shoe? '
Phoebe	 From the nursery rhyme. 'There was a crooked man, Who had a crooked\nsmile, Who lived in a shoe, For a... while...' "
Ross	 ...So I think Alan will become the yardstick against which all future\nboyfriends will be measured. '
Rachel	 What future boyfriends? Nono, I th- I think this could be, y'know, it. "
Monica	 Really! '
Chandler	 Oh, yeah. I'd marry him just for his David Hasselhof impression alone.\nYou know I'm gonna be doing that at parties, right? (Does the impression) "
Ross	 You know what I like most about him, though? '
All	 What? '
Ross	 The way he makes me feel about myself. '
All	 Yeah... '

Monica	 Hi.. how was the game? '
Ross	 Well.. '
All	 WE WON!! Thank you! Yes! '
Monica	 Fantastic! I have one question
Joey	 Alan. '
Ross	 He was unbelievable. He was like that-that-that Bugs Bunny cartoon where\nBugs is playing all the positions, right, but instead of Bugs it was first base-Alan,\nsecond base-Alan, third base-... '
Rachel	 I mean, it-it was like, it was like he made us into a team. '
Chandler	 Yep, we sure showed those Hassidic jewellers a thing or two about\nsoftball.. '
Monica	 Can I ask you guys a question? D'you ever think that Alan is maybe..\nsometimes.. "
Ross	 What? '
Monica	 ..I dunno, a little too Alan? '
Rachel	 Well, no. That's impossible. You can never be too Alan. "
Ross	 Yeah, it's his, uh, innate Alan-ness that-that-that we adore. "
Chandler	 I personally could have a gallon of Alan. '
Phoebe	 Hey, Lizzie. '
Lizzie	 Hey, Weird Girl. '
Phoebe	 I brought you alphabet soup. '
Lizzie	 Did you pick out the vowels? '
Phoebe	 Yes. But I left in the Ys. \'Cause, y\'know, "sometimes y". Uh,\nI also have something else for you. (She searches in her purse.) '
Lizzie	 Saltines? '
Phoebe	 No, but would you like a thousand dollars and a football phone? '
Lizzie	 What? (She opens the envelope Phoebe has given her.) Oh my God, there's\nreally money in here. "
Phoebe	 I know. '
Lizzie	 Weird Girl, what are you doing? '
Phoebe	 No, I want you to have it. I don't want it. "
Lizzie	 No, no, I ha-I have to give you something. '
Phoebe	 Oh, that's fine, no. "
Lizzie	 Would you like my tin-foil hat? '
Phoebe	 No. 'Cause you need that. No, it's okay, thanks. "
Lizzie	 Please, let me do something. '
Phoebe	 Okay, alright, you buy me a soda, and then we're even. Okay? "
Lizzie	 Okay. '
Phoebe	 Okay. '
Lizzie	 Keep the change. (To Phoebe) Sure you don't wanna pretzel? "
Phoebe	 No, I'm fine. "
Lizzie	 (leaves) See ya. '
Phoebe	 Huh! '
Ross	 A thumb?! '
All	 Eww! '
Phoebe	 I know! I know, I opened it up and there it was, just floating in there,\nlike this tiny little hitch-hiker! '
Chandler	 Well, maybe it's a contest, y'know? Like, collect all five? "
Phoebe	 Does, um, anyone wanna see? '
All	 Nooo! '
All	 Oh, hey, don't do that! Cut it out! "
Rachel	 It's worse than the thumb! "
Chandler	 Hey, this is so unfair! '
Monica	 Oh, why is it unfair? '
Chandler	 So I have a flaw! Big deal! Like Joey's constant knuckle-cracking\nisn't annoying? And Ross, with his over-pronouncing every single word? And Monica, with\nthat snort when she laughs? I mean, what the hell is that thing? ...I accept all those\nflaws, why can't you accept me for this? "
Joey	 ...Does the knuckle-cracking bother everybody? '
Rachel	 Well, I-I could live without it. '
Joey	 Well, is it, like, a little annoying, or is it like when Phoebe chews her\nhair? '
Ross	 Oh, now, don't listen to him, Pheebs, I think it's endearing. "
Joey	 Oh, (Imitating Ross) "you do, do you"? '
Ross	 You know, there's nothing wrong with speaking correctly. "
Rachel	 "Indeed there isn\'t"... I should really get back to work. '
Phoebe	 Yeah, 'cause otherwise someone might get what they actually ordered. "
Rachel	 Ohh-ho-hooohhh. The hair comes out, and the gloves come on. '
Monica	 Did you ever go out with a guy your friends all really like? '
Paula	 No. '
Monica	 Okay.. Well, I'm going out with a guy my friends all really like. "
Paula	 Waitwait.. we talking about the coyotes here? All right, a cow got\nthrough! '
Monica	 Can you believe it? ...Y'know what? I just don't feel the thing.\nI mean, they feel the thing, I don't feel the thing. "
Paula	 Honey.. you should always feel the thing. Listen, if that's how\nyou feel about the guy, Monica, dump him! "
Monica	 I know.. it's gonna be really hard. "
Paula	 Well, he's a big boy, he'll get over it. "
Monica	 No, he'll be fine. It's the other five I'm worried about. "
Joey	 Do you have any respect for your body? '
Ross	 Don't you realise what you're-you're doing to yourself? "
Chandler	 Hey, y'know, I have had it with you guys and your cancer and your\nemphysema and your heart disease. The bottom line is, smoking is cool, and you know it. "
Rachel	 (holding the phone out to Chandler) Chandler? It's Alan, he wants to\nspeak to you. "
Chandler	 Really? He does? (taking the phone) Hey, buddy, what's up! Oh, she\ntold you about that, huh. Well, yeah, I have one now and then. Well, yeah, now. Well, it's\nnot that big- ..well, that's true,.. Gee, y'know, no-one- no-one's ever put it like that\nbefore. Well, okay, thanks! (He hands the phone back and stubs out his cigarette.) "
Rachel	 (to Ross, who has wandered up) God, he's good. "
Ross	 If only he were a woman. '
Rachel	 Yeah. '
Chandler	 Ooh, Lambchop. How old is that sock? If I had a sock on my hand for\nthirty years it'd be talking too. "
Ross	 Okay. I think it's time to change somebody's nicotine patch. (Does so.) "
Monica	 (entering) Hey. Where's Joey? "
Chandler	 Joey ate my last stick of gum, so I killed him. Do you think that was\nwrong? '
Rachel	 I think he's across the hall. "
Monica	 Thanks. (Goes to fetch him.) '
Ross	 (finishing changing Chandler's nicotine patch) There y'go. "
Chandler	 (deadpan) Ooh, I'm alive with pleasure now. "
Ross	 Hey Pheebs, you gonna have the rest of that Pop-Tart?.. Pheebs? '
Phoebe	 Does anyone want the rest of this Pop-Tart? '
Ross	 Hey, I might! '
Phoebe	 Sorry. ..Y'know, those stupid soda people gave me seven thousand dollars\nfor the thumb. "
All	 You're kidding. Oh my God. "
Phoebe	 And on my way over here, I stepped in gum. ...What is up with the\nuniverse?! '
Joey	 (dragged in by Monica, he has just gotten out of the shower) What's going\non? "
Monica	 Nothing. I just think it's nice when we're all here together. "
Joey	 Even nicer when everyone gets to wear their underwear.. '
Rachel	 Uh, Joey.. '
Joey	 Oh, God! (Hurriedly closes his legs.) '
Monica	 (turns off the TV) Okay.. '
All	 Oh! That was Lambchop! '
Monica	 Please, guys, we have to talk. '
Phoebe	 Wait, wait, I'm getting a deja vu...no, I'm not. "
Monica	 Alright, we have to talk. '
Phoebe	 There it is! '
Monica	 Okay. It's-it's about Alan. There's something that you should know. I\nmean, there's really no easy way to say this.. uh.. I've decided to break up with Alan. "
Ross	 Is there somebody else? '
Monica	 No, nononono.. it's just.. things change. People change. "
Rachel	 We didn't change.. "
Joey	 So that's it? It's over? Just like that? "
Phoebe	 You know.. you let your guard down, you start to really care about\nsomeone, and I just- I- (starts chewing her hair) '
Monica	 Look, I- I could go on pretending- '
Joey	 Okay! '
Monica	 -but that wouldn't be fair to me, it wouldn't be fair to Alan- It\nwouldn't be fair to you! "
Ross	 Who-who wants fair? Y'know, I just want things back. Y'know, the way they\nwere. "
Monica	 I'm sorry.. "
Chandler	 (sarcastic) Oh, she's sorry! I feel better! "
Rachel	 (tearful) I just can't believe this! I mean, with the holidays coming\nup- I wanted him to meet my family- "
Monica	 I'll meet somone else. There'll be other Alans. "
All	 Oh, yeah! Right! '
Monica	 Are you guys gonna be okay? '
Ross	 Hey hey, we'll be fine. We're just gonna need a little time. "
Monica	 (dubious) I understand. '
Alan	 Wow. '
Monica	 I'm, I'm really sorry. "
Alan	 Yeah, I'm sorry too. But, I gotta tell you, I am a little relieved. "
Monica	 Relieved? '
Alan	 Yeah, well, I had a great time with you.. I just can't stand your friends.\n"

Rachel	 Remember when we went to Central Park and rented boats?.. That was fun. '
Ross	 Yeah. He could row like a viking. '
Monica	 (entering) Hi. '
All	 Mmm. '
Ross	 So how'd it go? "
Monica	 Oh, y'know.. "
Phoebe	 Did he mention us? '
Monica	 He said he's really gonna miss you guys. (dubious look) "
Ross	 You had a rough day, huh.. c'mere. (She sits down and Ross strokes her\nforehead.) "
Chandler	 ...That's it. I'm getting cigarettes. "
All	 No no no! '
Chandler	 (leaving) I don't care, I don't care! Game's over! I'm weak! I've\ngotta smoke! I've gotta have the smoke! "
Phoebe	 (shouting as he leaves) If you never smoke again I'll give you seven\nthousand dollars! "
Chandler	 (returns) Yeah, alright.'
