Ben	 (on the bike) I\xc2\x92m ready!'
Ross	 You sure?'
Ben	 Uh-huh!'
Chandler	 Okay, let me just straighten out your helmet there. (Does so.)'
Ben	 (To Chandler) Thanks daddy.'
Ross	 No-no, one daddy, two mommies. All right, it\xc2\x92s all yours.\n(Ross pushes him off.)'
Chandler	 Okay. Okay.'
Ross	 Yes! Yes! Yes!! (Everyone stands and claps.)'
Phoebe	 His first big kid\xc2\x92s bike, this is so exciting!'
Monica	 Oh yeah, I remember mine! Ohh, it was my sixth birthday, my dad took me\nto the park, I got it, and\xc2\x85it bent.'
Ross	 Yeah.'
Phoebe	 I never had a bike of my own.'
Ross	 (shocked) What?!'
Phoebe	 Well, we didn\xc2\x92t have a lot of money. But the girl across the street\nhad the best bike! It was pink and it had rainbow colored tassels hanging off the\nhandle grips, and-and-and a bell and this big, white wicker basket with those\nplastic daisies stuck on.'
Chandler	 That sounds like my first bike. (They all turn and look at him.) My\ndad gave me his old one.'
Ross	 Ohh.'
Monica	 Did the girl ever let you ride it?'
Phoebe	 No! But she gave me the box that it came in. It had a picture of the\nbike on the front. (They\xc2\x92re all speechless) So I would sit on it and my step-dad\nwould drag me around the backyard.'
Ross	 That is so unfair!'
Phoebe	 Not really, I got to drag him around too! (They all nod,\n"Oh.")'

Chandler	 Hey! What are you guys doing? '
Joey	 Hey.'
Monica	 Making holiday candy for the neighbors.'
Chandler	 I\xc2\x92m sorry, who?'
Monica	 I\xc2\x92m gonna hang this basket (Points to the one sitting on the table)\non the door and when the neighbors walk by they can all take a piece.'
Chandler	 But we don\xc2\x92t know the neighbors.'
Joey	 I do. There\xc2\x92s uh, let\xc2\x92s see, Guy With a Mustache, Smokes-A-Lot\nLady, Some Kids I\xc2\x92ve Seen, and A Red-haired Guy Who Does Not Like To Be Called Rusty.'
Monica	 See? This is exactly why I\xc2\x92m making this candy. We can learn\ntheir names and get to know our neighbors.'
Chandler	 Wouldn\xc2\x92t it be easier if we just moved?'
Rachel	 (entering, happily) Gooood morning!!'
Chandler	 Eh, somebody\xc2\x92s in a good mood!'
Rachel	 Well, why shouldn\xc2\x92t I be? I have great friends! I have a wonderful\njob!'
Monica	 Where you can make out with your assistant.'
Rachel	 Come on, it\xc2\x92s not a big deal! We stayed up all night coming up with\na plan so that us dating will not be a problem.'
Monica	 Oh yeah, what\xc2\x92s the plan?'
Rachel	 (pauses as she thinks and exhales loudly) We\xc2\x85 We are not\xc2\x85\n\xc2\x85going to let it\xc2\x85 be a problem.'
Monica	 Wow! It took you all night to come up with that plan?!'
Rachel	 Well y\xc2\x92know, we did other stuff too. (Joey and Chandler start to\ngiggle.)'
Monica	 Did you two\xc2\x85'
Rachel	 Oh Monica come on, y\xc2\x92know I don\xc2\x92t sleep with guys on the first\ndate!'
Monica	 Matt Guire, Mark Lynn, Ben Wire\xc2\x85'
Rachel	 Anymore!!'
Monica	 Okay.'
Rachel	 Hi. Tag, I have a conference call today is that correct?'
Tag	 Yes, at 4
Rachel	 Okay, thank you. That\xc2\x92ll be all. (The mail guy leaves and Tag\nstarts to follow, but Rachel stops him.) (Excitedly) Wait! Wait! (Rushes over and closes\nthe office-door.) Did you see that? That mail guy had no idea there was something going on\nbetween us. (They kiss.)'
Tag	 I\xc2\x92d better get back to my desk.'
Rachel	 Okay, you hard worker! I\xc2\x92ll remember to put that in your\nevaluation.'
Tag	 My what?'
Rachel	 Well, you\xc2\x92ve been here for two months now and your boss is required\nto hand in a performance evaluation. But y\xc2\x92know, there is one thing that I have yet\nto evaluate. (She turns around and sweeps the stuff off of her desk and hops up onto it.) '
Tag	 Are you serious?'
Rachel	 No, I\xc2\x92ve just always wanted to do that. Can you help me clean this\nup?'
Monica	 The basket is totally empty! My God, the neighbors ate all the candy!'
Chandler	 Well, either that or uh\xc2\x85(Motions towards Joey\xc2\x92s door.)'
Monica	 Joey!! '
Joey	 Yeah?'
Monica	 Did you eat all the neighbor candy?!'
Joey	 Uh well yeah, that was the plan, but by the time I got to it there was\nonly a couple of pieces left!'
Phoebe	 Yeah, and they\xc2\x92ve been coming by all day. They love it!'
Monica	 They love my candy? Oh man!!! I\xc2\x92ve gotta go make more!! (Starts to\ndo so.)'
Joey	 Hey Mon, you might wanna make some more lasagna too, because something\nmight\xc2\x92ve happened to a huge chunk of it.'
Monica	 Ross! The neighbors ate all my candy!!'
Ross	 Mine stole my newspaper! It\xc2\x92s like a crime wave!! (Monica runs\nto make more candy.) Pheebs, you uh, you got a second.'
Phoebe	 Sure!'
Ross	 Yeah, ever since you uh, told me that story about that bike I-I\ncouldn\xc2\x92t stop thinking about it. I mean, everyone should have a-a first bike,\nso\xc2\x85 '
Phoebe	 (gasps) Oh my God Ross!!'
Ross	 You like it?'
Phoebe	 I love it!!'
Ross	 Yeah?'
Phoebe	 Ohh!! Ohh!! And I love you!'
Ross	 Ahh.'
Phoebe	 Not that way! But the bike brought you a lot closer!'
Ross	 Ah! (She hugs him.) Well uh-uh, t-take it downstairs, y\xc2\x92know give it\na test ride.'
Phoebe	 Okay! Oh my God! My first bike! Thank you for the best present I\xc2\x92ve\never gotten.'
Ross	 (stunned at the complement) You\xc2\x92re welcome.'
Phoebe	 (starts to leave, but stops) Oh and Chandler\xc2\x92s about to cry.'
Chandler	 (about to cry) Am not!'
Monica	 (turning a light on) Who is that?!'
Chandler	 Don\xc2\x92t worry, I\xc2\x92m brave! I am brave! I\xc2\x85I am brave! (They\nget to the door and Monica goes to open it.) No-no-no-no!! (He stops her.) (Through the\ndoor.) Can you tell me who is there please?'
Gary	 Hi!'
Monica	 Hi. Do you know what time it is?'
Gary	 It\xc2\x92s candy time! My roommate says that they taste like little drops\nof heaven.'
Monica	 Oh please! (To Chandler) Did you hear that? Little drops of heaven.'
Chandler	 (laughs) 4
Gary	 So, can I get some candy?'
Chandler	 I am sorry, but some of us have to get up early and go to work!\n(Monica looks at him) (To Monica) He does not know that I am not some of us.'
Monica	 Umm, listen I am sorry, but I\xc2\x92ll put some out first thing in the\nmorning.'
Gary	 Well okay, I\xc2\x92ll swing by later. Do you live in this building? '
Monica	 Um-hmm.'
Gary	 (looking at Monica.) Mm! Seems like I would\xc2\x92ve remembered you!'
Chandler	 Mm! Night Gar\xc2\x92! (Monica closes the door.)'
Rachel	 (hugging him) So did you read your evaluation yet?'
Tag	 No! It was marked confidential I just sent it down to Human Resources.'
Rachel	 (worried) Okay please, you\xc2\x92re kidding right?! I wrote that one as a\njoke for you!'
Tag	 A joke they would appreciate?'
Rachel	 I\xc2\x92m thinkin\xc2\x92 no.'
Tag	 What did you say?!'
Rachel	 Umm, I said I thought you were a good kisser, and uh, and that I like\nyour tiney-tiny touchie.'
Tag	 No, not my touchie.'
Rachel	 Well, it gets worse. When asked if you take initiative I wrote,\n"Yes, he was able to unhook my bra with minimal supervision," and under Problems\nwith Performance I wrote, "Dear God, I hope not," and then uh, then I drew a\nlittle smiley face, and then a small pornographic sketch.'
Monica	 Ross! That is so sweet of you to get Phoebe that bike! When I heard the\nstory, I almost cried.'
Joey	 Almost cried huh? Hear that Chandler? Almost cried!'
Chandler	 Hey, you cry every time somebody talks about Titanic!'
Joey	 (about to cry) Those two only had each other!'
Ross	 Phoebe really likes the bike huh?'
Monica	 Oh yeah! I saw her walkin\xc2\x92 it down the street the other day. She\nhad uh, these flowers in the basket. It was so cute.'
Joey	 Yeah, I saw her this morning walkin\xc2\x92 it by the park.'
Ross	 Wait a minute, she was walking the bike? Both times?'
Joey	 Hey Pheebs?'
Phoebe	 Oh hi!'
Chandler	 Hey! So are you enjoying the bike?'
Phoebe	 Ohh, uh-huh so much!'
Ross	 Pheebs you uh\xc2\x85you do know how to ride a bike don\xc2\x92t you?'
Phoebe	 Of course!'
Monica	 Umm, can we see you ride it?'
Phoebe	 Okay. (The gang is giggles then Phoebe gets the bike out of the rack,\ngets on, pushes off, rolls a few feet, and falls over.) See?'

Monica	 See, this is why I told you never get involved with your assistant! And\nhere is no such thing as keeping secrets when it comes to affairs. (To Chandler) Did you\nhear that Chandler? No such thing!'
Chandler	 (with his mouth full) What happened? I\xc2\x92m just eating candy.'
Rachel	 Maybe it\xc2\x92s not as bad as I think. Y\xc2\x92know, maybe they\ndidn\xc2\x92t take it the way I meant it.'
Chandler	 Absolutely! Y\xc2\x92know, because touchie can mean both ass and good\nworker.'
Rachel	 Ugh, I just gotta get the thing back!'
Joey	 Hey Rach?'
Rachel	 Yeah?'
Joey	 That sketch you mentioned? Might it have looked a little something like\nthis? (He shows her what he\xc2\x92s been drawing.)'
Rachel	 Oh my God! Joey!'
Chandler	 What is the matter with you?'
Rachel	 Ugh!'
Joey	 Boy I tell ya, this little talent came in handy before I could afford\nporn.'
The Woman	 Hi! I\xc2\x92m sorry, I know it\xc2\x92s after hours but I really need\ncandy.'
Monica	 I\xc2\x92m sorry, I can\xc2\x92t help you. See? (Points to her new sign.)\nRules are rules.'
The Woman	 Please! I have people coming from out of town today! And, I told them\nall about your candy!'
Monica	 No kidding, out of towners huh? What did you tell \xc2\x91em?'
The Woman	 I told \xc2\x91em your candy is absolutely indescribable!'
Monica	 Some people have been saying its y\xc2\x92know little drops of heaven, but\nwhatever.'
The Woman	 Please, can\xc2\x92t you help me out?'
Joey	 (watching the discussion) Hey Chandler, do we know that lady?'
Chandler	 Maybe, isn\xc2\x92t she the woman who lives below you and has sex really\nloud?'
Monica	 (still talking to the woman) All right, I\xc2\x92ll do it just this once!\nBut you can\xc2\x92t tell anybody!'
The Woman	 (exasperatedly) Yes! Yes! Please, just give it to me!'
Joey and Chandler	 Yeah, that\xc2\x92s her.'
The Woman	 (after Monica gives her the candy) Thank you.'
Monica	 (closing the door) It\xc2\x92s unbelievable! I-I can\xc2\x92t believe that\nsign didn\xc2\x92t work!'
Chandler	 Y\xc2\x92know what would work?'
Monica	 Hmm?'
Chandler	 Stop making candy!'
Monica	 But they like it!'
Chandler	 You mean they like you.'
Monica	 Maybe.'
Chandler	 Is that why you became a chef? So that people would like you?'
Monica	 Oh, you really want to talk about getting people to like you huh, funny\nman? (Joey laughs but stops when Chandler turns to glare at him.)'
Ross	 Okay, now just remember everything I taught you and you\xc2\x92ll be fine.\nOkay? Here we go. Ready\xc2\x85Set\xc2\x85'
Phoebe	 (hopping off the bike) Wait! This seat is really uncomfortable! Yeah,\nmaybe before we start we should just get another one. Perhaps, like an airplane\nseat\xc2\x97or a beanbag chair!'
Ross	 Phoebe, you can\xc2\x92t get out of this! Okay? You have to learn how\nto ride a bike!'
Phoebe	 Why? Why do I have to learn?'
Ross	 Well\xc2\x85In-in case of emergency.'
Phoebe	 What kind of an emergency?'
Ross	 Well let there\xc2\x97what if a man comes along and puts a gun to your head\nand says, "You ride this bike or I\xc2\x92ll sh\xc2\x85I\xc2\x92ll shoot you."'
Phoebe	 Okay, I would ring the bell to distract him and then I would knock the\ngun out of his hand with a Chinese throwing star.'
Ross	 Okay, Phoebe just-just get-get on the bike and\xc2\x97Hey! I\xc2\x92ll hold\nyou up and-and push you. Okay?'
Phoebe	 You won\xc2\x92t let go?'
Ross	 No!'
Phoebe	 Swear?!'
Ross	 I swear!'
Phoebe	 (thinks it over) Okay. '
Ross	 Come on. (She gets on the bike.) All right, here we go. All right? (They\nstart.) '
Phoebe	 All right.'
Ross	 All right. Feel good?'
Phoebe	 Well\xc2\x85'
Ross	 All right, try pedaling. '
Phoebe	 Okay. (Does so.)'
Ross	 That\xc2\x92s it, your doing great.'
Phoebe	 Okay.'
Ross	 Doing great! Yes-yes-yes! Take control! Yes!'
Phoebe	 Weee!!! (Ross pushes her and lets go.)'
Ross	 Yes!! Yes!!! (He starts clapping and Phoebe turns around to look at him\nand falls off the bike.)'
Phoebe	 Oh! Oh! Oh no!! You swore!'
Ross	 I-I just thought you were doing so well. I\xc2\x85'
Phoebe	 I am shocked! Shocked!! (She storms off leaving Ross to defend himself\nfrom the angry looks from onlookers.)'
Ross	 It\xc2\x92s a legitimate learning technique. (Looking around and seeing the\nwoman behind him glaring at him.) Wow!'
Ross	 Hey, there\xc2\x92s uh, some people outside, askin\xc2\x92 about candy.'
Monica	 Well, they\xc2\x92re just gonna have to wait aren\xc2\x92t they? I\xc2\x92ve\nonly got two hands!!'
Ross	 Need some help?'
Monica	 No! You don\xc2\x92t know the system! There\xc2\x92ll be nobody messing with\nthe system!'
Ross	 By the way, the week before your wedding you may not see a lot of me. (She\nglares at him and he quickly makes his way to Phoebe\xc2\x92s room.)'
Phoebe	 (seeing him) Oh, hello liar.'
Ross	 (entering) Look, I-I\xc2\x92m really sorry I let go of the bike.'
Phoebe	 I could\xc2\x92ve been killed I hope you know!'
Ross	 I know. I know. But, can we please try it again? Huh? I mean, you were so\nclose Phoebe!'
Phoebe	 Well, I would love to but\xc2\x85the bike got stolen and the police have\nno suspects. (Ross just happens to have his hand on a sheet that is covering something\nthat suspiciously looks like a bike.) '
Ross	 Phoebe.'
Phoebe	 What?! (Ross rings the bell.) What the hell?!'
Ross	 All right, y\xc2\x92know what? If you are not going to learn how to ride\nthis bike then I\xc2\x92m sorry, I\xc2\x92m just gonna have to take it back.'
Phoebe	 What?! Why?!'
Ross	 Because! Because, it-it-it\xc2\x92s\xc2\x85 It\xc2\x92d be like you having this\nguitar (Points to hers) and-and never playing it. Okay, this guitar wants to be\nplayed! And-and this bike wants to be ridden and-and if you don\xc2\x92t ride it\nyou-you\xc2\x92re-you\xc2\x92re killing its spirit! (Pause) The bike is dying.'
Phoebe	 All right. If you care enough to make up that load of crap, okay.'
Ross	 Great! Great! (He runs to the door.) You\xc2\x92re making the bike very\nhappy.'
Phoebe	 (sarcastically) Okay Ross! (Ross exits and she says quietly to the bike)\nPlease don\xc2\x92t die!'
Rachel	 Okay, I think we can get the evaluation back before they see it, but\nwe\xc2\x92re gonna have to get into Mr. Zelner\xc2\x92s office. Now, he doesn\xc2\x92t get in\nuntil 10, so he\xc2\x92s no problem, but his assistant, Betty, she comes in early to eat her\nbreakfast at her desk.'
Tag	 That\xc2\x92s kinda sad.'
Rachel	 Yeah, well Betty\xc2\x92s kinda sad. Which is why I believe I can lure her\naway with these chocolates. (Holding up the box of chocolates.) Now, while I distract her,\nyou get in the office.'
Tag	 Got it!'
Rachel	 Let\xc2\x92s roll!'
Mr. Zelner	 Hello Rachel, you uh, got a minute?'
Rachel	 (worried and shocked) Yeah, sure Mr. Zelner, for you\nanything\xc2\x97minute. Okay. Fine. (To Tag) Abort the plan, abort the plan. (She start to\nusher Tag out.)'
Mr. Zelner	 Uh actually, I\xc2\x92d like to speak with both of you.'
Rachel	 Okay. Uh, well can we, can we get you anything Mr. Zelner? Maybe some\nchocolates? (Holds up the box.)'
Mr. Zelner	 Umm, no. Thanks, but I\xc2\x92ll give these to Betty. (Rachel glances\nat Tag to say, "See?") So I read your evaluation of Tag, or to use his full\nname, Tag Sweetcheeks Jones. Is something going on with you two?'
Rachel	 (laughs) Oh my God. Can you imagine if there was?! I mean, (getting\nserious) what would happen exactly.'
Mr. Zelner	 Well, I\xc2\x92d be forced to file a report. I\xc2\x92d have to consult\nwith the legal department, and your future at the company would be in jeopardy.'
Rachel	 Well\xc2\x85'
Tag	 (interrupting) Uh Mr. Zelner, I\xc2\x92m the one who filled in that\nevaluation.'
Rachel	 Oh no-no-no\xc2\x85'
Tag	 (interrupting again) Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah, I thought it would be funny.'
Mr. Zelner	 You wrote that you have a cute touchie?'
Tag	 (pause) Yes. I have a weird sense of humor, and I\xc2\x92m kinda\nstrangely proud of my butt.'
Mr. Zelner	 It\xc2\x92s kind of a risky joke Tag, and what is-what is this drawing\nI can\xc2\x92t figure out what this is?'
Rachel	 You\xc2\x92re lookin\xc2\x92 at it upside down\xc2\x97y\xc2\x92know what? (Grabs\nthe evaluation and throws it out.) It doesn\xc2\x92t matter.'
Mr. Zelner	 Yeah, it\xc2\x92s not like I don\xc2\x92t have a sense of humor, huh?\nHell, I even enjoy a naughty limerick now and then. But there\xc2\x92s a time and a place,\nhuh?! Unless you uh, have a limerick right now? (They both nod no.) No? Okay, well uh,\nyou\xc2\x92ve (Grabs the chocolates.) got my fax number. (Exits.)'
Rachel	 Whoa! I can\xc2\x92t believe you did that. That was really sweet.'
Tag	 No, don\xc2\x92t worry about it.'
Rachel	 No, you could\xc2\x92ve lost your job.'
Tag	 Are you kidding me?! With a cute butt like this, I\xc2\x92d find work.'
Rachel	 Thank you! You\xc2\x92re great! (They kiss.)'
Tag	 Y\xc2\x92know what? '
Rachel	 What?'
Tag	 I feel great. (Rachel laughs) In fact! (Walks over to her desk, sweeps its\ncontents onto the floor and Rachel just glares at him.) What?'
Rachel	 I\xc2\x85 It just\xc2\x97it took me so long to get that desk organized.'
Tag	 Oh, I\xc2\x92m sorry. (He bends over to pick the stuff up.)'
Rachel	 (looking at his butt) There it is. (They hug.)'
Chandler	 (asking a man leaning against the wall) What is going on? '
The Man	 We\xc2\x92re waiting for the candy. (Yelling at the door.) Bring out the\ncandy!'
Joey	 Yeah lady! Give us candy!!'
Chandler	 Joey!'
Joey	 What\xc2\x92s up buddy?'
Chandler	 What are you doing?'
Joey	 Waiting for candy.'
Chandler	 Get in here! (They head for the door and Chandler sees Smokes-A-Lot\nLady standing next to the door and smoking, to her) Hey, and you can not smoke in here!\n(Takes the cigarette and takes a drag for himself.) (Exhaling in ecstasy) Merry Christmas.'
Monica	 (opening the door and frantically) Okay, guys! The candy is coming; I\njust need another 15 minutes for the chocolate to cool!'
All	 We want candy! We want candy now! (And other general commotion\nsounds.)'
Chandler	 All right everybody! Just be quiet! Be quiet! Be quiet!!\nPipe-pipe-pipe down! (They settle down) What is the matter with you people?! This woman\nwas trying to do a nice thing for you. She was making candy so she could try to get to\nknow all of you, and I\xc2\x92ll bet that not one of you can tell me her name! Am I right?'
The Man	 (from earlier) Candy Lady?'
Chandler	 No not (imitating) Candy Lady.'
Joey	 (stepping in and knocking the man over) Hey, if we know it can we have\ncandy?!!'
Chandler	 All right, y\xc2\x92know what? Forget it, all of you forget it!\nYou\xc2\x92ve ruined it! Go home! You\xc2\x92ve ruined it! You\xc2\x92ve ruined it!'
Joey	 That\xc2\x92s right, it\xc2\x92s all ruined! You guys ruined everything! You\nruined it! (Steps into the apartment and Chandler closes the door.) (Joey struts over to\nthe candy and starts eating it.)'
Monica	 (To Chandler) Thank you.'
Chandler	 You\xc2\x92re welcome. (They kiss.)'
Monica	 Did you smoke?'
Chandler	 No! Smokes-A-Lot Lady blew smoke directly into my mouth.\nEh-uh\xc2\x97are you okay?'
Monica	 I\xc2\x92m fine now, but it was really scary there for a while. I mean,\nsomeone slipped a-a threatening note under the door.'
Joey	 (with his mouth full) Oh yeah, sorry about that. Mob mentality or\nwhatever, I don\xc2\x92t know\xc2\x85 (Grabs the note.)'

Phoebe	 I can\xc2\x92t believe it! I did it! I rode a bike! I never thought\nI\xc2\x92d be able to do that! Thank you Ross.'
Ross	 Oh hey, don\xc2\x92t thank me, thank yourself. You\xc2\x92re the one who faced\nher fears and ultimately overcame them.'
Phoebe	 Don\xc2\x92t be so corny Ross, it\xc2\x92s not an after-school special. (She\nrides off and the camera pans down to reveal two shiny, silver training wheels firmly\nattached.)'
