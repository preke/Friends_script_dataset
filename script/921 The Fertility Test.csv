Monica	 It's so weird, how did Joey end up kissing Charlie last night? \n  I thought you'd end up kissing Charlie."
Ross	 Hey, I thought I'd end up kissing Charlie too ok? But SURPRISE!"
Chandler	 I missed most of the party (pause) Charlie's a girl, right?"
Ross	 Yes, she is this new professor of my department that I did \n  not kiss.'
Rachel	 I don't know why Joey had to kiss her! I mean, of all the girls \n  at the party, GOD!"
Ross	 Why do you care so much?'
Monica	 Yes Rachel, why do you care so much?'
Rachel	 (worried) Be-cause Ross is the father of my child! You know... \n  and I... want him to hook up with lots of women! (pause) I just... All I'm saying \n  is... I don't think that Joey and Charlie have anything in common."
Ross	 Oh, I don't know, they seem to have a shared interest in each \n  other's tonsils..."
Phoebe	 Wow, Joey and a professor! Can you imagine if they had kids \n  and if the kids got her intelligence and Joey's raw sexual magnetism... Oh, \n  those nerds will get laaaaaid!"
Rachel	 All right, so... Ross, you're ok with all this? I mean..."
Ross	 Yeah, it's no big deal. I mean, I just met her and I'm fine with \n  it..."
Ross	 Oh, God. I forgot how hot she was!'
Joey	 Hey!'
All	 Hi!'
Ross	 I'm gonna get some more coffee."
Charlie	 Oh, you know what? I'll come with you!"
Ross	 Ok. (they both go)'
Chandler	 (to Joey) So, a professor, uh?'
Joey	 Yeah! She is cool, and she\'s so smart! Her mind is totally acrimonious \n  (which, being Joey, he mispronounces "amonious"). (pause) That\'s not \n  how she used it...?'
Charlie	 (talking to Ross) I feel like I owe you an explanation. I don't \n  ordinarily go around kissing guys at parties. I'm... well, I'm kind of embarrassed. \n  I really hope you don't think less of me."
Ross	 Uhm no! Think less of you! No, I don't think less of you. I mean, \n  you saw someone you liked and you kissed them. I mean, those people who like \n  someone and don't kiss them... those-those people are stupid, I hate those people."
Charlie	 You know, actually I'm a little surprised to myself. I mean, \n  Joey is so different from the guys I usually date. I mean, they're all professors, \n  and intellectuals, and paleontologists mostly, you \n  know, very cerebral..."
Ross	 Yeah, I know the type.'
Joey	 Hey, if you wanna grab a bite before work we'd better get acrimonious. \n  No? Am I getting close?"

Phoebe	 (entering) Hey!'
Monica	 Hey!'
Phoebe	 Hey you guys! Look what I just got. (she shows them a pair of \n  slippers)'
Rachel	 Oh, OH! Wow, I love those! Where did you get them?'
Phoebe	 I bought them off Ebay! They used to belong to the late Shania \n  Twain.'
Rachel	 (after a pause) Phoebe, Shania Twain is still alive!'
Phoebe	 Oh... then I overpaid. (she goes to the bathroom)'
Monica	 Hey, what's this?"
Rachel	 Oh, it's a gift certificate to this new SPA in SOHO."
Monica	 Oh, you can't show Phoebe this! She hates those corporate massage \n  chains."
Rachel	 Ah, why, now I can't get a massage? There are so many things \n  that she disapproves of! I can't eat veal, I can't wear fur, I can't go hunting..."
Monica	 Do you wanna go hunting?'
Rachel	 Well, I would like to have the option!!'
Phoebe	 (coming back from the bathroom) What's up? (she sees the gift \n  certificate in Rachel's hands) Hey, Rachel!!"
Rachel	 Oh!'
Phoebe	 No, you can\'t go there! You know how I feel about these "big \n  massage places"! They\'re putting people like me out of business!'
Monica	 And she wants to go hunting, too!!'
Rachel	 Phoebe, come on, I don't wanna waste it! It would be like throwing \n  away a hundred bucks!"
Phoebe	 Ok, this is not about the MONEY, ok? It's about... it's \n  about corporate greed destroying our hearts and leaving us... the hollow shells."
Rachel	 I don't care about any of that!!"
Phoebe	 Well, do you care about friendship?'
Rachel	 Oh!'
Phoebe	 I feel really strongly about this, Rachel. Please, don't use \n  this gift certificate. I'm asking you as a friend."
Rachel	 Oh, not as a friend, Phoebe!! Fine, I won't use it!"
Phoebe	 Promise?'
Rachel	 I promise.'
Phoebe	 Thank you. (she tears up the gift certificate)'
Rachel	 But I am going hunting!!'
Monica	 (entering) Hey honey! I missed you today!'
Chandler	 Oh, yeah?'
Monica	 Yeah. (they kiss) What d'you wanna do tonight?"
Chandler	 Oh, well... Maybe we could... (he sweeps the stuff off the \n  table and wordlessly invites Monica to have sex on it)'
Monica	 Ok, trying to turn me on by making a mess? Know your audience! \n  Besides, tomorrow we're doing those fertility tests and until then you need \n  to keep your tadpoles in the tank."
Chandler	 We really need to take those tests?'
Monica	 Honey, we've been trying to have a baby for over a year. I think \n  it's a good idea to find out if everything's ok. Just a few routine tests."
Chandler	 But I don't wanna do it in a cup!"
Monica	 What is the big deal?'
Chandler	 It's weird! In a doctor's office?"
Monica	 It's not ok to do it in a doctor's office but it is ok to do \n  it in a parked car behind a Taco Bell?"
Chandler	 (embarrassed) I cannot believe Ross told you that! (pause) \n  And in my defense, it was a Wendy's!"
Monica	 Look, I don't wanna do this test either, but I really do think \n  it's a good idea!"
Chandler	 Yeah, ok. I'm sure that doctor's office can't be worst than \n  on a class trip to the Hershey's factory!"
Monica	 (really embarrassed) OH!'
Chandler	 Oh, yeah! RACHEL TALKS TOO!'
Joey	 (sipping red wine from a glass) Who says that wine has to cost \n  more than milk!'
Joey	 Heeey!'
Charlie	 Hi!'
Joey	 Come on in, how are ya?'
Charlie	 I'm good!"
Joey	 Can I offer you a drink?'
Charlie	 Please, I've been crazed all day! I had a meeting with \n  the Dean, and my syllabus for summer school is due and I'm writing the Foreword \n  for a friend's book..."
Joey	 Uh-oh. I hade a pretty hectic day at work too, today I had to \n  open a door and go (looking scared) ohhhh!'
Charlie	 So I am just so excited to be \n  here. And I can't wait to start exploring the city!"
Joey	 Hey, if you need a tour guide... (point to himself)'
Charlie	 Oh, you mean it? That would be so fun!'
Joey	 Yeah, definitely, definitely. Ok, what do you wanna see first?'
Charlie	 Oh, well, we can go see the Chronos Quartet at the Avery Fisher \n  Hall.'
Joey	 (looking puzzled and nodding) Ok!'
Charlie	 And there is a collection of Walt Whitman letters on display \n  at the public library.'
Joey	 I know, yeah!'
Charlie	 And first, I have to see the MET!'
Joey	 Ok, let me stop you right there. The Mets suck, ok? You wanna \n  see the Yankees.'
Charlie	 No, no, no, not the Mets, the MET, singular!'
Joey	 Which one, they all suck!'
Charlie	 The museum!'
Joey	 (looking puzzled) I don't think so."
Rachel	 (to the receptionist) Hi there!'
Receptionist	 (in an affected tone) Hello, welcome to Lavender Day Spa \n  SPA. How may I help you?'
Rachel	 Oh, hi. I have a massage appointment under Rachel Green, and \n  here is my gift certificate.'
Receptionist	 This has been torn up.'
Rachel	 And... taped back together.'
Receptionist	 Ok well, I'll call you as \n  soon as your massage therapist is ready."
Rachel	 Ok'
Receptionist	 Have a seat through the glass doors.'
Rachel	 (imitating the receptionist's tone) through the glass doors."
Receptionist	 Through the glass doors.'
Rachel	 Alright-y then.'
Receptionist	 Phoebe, your next client's in the waiting room."
Phoebe	 Ok. Do we have to talk like that then they're not around? (She \n  sees Rachel) Oh, no, no! Listen, is there someone \n  who can fill in for me?"
Receptionist	 Sorry, everyone is booked!'
Phoebe	 But that woman can't know I work \n  here. She's a friend of mine and I made this big stink about how awful this \n  massage chains are."
Receptionist	 Then why you work here?'
Phoebe	 'Cause it's good money! But that doesn't change the fact that \n  this is an evil blood sucking corporate machine!"
Receptionist	 Well, I think this is a great place to work!'
Phoebe	 (watching around and whispering) Ok, are they listening?'
Joey	 Ross!'
Ross	 Hi!'
Joey	 I need to talk to you about Charlie.'
Ross	 (annoyed) Oh, do you, do you really?'
Joey	 Yeah, I'm... I'm kind of having a little problem."
Ross	 Look, if you don\'t know what the word "acrimonious" \n  means, just don\'t use it!'
Joey	 No, look, you know Charlie, right? She's cool, she's funny, her \n  body is soo..."
Ross	 Get to the problem!'
Joey	 Yes. It's just that she's so much smarter than all the girls I've \n  ever dated! Combined! I don't want her to think I'm stupid!"
Ross	 (looking down) Are you wearing two belts?'
Joey	 (checking) EH, what do you know!'
Ross	 You were saying you didn't want to seem stupid."
Joey	 Right, right, right, well, she wants to go to all this cultural \n  places and I don't know how to talk about that stuff. You gotta help me out!"
Ross	 You know, I really don't want to \n  get involved in you guy's relationship."
Joey	 Please, c'mon, you're the smartest person I know and I really \n  like this girl, ok, I don't wanna lose her."
Ross	 (after a short hesitation) Fine.'
Joey	 Thanks.'
Ross	 Ok. Let's see. Oh, you should take her to the MET!"
Joey	 The Metsss!'
Ross	 Oh, no! The MET! The Metropolitan Museum of Art.'
Joey	 (realizing) Oh, that's what she meant! (pause) You know, if they're \n  gonna shorten it, they should call it the MUSE! You know, short for museum, \n  and avoid all the confusion!"
Ross	 Yeah, most of it it's a place  packed with confused angry \n  baseball fans!"
Joey	 Ok, all right, so I'll take her to the MET."
Ross	 Yeah, uh, uh, ok, there's this great rare bookstore \n  on Madison Avenue. You know what? She loves architecture, \n  you know what you should do? You should take a walk down fifth to the \n  Saint Patrick's Cathedral and there there's this great little pastry shop that \n  she'd love."
Joey	 Geez, sounds like you should be going on this date!'
Ross	 But I'm not! (pause). You know what if you're in the mood for \n  Thai food..."
Joey	 Whoa, whoa, whoa! Slow down, you go way too \n  fast. Ok? Just go back to the MET, ok?'
Ross	 Ok.'
Joey	 You got to tell me exactly what to do there.'
Ross	 Ok, when you walk in the museum, take the right, that's the antiquities \n  wing. Ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, up to the Byzantine Empire."
Joey	 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! So, I walk in the door and make \n  the right (and he bends his arm to the left. Ross then bends Joey's arm to the \n  right and Joey nods)"
Chandler	 I have a weird feeling about this place. (pause) How do I \n  know that they are not gonna secretly videotape me and put it all over the internet.'
Monica	 Because, honey, I mean this in the sweetest way possible, nobody \n  is gonna wanna watch that.'
Nurse	 Mr. Bing? (Chandler jumps up) Here you are! You'll go into that \n  room and deposit your specimen into the container."
Chandler	 Deposit my specimen? You know, \n  usually I have to call a  900 number for that kind \n  of talk. Thanks, got it.'
Monica	 Hey, honey, my test is down the hall, are you sure you're going \n  to be ok?"
Chandler	 Yeah, I guess!'
Monica	 I know this is embarrassing, but nobody cares! No one here even \n  knows you!'
Janice	 OH MY GOD!!'
Chandler	 Oh, Come on!'

Janice	 Ah ahahahhahaa! How great is this!'
Monica	 Hey, we're probably fertile, let's go home!"
Chandler	 Why are you here?'
Janice	 Well, Sid and I are trying again and we had trouble last time \n  because apparently we...'
Chandler	 (to Heaven) No no no... I mean, why? why is \n  she here??'
Janice	 Oh! Someone's a little cranky today cuz \n  they have to do it in a cup! (laughs) Oh! They gave you the kiddy size (looking \n  at the cup in his hand)."
Chandler	 What!?'
Monica	 This was fun! But I've got an invasive vaginal exam to get to! \n  (leaves)"
Chandler	 I'd love to stay, but I have eh... (points at the cup) got \n  a hot date... (starts to leave)"
Janice	 Please... go! (Then shouts after him) Just let me know if you \n  need a hand!'
Chandler	 (disgusted) I think it just fell off. (Leaves)'
Phoebe	 (In a strange heavy accent) Hello "ja", it\'s time \n  for your massage, ja! Put your face in the hole.'
Rachel	 Wow, a Swedish massage from a real Swedish person. (Puts her \n  head in the hole and Phoebe enters)'
Phoebe	 Okay, then I'm Swedish..."
Monica	 So, what's your name?"
Phoebe	 It's a normal Swedish name... Ikea..."
Rachel	 Oh... what an interesting name.'
Phoebe	 Ja!'
Rachel	 You know I... (lifts her head and tries to look in Phoebe's \n  direction)"
Phoebe	 (pushes her head back down) Time for your scalp massage!'
Rachel	 (Sees Phoebe's slippers through the hole) Wow... I really love \n  your... (startled as she realizes those are Phoebe's slippers)"
Phoebe	 Is something wrong?'
Rachel	 No, it's just that uhm... it feels so good... Ikea... (pause) \n  Yeah, say hey, you'll know this, what's the capital of Sweden?"
Phoebe	 (Thinks for a few moments) Uhm... Stockholm.'
Rachel	 Damn! I wish I knew if that was right!'
Joey	 (gesturing at an imaginary painting) Note the painterly \n  lines and subtle impasto on this canvas. Monet painted quickly and usually outdoors \n  as his elusive subject was light itself.'
Ross	 Now, do you have any idea what you just said?'
Joey	 (shaking his head as if to say
Ross	 Ok now, remember, when you get to the museum, Monet is not spelt \n  M-O-N-A-Y. I just... I wrote that out phonetically for you.'
Joey	 Phonetically? (Looks confused)'
Ross	 Yeah, yeah that means... you know? We just... we don't have time \n  for this."
Joey	 Ok.'
Ross	 Ok, but you know what? I gotta say, \n  I'm really impressed that you were able to memorize all this so quickly!"
Joey	 Ah! I\'m an actor! I can memorize anything! Last week on "Days" \n  I had to say "Frontal temporal zygomatic craniotomy".'
Ross	 Wow. What does that mean?'
Joey	 No idea! But the guy I said it to dies in the next scene so I \n  guess it means "you\'re gonna get eaten by a bear".'
Ross	 Ok! So let's move on to the Renaissance?"
Joey	 Ok, Caravaggio uses chiaroscuro here to highlight the anguish \n  of the central figure. Touch it, it's really bumpy! (Reaches out to touch the \n  imaginary painting)."
Ross	 Nah ah! Nah ah! (stops him form doing so) No no no! No ad-libbing \n  and dude, you can't touch the paintings."
Joey	 Come on! you... (reaches out to touch the imaginary painting again)'
Ross	 No! (Slaps his hand)'
Chandler	 (To the nurse at the nurses' station) My specimen is in the \n  room and I just want to thank whoever knocked on the door while I was in there. \n  Really helped speed the process along! (walks towards the common area and sees \n  Janice is still there) Janice! You're not... gone?"
Janice	 Oh! Sid is still in his room. I don't allow porn at home so \n  this is like a vacation for him. So did you do it? Did you make your deposit?"
Chandler	 Yeah! yeah... The hard part is over!'
Janice	 That's not the hard part honey! The hard part is what comes \n  next, I mean aren't you worried about the results?"
Chandler	 I haven't... I haven't even thought about the results yet... \n  I just assumed that everything was gonna be ok."
Janice	 Oh! Well, you know what? It probably is.'
Chandler	 (Slightly panicky) Yeah, but what if it's not? What if there \n  is a reason why we can't have a baby?"
Janice	 Oh, Chandler, look. You and Monica are meant to have children. \n  I am sure it's gonna be just fine."
Chandler	 (smiling again) oh, oh, yeah, ok, thanks. I can't believe \n  I didn't even think of that. I guess I was just so worried about having to... \n  come here and do... 'that'..."
Janice	 What, you can do it in the parking lot of a Taco Bell, but you \n  can't do it at a doctor's office?"
Chandler	 (stares at her intently, then yells) It was a "Wendy\'s!! \n  "'
Phoebe	 (Singing) "Ipan Stripan, Glupi Glabi! " And that is \n  the Swedish National Anthem! Thank you for asking! (looks annoyed)'
Rachel	 Wow, Ikea... what a rich culture. Uhm, you know what? I have \n  a friend who is a masseuse.'
Phoebe	 Oh, Ja! Ja!'
Rachel	 Yah! She's... uhm... not very good though... (Phoebe looks devastated)"
Phoebe	 Uhu, uhu... and why do you think that is?'
Rachel	 I don't know... maybe it's because she has got such callousy \n  fingers from playing crummy guitar..."
Phoebe	 Or... maybe she has trouble loosening your knots because you're \n  such a high maintenance tight ass!"
Rachel	 (now lifts her head) Phoebe!!'
Phoebe	 You know it's me?"
Rachel	 For like a half an hour! Man, you can lie about Sweden!'
Phoebe	 How can you come here?'
Rachel	 How could you not tell me you worked here?'
Phoebe	 I don't have to tell you everything!"
Rachel	 Yes you do, if you're going to make me feel guilty for getting \n  a free massage!"
Phoebe	 Tips not included.'
Rachel	 Oh! Phoebe, why did you lie to me about working here?'
Phoebe	 Because I was ashamed ok? I sold out for the cash! And then \n  they give me benefits like medical, and dental, and a 401K. But you know... \n  you pay a price. Now I'm this Corporate stooge and punching a clock and Ugh! \n  paying taxes!"
Rachel	 Phoebe, honey, if you hate it so much, you should walk out there \n  right now and quit! Be true to what you believe in! Honey, you have principles \n  and I so admire that! I don't have any!"
Phoebe	 You know what? You are right. I am gonna quit. It's time \n  I took my life back!"
Rachel	 Good for you Pheebs!'
Phoebe	 Ok.'
Phoebe	 Okay (walks out and closes the door behind her, looks up and \n  whispers) If you guys have microphones in there too, I didn't mean any \n  of that. I love you."
Ross	 Haha! Got ya! Die, die, die!'
Ross	 (recovers his composure and starts typing) Respectfully, professor \n  R. Geller. (hits <return>, closes the laptop and joins Charlie on the \n  sofa) Hey!'
Charlie	 Hi!'
Ross	 Hey, how was the Met?'
Charlie	 The museum was amazing!'
Ross	 Yeah? Joey really knows his art, huh?'
Charlie	 Not so much, no. He had clearly memorized all the stuff to \n  say, and some of it didn't even make any sense."
Ross	 What do you mean?'
Charlie	 Well, for one, he was talking about paintings that were nowhere \n  around.'
Ross	 (perplexed for a moment) Wait a minute... when you guys walked \n  into the Met, did you go to the right?'
Charlie	 No, we went to the left.'
Ross	 (shaking head) Oh Joey, Joey! But still, I mean, it seems like \n  you guys are having a great time together.'
Charlie	 Yeah, it's fun (hesitating)."
Ross	 What?'
Charlie	 Actually, you know, Joey is your friend, and you don't really \n  know me that well; it would be weird."
Ross	 What, I mean, a little, but no, what, go on.'
Charlie	 Well... I'm just thinking that maybe he's not the right guy \n  to be with right now, maybe I should be with someone... I have more in common \n  with. You know what I mean?"
Ross	 (slowly) Yeah. But you know what? I think you should give Joey \n  a chance. I mean, he's a great guy, and sure he doesn't know that much about \n  art but you know, you can always talk about that with someone else."
Charlie	 Yeah, I guess that's true."
Ross	 And if you think about it, I mean the reason he memorized all \n  that stuff is because he thought it was important to you. You \n  know, that's the kind of guy Joey is."
Charlie	 He is very sweet. Plus he's hot!"
Ross	 That was going to be my next argument.'
Joey	 Hey!'
Ross	 Hey!'
Charlie	 Hey!'
Joey	 (to Charlie) You're ready?"
Charlie	 Yeah, let's go. (stands up and kisses Joey) (to Ross) Thanks \n  Ross."
Joey	 (aside, to Ross) Hey Ross! That art stuff worked, you hooked me \n  up.'
Ross	 Glad I could help man.'
Joey	 Although some of that stuff wasn't where you said it was gonna \n  be, but... (confidently) I made it work."
Chandler	 (picking up a plastic cup similar to the one he deposited \n  his specimen in) It is not okay that I'm aroused by this now."
Chandler	 Hello? Oh hi, Doctor Connelly. (pause) No, she's not here \n  but, you know, I can tell her. Should I be sitting down for this? (his smile \n  fades as he hears the answer) Oh. (pause) Well, so what does that mean? (pause) \n  Ok. Ok, thank you. Thanks. (hangs up)"
Monica	 Hey sweetie.'
Chandler	 Doctor Connelly just called.'
Monica	 With good news? (very quickly and wringing hands) Of course \n  it is not good news, you just said (deadpan) "Doctor Connelly just called". \n  If it was good news you would have said (excitedly) "Doctor Connelly just \n  called! " But so what is it? Is there a problem, uh? Is there a problem \n  with me or with you?'
Chandler	 Actually it's both of us."
Monica	 What?'
Chandler	 Apparently my sperm have low motility and you have an inhospitable \n  environment.'
Monica	 Oh... what does that mean?'
Chandler	 It means that my guys won't get off their barcaloungers \n  and you have a uterus that is prepared to kill the ones that do. (pause) It \n  means..."
Monica	 Chandler?'
Chandler	 (seriously) It means that we can keep trying, but there's \n  a good chance this may never happen for us."
Monica	 (weeping) Oh my God!'
Chandler	 I'm sorry."
Monica	 I'm sorry too."
Chandler	 Well, we're gonna... we're gonna figure this out."
Monica	 (still weeping) I know.'

Receptionist	 Good morning Phoebe.'
Phoebe	 (imitating the receptionist's tone) Good morning receptionist."
Receptionist	 Here's your schedule for the day. Your first client is \n  in room No. 1."
Phoebe	 Rachel Green? (angrily) Son of a bitch, she came back?'
Phoebe	 (through the door, with a Scottish accent) Are you ready for \n  your Scottish massage? Put your face in the hole, lassy.'
