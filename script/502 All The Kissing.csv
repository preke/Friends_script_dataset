Rachel	 Oh no, you're the best."
Ross	 (breaking the hug) Ohh, I gotta go to the flower store! (Runs to the\ndoor.) Check it out, no one will tell me where Emily is, so I'm gonna send 72 long-stem,\nred roses to Emily's parent's house, one for each day that I've known and loved her. That\noughta get her talking to me again."

Rachel	 What?! I didn\'t have a good time in Greece! Ross abandoned me! Okay, I\ncouldn\'t get a plane out, so I had to stay in their honeymoon suite with people coming up\nto me all the time going, "Oh, Mrs. Geller, why are you crying?" I mean, it was\nsooo humiliating. I felt like such an idiot! I mean, it\'s all my fault! And you know why,\nbecause I make very bad decisions.'
Chandler	 Oh that's not true."
Rachel	 Yes it is! It is true! I went, I went after Ross in stupid London.'
Phoebe	 London is stupid! Stupid!'
Rachel	 Phoebe, you were right. I should've never gone to London, and from now\non you make all of my decisions for me."
Phoebe	 Oh\xc2\x85 No, I did that for someone once and I'm not comfortable having\nthat kind of power and control over someone's life."
Monica	 I'll do it!"
Rachel	 That's fine. So Monica, you are now in control of my love life."
Chandler	 Okay, I gotta go to work.'
Chandler	 And uh, Rachel, glad to have you back. '

Monica	 Sweetie! Edges! Fingers! Smudgey! Pictures!'
Rachel	 Oh my God! (She licks the top picture and hands them back.)'
Monica	 Okay. That's okay. I-I know that you're very upset right now. I know, I\nknow that wasn't about me."
Joey	 (To Chandler) I bet it was about her a little.'
Monica	 If you would stop thinking about Ross for one minute you would notice\nthat there are great guys everywhere! I mean, look! Look, Gunther! (Gunther turns to\nlisten in.) I mean, he's nice, he's cute."
Rachel	 Yeah, I guess Gunther is kinda\xc2\x85'
Monica	 (Interrupting) Oh, what about that guy over there? (She points at\nanother guy and Gunther is deflated.) Remember? That is the guy you flirted with at\nthe counter that time.'
Rachel	 Oh, I don't know. I don't know."
Monica	 You're going to talk to him! Y'know what? We made a deal, I make your\ndecisions and I say you're going to talk to him."

Phoebe	 (Grabs the pictures) Oh! Here we all are! Yeah, there's Ross and\nJoey and you and me. (She picks up a magic marker and draws herself in. Monica can't\nwatch.)"
Chandler	 All right, y'know what, we've been talking about London too much\nhaven't we?"
Phoebe	 No. I'm sorry. It's just 'cause I couldn't be there. 'Cause all I ever\nget to do now is pregnant stuff, it just bums me out."
All	 Sorry.'
Monica	 What happened?'
Rachel	 Well, y'know, a little of this, a little of that. Got myself a date\ntomorrow night."

Chandler	 I got caught up and work, but I'm quitting tomorrow."
Monica	 Oh, good. '
Chandler	 So, thanks for having me over! Rach. (Goes over, grabs her, and kisses\nher.) Pheebs. (After a moment while he decides how to kiss her around her belly, grabs her\nand kisses her.)'
Joey	 (Jumping out of his way) See ya!! (To the girls.) What the hell was that?!'
Monica	 Probably some y'know, European good-bye thing he picked up in London."
Rachel	 That's not European!"
Phoebe	 Well, it felt French.'
Rachel	 Oh God, I really had a good time!'
Dave	 Yeah, me too. (They reach her door.) So, I guess this is it.'
Rachel	 Yeah. Umm, unless you wanna come inside?'
Dave	 Yeah!'
Rachel	 Okay. Oh, uh, wait a minute, y'know what? I uh, I can't decide this.\nUmm, okay, just hold on a second."
Dave	 Okay, yeah!'
Rachel	 Umm, hi!'
Ross	 Hi.'
Rachel	 Is Monica around? I-I have to ask her something.'
Ross	 She's doing her laundry."
Rachel	 What's that? (Points to the box.)"
Ross	 It came in the mail today, it's uh, 72 long-stemmed red roses, one for\neach day that I've known and loved Emily, cut up into mulch!"
Rachel	 Oh, honey that's awful."
Ross	 Oh, it's not so bad. Monica's gonna make potpourri! I think I'm gonna go\nwander out in the rain for a while."
Rachel	 But, it's not raining."
Ross	 I can't catch a break!"
Rachel	 Y'know what Ross? You're not going anywhere. You're gonna sit right\nhere. I'm gonna make you a cup of tea and we're gonna talk this thing whole out. All\nright? (She goes out to talk to Dave) Hey, Dave!"
Dave	 Yeah?'
Rachel	 Umm, listen, I'm gonna need to take a rain check, my roommate is just\nreally sick. Okay? Bye! (She goes back in to talk to Ross.) Honey, listen, I know, I know\nthings seem so bad right now."
Monica	 (Poking her head in) Rach? Can I talk to for just a minute? I-I dropped\nsome socks.'
Rachel	 Yeah. (She goes out to join her in the hall and starts looking for the\ndropped socks.)'
Monica	 What is the matter with you?! Do you want to fall into the trap? Do you\nwant to fall into the trap?!'
Rachel	 Ohh! You did not drop any socks!'
Monica	 I just ran into Dave and he told me that you blew him off! I mean, you\nlisten to me! Now, I'm calling the shots! I say you leave Ross alone and go get Dave! What\nthe hell were you trying to do?"
Rachel	 Well, ultimately, I was trying y'know, I-I wanted\xc2\x85tell him y'know,\nthat I'm still in love with him."
Monica	 (Gasps) What?!! You cannot tell him that!!'
Rachel	 Why? Why not?! People love to hear that!'
Monica	 I make the decisions, and I say no.'
Rachel	 Well, y'know what, no, you do not make my decisions because y'know what,\nyou're fired."
Monica	 You can\'t fire me. I make your decisions and I say,\n"I\'m not fired!" Ha!'
Rachel	 Well\xc2\x85 (At a loss for words, she grabs some of Monica's laundry and\nthrows it on the floor as a diversion to allow Rachel to run back inside and close the\ndoor. Monica chases her to find that Rachel had locked the door.)"
Monica	 Rachel!! Come on! Let me in!'
Joey	 (Poking his head out.) Havin' some trouble?"
Monica	 Rachel locked the door.'
Joey	 I'll kick that door in if you give me a little sugar."

Monica	 Rachel! Let me in! Rachel!'
Monica	 Thank you. Rachel, can I talk to you outside for a sec?'
Rachel	 No.'
Monica	 I really need to talk to you.'
Rachel	 Well, then talk!'
Monica	 Okay, I will. Remember that thing that we just discussed that you wanted\nto do?'
Rachel	 Yes!'
Ross	 What thing?'
Monica	 Well, Rachel wants to take swing dance lessons. Which I think is a\nreally stupid idea! It's dangerous, she's never gonna get what she wants, and who knows\nwho she might (Turns to look at Ross) end up hurting."
Ross	 Monica's right, swing dancing can be tricky. I'm gonna use the phone. I\ngotta cancel those five giant teddy bears I sent to Emily. (Looks at the rose mulch.) My\nGod, think of the massacre."
Rachel	 I'm gonna do it."
Monica	 All right, Rachel, I know-I know you think I'm crazy, please, before you\ntell him you love him, just-just try to find one person who thinks this is a good idea.\nBecause I bet you, you can't."
Rachel	 But I\xc2\x85'
Monica	 Please!'
Rachel	 All right, fine.'
Monica	 Joey, I'm in!"
Joey	 (In tremendous pain) All right. Good deal.'
All	 Pheebs! Hey Pheebs!'
Joey	 Uh, okay, Pheebs?'
Phoebe	 Yeah?'
Joey	 Umm, y'know how the other day you were talking about how you didn't get to\ngo to London and how you were kinda feeling left out?"
Phoebe	 Yeah?'
Joey	 All right, well, we felt really bad about that so we decided we should all\ntake a little trip together!'
Phoebe	 Ohh, that's so nice! How great! Well, where? Where's the trip?!"
Monica	 Well, we thought we would all go to a picnic (Phoebe gasps), in Central\nPark!'
Phoebe	 (excited) Central\xc2\x85(not so excited) Park!'
Joey	 Yeah, all of us! All day!'
Phoebe	 That sucks! That\'s not a trip! I just came from the park! What are we\ngonna high five about at the stupid Central Park? "Well, it\'s right by my house, all\nright!" '
Chandler	 Well, I'm gonna go home and bask in the triumph of my Central Park\nidea. (Gets up to leave.)"
Rachel	 (stopping him) Hey-whoa-whoa-whoa!! Ho-ho-hold on a sec there, Mr.\nKissey! Y'know, I've been meaning to talk to you about this whole, little, new European\nthing you got going on, and I just need to tell you that it makes me very uncomfortable\nand I just\xc2\x97y'know\xc2\x97stop it!"
Chandler	 I was just trying to bring a little culture to the group.'
Phoebe	 That's fine, just don't bring it in my mouth."
Monica	 Makes me wanna puke! (Chandler looks at her, quizzically.) '
Ross	 Hey everybody, Pheebs is here!'
Joey	 Phoebe!'
Chandler	 Hey, Pheebs!'
Rachel	 Phoebe, woo!'
Phoebe	 Okay, woo! Hi.'
Chandler	 Okay, Pheebs, we decided the picnic idea was a little\xc2\x85 Y'know, it\ndidn't have any\xc2\x85 It-it, well it blew. So, we thought, that this afternoon that we\nwould all go away for the whole weekend to, Atlantic City!"
Phoebe	 Ooh, Atlantic City! Oh, that's a great plan! Who's plan was that?"
Joey	 Mine!'
Ross	 Wait! It was my plan.'
Joey	 Nooo, I said we needed a new plan.'
Ross	 And, I came up with Atlantic City.'
Joey	 Which, is the new plan!'
Monica	 Okay, well, why don't we all meet upstairs in an hour?"
Phoebe	 Okay! Ooh-ahh, I'm gonna go pack. I'm gonna go pack my ass off!"
Monica	 Come on Rach, let's go."
Rachel	 Yeah, y'know what? I'm-I'm gonna meet you upstairs in a minute."
Monica	 No! Rachel, you didn't find anyone so you can't tell him."
Rachel	 Well, y'know what, that doesn't matter."
Monica	 Okay, Rachel, do you have any idea how painful it is to tell someone\nthat you love them and not have them say it back?'
Rachel	 Yeah, I-I don't care."
Monica	 Okay. I-I can't watch. (Leaves as sits down to read the paper.)"
Rachel	 What 'cha readin'?"
Ross	 The paper.'
Rachel	 Yeah, what's it about?"
Ross	 Events from around the globe.'
Rachel	 Okay. Uhh, Ross, y'know what, there's something that I-that I have to\ntalk to you about and everybody's saying that I shouldn't tell you, but I think they're\nwrong. I mean, and you know how people can be wrong."
Ross	 Sure. Once, at work I-I thought carbon dating was fossilized\xc2\x85'
Rachel	 Okay, Ross, I'm really trying to tell you something here."
Ross	 Yeah. '
Rachel	 Okay.'
Ross	 Go ahead.'
Rachel	 Umm, okay, I think I'm-I'm just gonna-just gonna say it. Just gonna say\nit. Uhh, (pause) I'm still in love with you Ross."
Ross	 Wow. Umm\xc2\x85 Huh\xc2\x85 I'm-I'm not sure what to do with that right now."
Ross	 What? What? Was that a joke? 'Cause it's mean."
Rachel	 (Laughing) I'm so dead serious. I'm totally serious."
Ross	 Why are you laughing?'
Rachel	 Because (laughs), because, I just heard it. I heard it, and it\'s\nridiculous! I mean, you\'re married. You\'re-you\'re married and it\'s just ridiculous, and\nit\'s like, it\'s like when said it, I sort of like, I floated up out of my body, y\'know?\nAnd, and-and then I heard myself say it and then the floating Rachel (laughs) was like,\n"You are such an idiot!"'
Ross	 Well, well I am married. Even though I haven't spoken to my wife\nsince the wedding."
Rachel	 (laughs) I'm sorry, that's not funny."
Ross	 Actually, it kinda is. My wife won\'t return my calls. I don\'t know where\nmy wife is. (Laughs) "Hey Ross, where\'s the Mrs.?" Don\'t know! '
Rachel	 Oh God, ohh, okay, y'know what, do you think ah, do you think that you\njust forget that I told you this?"
Ross	 Well, I kinda half to. I mean, because the thing is\xc2\x85'
Rachel	 The thing is y'know, that you're married to Emily."
Ross	 That is what the thing is.'
Rachel	 Ross, things aren't gonna be weird between us, right? I mean was that\njust the stupidest thing, me telling you that?"
Ross	 No. No. No, I'm-I'm glad you did. Look, if nothing else, it's-it's always\ngreat when someone tells you they love you."
Rachel	 That's what I said! Thank you for being so nice. (They hug.)"
Ross	 No thank you for\xc2\x85 Thank you.'
Ross	 Okay, let's go!"

Joey	 Uh, Pheebs, you're leaking?"
Monica	 Oh my God! You're water broke!"
The Guys	 Ohh!'
Phoebe	 All right. Well, don't worry, I call shotgun! (She starts out the door.)"
All	 Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! Wait-wait!'
Chandler	 Pheebs! We have to take you to the hospital now!'
Ross	 Pheebs, Pheebs, the babies are coming now.'
Rachel	 High-five, the babies are coming! (They all high-five.)'
Phoebe	 Wait, wait, remember when my water broke? (They all high-five again.)'

Monica	 I can't believe Phoebe's gonna have her babies!"
Chandler	 I know, it's beautiful. Amazing."
Chandler	 Y'know what else I can't believe? I had to kiss Phoebe and Rachel\nevery time I left a room, I mean it's too bad they didn't see us having sex."
Monica	 Do you know anything about women?'
Chandler	 No.'
Monica	 That's all right. "
Chandler	 Okay. (They kiss again.)'
