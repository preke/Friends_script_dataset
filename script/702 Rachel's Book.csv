Joey	 Hey!'
Ross	 Hi!'
Joey	 Who wants French toast?'
Ross	 Oh, I\xc2\x92ll have some!'
Joey	 Good, me too. (Tosses him the loaf.) Eggs and milk are in the fridge.\nThanks.'
Monica	 (entering from her room) Oww!'
Chandler	 What\xc2\x92s the matter honey?'
Monica	 I don\xc2\x92t know, my hand feels weird. I guess it\xc2\x92s because,\nI\xc2\x92m engaged! (Shows off the ring.) How long before it starts getting annoying?'
Phoebe	 It starts?'
Rachel	 Yeah, so let\xc2\x92s get started on the wedding plans!'
Monica	 Okay! (Runs off.)'
Chandler	 (incredulous) Already?!'
Rachel	 Yeah, we got a lot to do! We gotta think about the flowers, the\ncaterers, the music\xc2\x85'
Chandler	 Oh, I got some thoughts on that.'
Rachel	 Oh wait Chandler, too many cooks\xc2\x85'
Ross	 Take from me, as the groom all you have to do is show up and try to say\nthe right name.'
Monica	 (returning) Okay! (Sets down a huge 3" 3-ring binder on the table.)'
Chandler	 What in God\xc2\x92s name is that?!'
Ross	 Oh my God, the wedding book?! I haven\xc2\x92t seen that since the forth\ngrade!'
Monica	 This baby has got everything. Take y\xc2\x92know, locations for instance.\n(She opens up the binder to the locations chapter.) First, organized alphabetically, then\ngeographically, then by square footage. '
Phoebe	 That is so smart! (To Chandler, under her breath) Break it off. Break it\noff now.'

Ross	 And that should conclusively prove that I had the idea for Jurassic\nPark first! Now let\xc2\x92s take a look at\xc2\x85 (Phoebe rushes in.)'
Phoebe	 Hey! Ross!'
Ross	 Phoebe, oh my God! Wh-wh-what are you doing here?'
Phoebe	 I need to talk to you, it\xc2\x92s pretty urgent. It\xc2\x92s about Monica\nand Chandler.'
Ross	 Oh my God! Of course, of course. (To the class.) Umm, would you please\nexcuse me for a moment? Umm, do you know each other\xc2\x92s hometowns? Why don\xc2\x92t\nyou\xc2\x85 (Motions that they should learn everyone\xc2\x92s hometown.) (To Phoebe)\nWh-what\xc2\x92s going on?'
Phoebe	 Well, umm, not much. But, I was just thinking that since those guys just\ngot engaged that maybe it would be nice if they had some privacy, y\xc2\x92know? So, could I\njust move in with you for a couple days?'
Ross	 Umm, okay, yeah, sure. But wh-what\xc2\x92s wrong with Monica and Chandler?'
Phoebe	 Nothing\xc2\x97Why?!'
Ross	 Phoebe, you said it was urgent!'
Phoebe	 Oh yeah it is! I\xc2\x92m going to the movies and it starts in like five\nminutes.'
Ross	 Do you realize I have a classroom full of students?'
Phoebe	 (to the students) Oh, I\xc2\x92m sorry. I\xc2\x92m so rude. Does anyone want\nto come to the movies?'
Monica	 All right, so I haven\xc2\x92t cleared the budget with my parents yet, but\ntell me how this is for music.'
Rachel	 Okay.'
Monica	 All right umm, a string quartet for the procession.'
Rachel	 Aw.'
Monica	 A jazz trio for cocktails. The Bay City Rollers for dancing.\nWait, that was from my sixth grade wedding.'
Chandler	 Well, you couldn\xc2\x92t get them anyway. Ian doesn\xc2\x92t plan anymore\nand Derrick\xc2\x85 (Off of Rachel and Monica\xc2\x92s looks) And Derrick is a name I\nshouldn\xc2\x92t know.'
Joey	 (sitting up from the couch) Hey Mon, do you have another pillow? (Holds up\none.) Y\xc2\x92know, something a little snugglyer?'
Chandler	 Why are you napping over here instead of over at your place?'
Joey	 Well, the duck\xc2\x85'
Rachel	 What?! The duck?! What the hell did the damn duck do now?!'
Joey	 Uh, well he did not get sick somewhere in there and it was\nimmediately found and properly cleaned up!'
Chandler	 Now, do I get to look at this book or is it just for people who are\nactually involved in the wedding?'
Monica	 Of course you can look at it! Yeah, I want your opinion too!'
Chandler	 Okay.'
Monica	 Here you go! What do you think about centerpieces?'
Chandler	 Centerpieces!'
Monica	 Yeah! Roses or Lilies? (Holds up a picture of each.)'
Chandler	 Definitely roses. (Monica and Rachel exchange a look.) Well, I just\nthink they\xc2\x92re a little more weddingy. (Monica holds the Lily picture closer to him.)\nBut Lilies are the clear choice.'
Monica	 Oh my God! It\xc2\x92s like one mind.'
Chandler	 Uh-huh!'
Joey	 (sitting up again) Guys! Guys!! You gotta let me nap! Ugh, I\xc2\x92m\ngonna get cranky!'
Rachel	 Joey, there is a perfectly good couch across the hall!'
Joey	 Yes it is perfectly good, and it is not one of the places the duck\ngot sick!'
Rachel	 What?!'
Joey	 All right, I\xc2\x92m gonna go! (Gets up and heads for the door.)'
Rachel	 Now Joey, what did the duck do?!'
Joey	 I don\xc2\x92t know! But he did not eat your face cream!'
Joey	 Hey little buddy, how are you feeling? (The duck does not get sick\nand Joey recoils in horror and heads for the couch.) What the hell is in that face cream?\n(He\xc2\x92s about to try out the couch but notices the bed in Rachel\xc2\x92s room. He walks\ninto her room and feels the bed.) That\xc2\x92s so soft. (He pulls back the comforter.)\nPillowcases! (He climbs in and groans in delight. Suddenly, he feels something under him\nand pulls out a little beat up paperback book. He opens it and starts to read from it.)\n(In his head.) Zelda looked at the chimney sweep. Her father, the vicar\xc2\x85(Stops\nreading and thinks.) The vicar? (Continues reading) \xc2\x85wouldn\xc2\x92t be home\nfor hours. Her loins were burning. She threw caution to the wind and reached out and\ngrabbed his\xc2\x85(Out loud.) Whoa! (Reads on in silence.) Whoa-ho-ho-ho! This is a\ndirty book! (Continues to read.)'
Ross	 Uh, Phoebe\xc2\x85'
Phoebe	 Oh Ross, hi.'
Ross	 Phoebe, what are you doing?'
Phoebe	 I\xc2\x92m sorry, I\xc2\x92m with a client right now.'
Ross	 Phoebe!'
Phoebe	 Okay, let\xc2\x92s talk outside.'
Ross	 Phoebe, you can\xc2\x92t massage people in my apartment!'
Phoebe	 What\xc2\x92s the big deal? I did it at Monica and Chandler\xc2\x92s!'
Ross	 And they knew about it?'
Phoebe	 (pause as she considers it) Okay, well Ross, what is this really about?'
Ross	 Look, this is my home and I want to be able to come and go whenever I\nwant!'
Phoebe	 Okay, I will find someplace else to do the rest of my appointments. I\njust don\xc2\x92t know what the big deal is!'
Ross	 The big deal is I don\xc2\x92t want naked, greasy strangers in my apartment\nwhen I want to kick back with a puzzle\xc2\x97beer! Cold beer.'
Rachel	 Hey Joey, what \xc2\x91cha doing?'
Joey	 Sweepin\xc2\x92. Why? Turn you on?'
Rachel	 No.'
Joey	 Huh. What if I was sweeping a chimney?'
Rachel	 Joey, did you my face cream?'
Joey	 Where are you going? The vicar won\xc2\x92t be home for hours.'
Rachel	 Joey, (nervously) where did you learn that word?'
Joey	 Where do you think, (pause) Zelda?'
Rachel	 (gasps) You found my book?!'
Joey	 Yeah I did!'
Rachel	 Joey, what-what are you doing going into my bedroom?!'
Joey	 Okay, look I\xc2\x92m sorry, I went in there to take a nap and I know I\nshouldn\xc2\x92t have, but you got porn!'
Rachel	 Hey-hey, y\xc2\x92know what? I don\xc2\x92t care! I\xc2\x92m not ashamed of my\nbook. There\xc2\x92s nothing with a woman enjoying a little\xc2\x85erotica. It\xc2\x92s just a\nhealthy expression of female sexuality, which by the way, you will never understand. (She\ngoes into her room.)'
Joey	 You got porn!'
Ross	 Hello.'
Woman	 Hi, is uh Phoebe here?'
Ross	 Uh no-no, she-she\xc2\x92s out for the night.'
Woman	 Ohh great.'
Ross	 Can I, can I help you with something?'
Woman	 Well, I don\xc2\x92t know. Are you a masseur?'
Ross	 (deadpan) Yes I am.'
Woman	 Great! (Calls down the hall) Dad! (Her old father walks in.) Thank you so\nmuch, I\xc2\x92ll be back to pick him up in an hour. (She walks away.) '
Mrs. Geller	 So Chandler, you\xc2\x92re parents must\xc2\x92ve been thrilled when\nyou told them you were engaged.'
Chandler	 Oh yeah, I should probably call them.'
Mr. Geller	 I remember when we first got engaged.'
Chandler	 Oh, I don\xc2\x92t think I ever heard that story.'
Monica	 Oh dad, really you don\xc2\x92t need to\xc2\x85'
Mr. Geller	 (ignoring her) Well, I\xc2\x92d gotten Judy pregnant. I still\ndon\xc2\x92t know that happened.'
Mrs. Geller	 (incredulous) You don\xc2\x92t know how that happened?! Your dog\nthought my diaphragm was a chew toy!'
Chandler	 What a sweet story.'
Monica	 Well, at least you\xc2\x92re not hearing it for the first time at your\nfifth grade Halloween party.'
Mr. Geller	 What?! They wanted a scary story!'
Monica	 Anyway, we\xc2\x92re really excited about our wedding plans, and well I\nguess pretty soon we\xc2\x92ll be making a big withdrawal from the Monica wedding fund.\n(Chandler and her laugh, but her parents don\xc2\x92t.) What?'
Mrs. Geller	 You tell her Jack, I can\xc2\x92t do it.'
Monica	 What happened? You still have the Monica wedding fund don\xc2\x92t you?'
Mr. Geller	 We have it. Only now, we call it the beach house.'

Monica	 I don\xc2\x92t believe you spent my wedding fund on the beach house!'
Mrs. Geller	 We\xc2\x92re sorry honey, but we just assumed if you got married\nafter you turned 30 you\xc2\x92d pay for it yourself.'
Monica	 You bought the beach house when I was 23!'
Mr. Geller	 Which means you had seven years of beach fun and you can\xc2\x92t put\na price on that sweetie.'
Mrs. Geller	 We really do feel bad about this though.'
Mr. Geller	 We started saving again when you were dating Richard and then that\nwent to hell, so we redid the kitchen.'
Monica	 What about when I started dating Chandler?'
Mrs. Geller	 Well it was Chandler! We didn\xc2\x92t think he\xc2\x92d ever\npropose!'
Chandler	 Clearly I did not start drinking enough at the start of the meal.\n(Starts to make up for lost time and takes a big swig of his drink.)'
Monica	 I can\xc2\x92t believe it! That there is no money for my wedding?!'
Mrs. Geller	 We might still have some money, if your father didn\xc2\x92t\nthink it was a good idea to sell ice over the Internet.'
Mr. Geller	 It seemed like such a simple idea.'
Mrs. Geller	 Stupid Jack, the word is stupid.'
Mr. Geller	 All right, enough! I don\xc2\x92t want to hear about it anymore!\n(Under his breath) Good luck, Chandler. (Chandler takes another drink.)'
Ross	 Okay! Now, I\xc2\x92m going to touch you. (He does so, very gingerly.) Ohh,\nthat\xc2\x92s soft. (He starts poking him and notices his salad spoons and starts to massage\nhim with those.)'
Monica	 I can\xc2\x92t believe this. Do you think that your parents could help pay\nfor it?'
Chandler	 I don\xc2\x92t know, my mother spent most of her money on her fourth\nwedding. She\xc2\x92s saving the rest for her divorce. And any extra cash my father has he\nsaves for his yearly trips to (Pause) Dollywood.'
Rachel	 Well what happened at dinner?'
Monica	 My parents spent the money for our wedding!'
Phoebe	 (gasps) My God! What did you order?!'
Rachel	 Wait, but there\xc2\x92s no money! Well this is terrible! You guys are\ngonna have to get married in like a, rec. center!'
Chandler	 Honey, it\xc2\x92s gonna be okay.'
Monica	 No! No it\xc2\x92s not! It\xc2\x92s not gonna be okay! It sucks! No swing\nband! No lilies!'
Rachel	 No, y\xc2\x92know what? It\xc2\x92s gonna be okay. I mean you don\xc2\x92t\nhave to have this rustic Italian feast. Y\xc2\x92know? And-and you don\xc2\x92t need, you\ndon\xc2\x92t need this custom-made, empire waisted, duchess, satin gown; you can wear off\nthe rack. (She starts to cry, as does Monica.)'
Chandler	 Look, it really is gonna be okay. The important thing is that we love\neach other and that we\xc2\x92re gonna get married.'
Rachel	 Do you even understand what off the rack means?!'
Phoebe	 Look, why don\xc2\x92t you just pay for it yourself?'
Monica	 How? I don\xc2\x92t have any money.'
Chandler	 Well, I have some.'
Monica	 How much?'
Chandler	 Well, close to\xc2\x85 (Notices Rachel leaning in to hear and decides to\nwrite it on a piece of paper and hand it to Monica as Phoebe averts her eyes.) '
Monica	 Whoa!!! Are you kidding me?!'
Rachel	 Well what?! How-how much is it?!'
Monica	 It\xc2\x92s enough for wedding scenario eight.'
Rachel	 Ohh! (Whispers.) Really?!'
Monica	 (To Chandler) How great are you, you little saver?! I mean, the-the\namount you have is exactly the budget of my dream wedding!'
Rachel	 (starting to cry) Ohh, you guys are so made for each other.'
Chandler	 Well, you\xc2\x92re not suggesting that we spend all of the money on the\nwedding?'
Rachel and Monica	 Ah, yeah!'
Chandler	 Well, come on, I\xc2\x92ve been saving this money for six years and I\nkinda had some of it earmarked for the future, not just for a party.'
Phoebe	 (reading the slip of paper) Wow! (In a sultry voice) Hello, Mr.\nChandler.'
Monica	 This is the most special day of our lives.'
Chandler	 No, I realize that honey, but I\xc2\x92m not gonna spend all of the\nmoney on one party.'
Monica	 Honey, umm I-I love you, (laughs) but umm, if you call our wedding a\nparty one more time, you may not get invited. Okay? (Laughs) Listen, we could always\nearn more money, okay? But uh, we\xc2\x92re only gonna get married once.'
Chandler	 Look, I understand, but I have to put my foot down. Okay? The answer\nis no.'
Monica	 You-you\xc2\x92re gonna have to put your foot down?'
Chandler	 Yes, I am!'
Phoebe	 Wow, money and a firm hand. Finally a Chandler I can get on board with.'
Joey	 Hey Rach.'
Rachel	 (quietly) Joey.'
Joey	 Hey Rach, do you smell smoke?'
Rachel	 Uh-huh, I get it, smoke, chimney, chimney sweep, very funny, ha-ha.'
Joey	 No-no-no, I\xc2\x92m serious. You don\xc2\x92t smell it? Something\xc2\x92s on\nfire.'
Rachel	 Well no, I don\xc2\x92t smell anything.'
Joey	 Oh, y\xc2\x92know what? It\xc2\x92s probably just your burnin\xc2\x92 loins.'
Ross	 (sitting down) Hey, what are you guys, what are you guys talking about?'
Rachel	 Nothing!'
Ross	 (takes a drink) Damn, this coffee\xc2\x92s cold! Hey Rach, do you mind if I\nheat this up on your loins? (Joey and he both laugh.)'
Rachel	 Y\xc2\x92know, I can not believe you told him, Joey!'
Ross	 So I guess you bought that book after we broke up huh?'
Rachel	 Uh-huh, yeah I did, because I wore out my first copy when I was with\nyou. (Exits.)'
Ross	 (chases her) Oh yeah, yeah? Well uh, when we were going out, I read tons\nof porno magazines! (Realizes a table of women overheard him.) (To that table.) \xc2\x91Sup?'
Phoebe	 (entering) Ross! How could you do that to an old man?!'
Ross	 (looking at the table) Excuse me ladies. (To Phoebe) I\xc2\x92m sorry?'
Phoebe	 My massage client, Arthur? His daughter called and said that some guy\nthat worked for me gave him a really weird massage this afternoon.'
Ross	 (incredulous) I gave him an extremely professional massage!'
Phoebe	 He said you poked at him with wooden spoons.'
Ross	 Okay, so it wasn\xc2\x92t uh, a traditional massage. But I did give him\naccu-pressure with a pair of chopsticks. And, and I gently exfoliated him with, with a\nmop.'
Phoebe	 Well, he\xc2\x92s never coming back! Okay? You just cost me eight dollars\na week!'
Ross	 Hey, y\xc2\x92know what? This is your fault! You\xc2\x92re the one that\ndidn\xc2\x92t move his-his appointment.'
Phoebe	 Oh, it\xc2\x92s my fault?! You didn\xc2\x92t have to massage him! You\ncould\xc2\x92ve sent him away! You could\xc2\x92ve not rolled Tonka trucks up and down\nhis back!'
Ross	 He said he liked that!! Oh you\xc2\x92re right, you\xc2\x92re right. I\xc2\x92m\nsorry.'
Joey	 Dude, what are you massaging an old man for?'
Ross	 His daughter was hot.'
Joey	 Gotcha.'
Monica	 Hey.'
Chandler	 Hey.'
Monica	 Listen umm, I\xc2\x92ve been thinking, it\xc2\x92s not fair for me to ask\nyou to spend all of your money on our wedding. I mean, you work, you work really hard for\nthat.'
Chandler	 Ehh.'
Monica	 Eh, you work for that.'
Chandler	 Look, I thought about it too, and I\xc2\x92m sorry. I think we should\nspend all of the money on the wedding.'
Monica	 You do?!'
Chandler	 Yeah, I\xc2\x92m putting my foot down. Yeah look, when I proposed I told\nyou that I would do anything to make you happy, and if having the perfect wedding makes\nyou happy then, then that\xc2\x92s what we\xc2\x92re gonna do.'
Monica	 Oh, you\xc2\x92re so sweet. (They hug and kiss.) Oh, but wait, what about\nour, what about the future and stuff?'
Chandler	 Eh, forget about the future and stuff! So we only have two kids,\ny\xc2\x92know? We\xc2\x92ll pick our favorite and that one will get to go to college.'
Monica	 You thought about that?'
Chandler	 Yeah.'
Monica	 How many kids were we gonna have?'
Chandler	 Uh, four, a boy, twin girls and another boy.'
Monica	 What else did you think about?'
Chandler	 Well, stuff like where\xc2\x92d we live, y\xc2\x92know? Like a small place\noutside the city, where our kids could learn to ride their bikes and stuff. Y\xc2\x92know,\nwe could have a cat that had a bell on it\xc2\x92s collar and we could hear it every time it\nran through the little kitty door. Of course, we\xc2\x92d have an apartment over the garage\nwhere Joey could grow old.'
Monica	 (laughs) Y\xc2\x92know what? I-I don\xc2\x92t want a big, fancy wedding.'
Chandler	 Sure you do.'
Monica	 No, I want everything you just said. I want a marriage.'
Chandler	 You sure?'
Monica	 Uh-hmm.'
Chandler	 I love you so much.'
Monica	 I love you. (They kiss.) Hey listen umm, when, when you were\ntalkin\xc2\x92 about our future you said cat, but you meant dog right.'
Chandler	 Oh yeah, totally!'
Monica	 Oh good.'

Joey	 Hello, Zelda.'
Rachel	 Who are you supposed to be?'
Joey	 The vicar!'
Rachel	 Do you even know what a vicar is?'
Joey	 Like a goalie, right?'
Rachel	 (sarcastically) Yeah. Look Joey, it\xc2\x92s enough all right?! You keep\nmaking these stupid jokes and this sleazy innuendoes and it\xc2\x92s\xc2\x97I\xc2\x92m\nnot\xc2\x97it\xc2\x92s just not funny anymore!'
Joey	 All right, I\xc2\x92m sorry. Rach I\xc2\x97Rach I\xc2\x92m sorry. Okay? I\xc2\x92m\nsorry! Maybe I can make up for it by, taking you roughly in the barn. (Giggles.)'
Rachel	 All right! Y\xc2\x92know what? That\xc2\x92s it! You wanna do it?!\nLet\xc2\x92s do it!'
Joey	 Huh?'
Rachel	 (starting to move closer to him) That\xc2\x92s right, I wanna do it with\nyou! I\xc2\x92ve been trying to fight it, but you just said all the right things.'
Joey	 (nervously backing away) I-I-I-I did? (He puts a stool in front of her.)'
Rachel	 (moves the stool out of the way) Yeah! Ohh, I\xc2\x92ve been waitin\xc2\x92\nso long to get on that body!'
Joey	 This body? (He backs into the kitchen.)'
Rachel	 Yeah that\xc2\x92s right! Come on Joey; sex me up!'
Joey	 Hey-hey, you\xc2\x92re startin\xc2\x92 to sound like the butcher\xc2\x92s wife\nthere in-in chapter seven.'
Rachel	 Oh, come on now, don\xc2\x92t keep me waiting. Get those clothes off! But,\nI would keep that helmet on because you\xc2\x92re in for a rough ride! (He backs into\nthe door.)'
Joey	 I don\xc2\x92t want to, I\xc2\x92m scared.'
