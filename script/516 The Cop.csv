Joey	 Hey!'
Chandler	 Hey!'
Monica	 Hey!'
Joey	 What are you guys doing up?'
Chandler	 Oh, we wanted to finish the crossword before we went to bed. Hey, do\nyou know a six-letter word for red?'
Joey	 (thinks) Dark red.'
Chandler	 Yeah, I think that's wrong, but there's a Connect the Dots in here for\nyou later. (To Monica) Hey, how about maroon?"
Monica	 (checks to see if it works) Yes, you are so smart! (Kisses him.)'
Joey	 Aww, you guys are so cute!'
Monica	 I know.'
Joey	 All right, I'll see you in the morning."
Chandler and Monica	 Okay.'
Dream Monica	 Y'know, I love doing crossword puzzles with you honey!"
Dream Joey	 Aww, me too. Now let's finish this and go to bed."
Dream Monica	 Okay! There's only one left, three letter word, not dog\nbut\xc2\x85"
Dream Joey	 Cat.'
Dream Monica	 Yes! You are so smart! (Kisses him.) I love you.'
Dream Joey	 I love you too.'

Rachel	 (looking at the bill) Uhh, we still need a tip.'
Phoebe	 All right. Hold on. (She starts digging in the chair.) I got it. Nickel!\n(Donates it.) How much more do we need?'
Rachel	 A couple of bucks.'
Phoebe	 Okay, dime! (Donates that.) You guys should probably keep talking; this\ncould take a while. (Finds something else.) Oh no, wait! Look it! Whoa! (Looks at it.) Oh\nmy God, this is a police badge!'
Monica	 Wow!'
Chandler	 Oh that's so cool! Why would a cop come in here though? They don't\nserve donuts. (No one laughs.) Y'know what actually, could you discover the badge again? I\nthink I can come up with something better than that."
Rachel	 Phoebe, I bet somebody's missing that badge."
Phoebe	 Yeah, I should probably take it back. Ooh, but you know what? While I'm\nat the police station, I could check their Ten Most Wanted lists because my friend Fritzy\nhas been like number 11 forever, so this could be her year! (She crosses her fingers in\nhope.)"
Joey	 (entering) Hey, you guys!'
Chandler	 Hey!'
Rachel	 Hey Joey!'
Monica	 Hey.'
Joey	 (To Monica) Hey. That uh, that my sweatshirt?'
Monica	 Oh yes, it is. I'm sorry I borrowed it, I was cold. I hope its okay?"
Joey	 Well uh, it's just that uh, y'know if-if you're gonna be wearing someone's\nsweatshirt shouldn't it be your boyfriends--and I\xc2\x92m not him."
Monica	 I'm sorry, I'll give it back to you."
Joey	 No-no! No! I mean it's gonna be all smelling like Monica!"
Monica	 Are you saying I smell bad?'
Joey	 No! No, you smell like a meadow. (Pause.) I'm sorry. (Runs to the\nbathroom.)"
Monica	 What's with him?"
Chandler	 Oh, y'know what? The last time Joey went to a meadow, his mother was\nshot by a hunter."
Rachel	 (disgusted at Ross's antics) Ugh!"
Ross	 (To Rachel) Yeah, I still don\'t know. (To the salesman who is hovering\nnearby) I\'m sorry I just wanna make sure that I bought the right couch. I need a couch\nthat says, "Kids welcome here." But that also says, (In a sexy voice) "Come\nhere to me!"'
Rachel	 What?! You say that to kids?!!'
Ross	 No! No! No! The "Come here to me" is y\'know for the ladies.'
Rachel	 Ross, honey, it's a nice couch. It's not a magic couch."
The Salesman	 You picked a great couch.'
Ross	 Yeah?'
The Salesman	 Yeah. Could you just sign right here please? (Hands him a\nclipboard.)'
Ross	 Oh, sure. Whoa-whoa, what's this? The delivery charge is almost as much as\nthe couch!"
Rachel	 Wait! No, that's ridiculous. Come on, he lives three blocks away!"
Ross	 Yeah, y'know what? I'll take it myself, thank you! (He signs the form and\nhands it back to the salesman.) All right Rach, let's go! (He picks up one end of the\ncouch.)"
Rachel	 Yeah! (She puts on her coat and turns around and sees Ross is expecting\nher to help.) (Laughing.) Are you kiddin'?"
Ross	 Oh, come on it's only three blocks! And-and, it's not very heavy, try it!\nCome on! Come on!"
Rachel	 (Disgustedly she goes and tries to pick up the couch. Much to her\namazement, she is successful.) Oh. Oh! I can do it!'
Ross	 Yeah!'
The Salesman	 You two are really gonna enjoy that couch.'
Ross	 Oh yeah, we're uh, yeah we're not together. (He starts backing out of the\nstore.)"
The Salesman	 Ohh, okay. (Laughs.) Something didn't quite add up there. (Ross\nstops, walks back to talk to the salesman, and in the process pushes Rachel up against a\nwall.)"
Rachel	 Ross!'
Ross	 What's that supposed to mean?"
Rachel	 Ross!'
The Salesman	 Well you, her, I mean, she's very\xc2\x85y'know. And you're\nlike\xc2\x85y'know."
Ross	 Not that it's any of your business, but we did go out."
The Salesman	 Really? You two?'
Ross	 Yeah! Rach?'
Rachel	 Come on, I don't really want to be doing this right now. I am carrying a\nvery heavy couch."
Ross	 Then tell him quickly.'
Rachel	 (To Ross) Fine! (To the salesman) We went out.'
Ross	 Not only did we go out, we did it 298 times!'
Rachel	 Ross!! Oh my--ugh!! You kept count?! You are such a loser!'
Ross	 A loser you did it with (To the salesman) 298 times!'
Phoebe	 Oh. Oh! Ma'am? Excuse me, ma'am? "
The Smoking Woman	 Yes?'
Phoebe	 You can't put your cigarette out on a tree!"
The Smoking Woman	 Yeah I can, it worked real well.'
Phoebe	 No but you shouldn't! Don't ever do that again."
The Smoking Woman	 I won't! (Turns away) Until I have my next cigarette."
Phoebe	 Hold it! (Grabs the badge) N.Y.P.D! Freeze punk!'
The Smoking Woman	 What?!'
Phoebe	 Yeah that's right you are so busted. (To no one in particular.) Book\n'em."
The Smoking Woman	 Who are you talking too?'
Phoebe	 Save it Red! Unless you wanna spend the night in the slammer, you\napologize to the tree.'
The Smoking Woman	 I am not going to apologize to a tree!'
Phoebe	 You apologize to the tree right now or I am calling for backup. (The\nwoman calls her bluff.) (Screaming at no one in particular) Backup! Backup!!'
The Smoking Woman	 I-I'm sorry! Sorry."
Phoebe	 Okay, cancel backup! Cancel backup!'
Ross	 Okay. (Throws off the last cushion.)'
Rachel	 Ross, didn't you say that there was an elevator in here?"
Ross	 Uhh, yes I did but there isn't. Okay, here we go."
Ross	 Okay, go left. Left! Left! (The bottom of the couch is hitting the\nrailing.)'
Rachel	 Okay, y'know what? There is no more left, left!"
Ross	 Oh okay, lift it straight up over your head! Straight up over your head!\nYou can do it! You can do it! (She gets it lifted up and they make the first turn.) Okay.\nYou got it?'
Rachel	 Yeah.'
Ross	 Good-good-good. '
Rachel	 Oh-oh! '
Ross	 Yeah, you got it right? You got it right? You got it? '
Rachel	 Any chance you think the couch looks good there?'
Phoebe	 \xc2\x85so this guy was all (Mumbles.) And I'm all, Buffay, Homicide.\n(Flashes the badge.) It was just so cool!"
Monica	 (cooking something) Phoebe, you were supposed to take that back!'
Phoebe	 I know but I'm having so much fun doing good deeds."
Chandler	 Okay, but impersonating a police officer is a serious thing. You could\nget arrested.'
Phoebe	 You could get arrested, right now! (Flashes the badge and they glare at\nher.) All right, yeah, I gotta take it back. I'm totally drunk with power. (She heads for\nthe door just as Joey enters.)"
Phoebe	 (To Joey) Hey.'
Joey	 (To Phoebe) Hey! (Sees that Monica's there.) Oh."
Chandler	 Hi, Joe.'
Joey	 Yeah, I didn\xc2\x92t know you guys were going to be here.'
Monica	 Hey Joey, sweetie, taste this. (Holds out a spoon for him.)'
Joey	 (backing away) What?! Why?!'
Monica	 What is going on with you?'
Joey	 Nothing!'
Chandler	 Oh, come on! You've been acting strange all day!"
Joey	 All right! There is something. I kinda had a dream, (pause) but I don't\nwant to talk about it. (Starts for his room.)"
Chandler	 Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-what-what if Martin Luther King had said\nthat? (Imitating what his famous speech would sound like.) I kinda have a dream! I\ndon\xc2\x92t want to talk about it.'
Joey	 Well, it involved Monica.'
Chandler	 You had a dream about a girl that I am seeing?! Oh, that is so cool!\n(To Monica) I can't tell you how many times I've dreamt about a girl that he was seeing.\n(Seeing Monica's stare.) (To Joey) Anyway we're talking about your dream. (To Monica) I\nlove you. (To Joey) Your dream? (Leans in to listen closely.)"
Joey	 Don't worry, there wasn't any sex in it or anything. I haven't dreamt\nabout her like that since I found out about you two--ish. "
Monica	 What was the dream about?'
Joey	 Well, okay. You were my girlfriend and we were doing the crossword\npuzzle. Y'know like you guys were doing last night. So, that's it. I'm in love with Monica\nand I'll be moving out."
Monica	 Wait, Joey! Joey! That doesn\xc2\x92t mean that-that you're in love with\nme!"
Joey	 It-it doesn\xc2\x92t?'
Monica	 No!'
Chandler	 No, it can mean anything. Like uh, all of the sudden you're jealous\nbecause I've become the apartment stud."
Joey	 That kinda sounds like your dream dude.'
Monica	 Or, it could mean that-that you saw Chandler and me together and we\ny'know were being close and stuff and then you just want to have that with someone too."
Joey	 In the dream I did enjoy the closeness.'
Monica	 Um-hmm.'
Chandler	 Joey, look, are you attracted to Monica? Right here, right now, are\nyou attracted to her?'
Joey	 (looks at her) Not really.'
Chandler	 Well there you have it!'
Monica	 Well sure! I'm just wearing sweats! (Looking at Chandler and slowly\nrealizing what his point is.) But that's good that you're not in love with me, because you\njust want a girlfriend!"
Joey	 No, I don't think it's just about just getting a girlfriend. Y'know? I\nmean, yeah, I can get a girlfriend! Yeah, we could sit in the chair and do crosswords, but\ny'know are we ever going to have y'know the closeness like-like you guys have?"
Chandler	 Well y'know, Monica and I were friends before we started\ndating. So maybe-maybe that's it?"
Joey	 Friends first? That's interesting."
Monica	 You become friends after?'
Joey	 No, never done that either.'
Rachel	 (entering) Hey, umm, do you guys have that tape measure?'
Chandler	 Oh yeah, it's actually in my bedroom."
Monica	 (laughing) That's right."
Rachel	 (noticing him) What's up Joey?"
Joey	 (in a sexy voice) How you doin'?"

Phoebe	 Excuse me, is this your car?'
Guy	 Yeah.'
Phoebe	 Well I don't think it's very nice of you to park here, y'know you're\nblocking the entrance. "
Guy	 Don't worry about it. It's not a problem."
Phoebe	 Well, it's a problem for me, which means it's a problem for you 'cause\nI'm a cop. (Shows the badge.)"
Guy	 (he reaches into the car and slams his siren on the roof.) So am I!'
Phoebe	 Ohh, no. (Pause) Oh okay, so you're a cop which means you can park\nanywhere, 'cause I know that 'cause I'm a cop too. So, all right, keep up the good work.\n10-4. (Tries to leave.)"
Cop	 (stopping her) Hey, wait a second! So wait, what precinct are you with?'
Phoebe	 I-I'm with the umm, the 57th."
Cop	 Oh, I know a guy in homicide up there.'
Phoebe	 I'm in vice. Yeah, in fact I'm undercover right now. I'm a whore."
Cop	 Who-who else is in vice up there?'
Phoebe	 Umm, do you know, umm Sipowicz?'
Cop	 Sipowicz? No, I don't think so."
Phoebe	 Yeah, big guy, kinda bald.'
Cop	 No, I don't know him."
Phoebe	 (starts to walk away, but stops) Don\xc2\x92t try to call him or anything,\n'cause he's not there, he's out. His umm, his partner just died."
Cop	 Wow umm, tell Sipowicz I'm real sorry for his loss."
Phoebe	 I-I sure will, take care. (Starts walking off.)'
Cop	 (following her) Hey by the way, I'm sure Sipowicz is gonna be all right. I\nheard that kid from Silver Spoons is really good. (Phoebe's stunned) And where did\nyou find my badge?"
Phoebe	 Oh. (She starts laughing. Then she throws the badge at him and runs\naway.)'
Rachel	 Hey! Joey, would you mind giving me and Ross a hand moving his couch?'
Joey	 Oh, I'd love too, but I got acting class. But y'know what? I guess I can\nblow that off, (In a sexy voice) for you."
Rachel	 Thanks!'
Joey	 Uh, hey, Rach let me ask you something. Uh, I was just over there talking\nto Monica and Chandler, boy they are really tight.'
Rachel	 I know.'
Joey	 Yeah that's not such a bad situation they got going over there. I'm\nthinking of getting me one of those."
Rachel	 What's up Joe?"
Joey	 Well, the reason I think Monica and Chandler are so great\xc2\x85'
Rachel	 Yeah?'
Joey	 \xc2\x85is because they were friends first. Y\'know? So I asked myself,\n"Who are my friends?" You and Phoebe, and I saw you first. So\xc2\x85'
Rachel	 (laughing) What are you saying?'
Joey	 I'm saying maybe you and I crank it up a notch."
Rachel	 Y'know honey, umm, as uh, as flattered as I am that uh, you saw me\nfirst, uhh, I just, I-I don't think we should be cranking anything up."
Joey	 I'll treat you real nice. (Pulls out a chair for her.)"
Rachel	 (laughs and pushes the chair back in) Yeah, well, y'know umm\xc2\x85 No\nhoney, listen I think it's a great idea to become friends with someone before you\ndate them, but I think the way you do it is y'know you meet someone, become their friend,\nbuild a foundation, then you ask them out on a date. Don't hit on your existing friends!"
Joey	 Won't-won't that take longer?"
Rachel	 Yeah. Yeah. Oh, but once you find it, ohh it's so worth the wait."
Joey	 Yeah. I understand. I understand. (Pause) Man, I wish I saw Phoebe\nfirst!'
Ross	 Come here to me. No-no, you come here to me.'
Rachel	 (entering) Hey Ross! I brought reinforcements.'
Ross	 Oh great! What, you brought Joey?'
Rachel	 Well, I brought the next best thing.'
Chandler	 (entering) Hey!'
Ross	 Chandler?! You brought Chandler?! The next best thing would be Monica!'
Chandler	 Y'know, I would be offended, but Monica is freakishly strong, so\xc2\x85"
Ross	 Look, I-I drew a sketch about how we're gonna do it. (Showing them) Okay\nRach, (points to the sketch) that's you. That's the couch. (Points again.) "
Rachel	 Whoa-oh, what's-what's that? (Points.)"
Ross	 Oh, that's me."
Rachel	 Wow! You certainly think a lot of yourself.'
Ross	 No! That's-that's my arm!"
Chandler	 (looking at the sketch) Oh, I see. I thought you just really, really\nliked your new couch.'
Ross	 Y'know what? Just-just follow my lead. "
Rachel	 Okay!'
Chandler	 Okay.'
Ross	 Come on, Chandler. '
Ross	 All right. (They start up the stairs. Ross is first.) Okay, here we go!'
Ross	 All right, ready?'
Chandler	 Yeah.'
Ross	 Turn.'
Chandler	 (straining) Okay.'
Ross	 Turn! Turn!'
Chandler	 Okay, I don't think we can turn anymore!"
Rachel	 Ross, I don't, I just don't think it's going to fit."
Ross	 Oh yeah it will! Come on, up! Up-up-up! Up! Yes! Here we go! Pivot! (They\nstart up the stairs again. Chandler is between the couch and the wall now.) Pivot! Piv-ot!\nPiv-et!! Piv-ett!!! Piv-et!'
Chandler	 Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!!'
Ross	 Okay, I don't think it's going to pivot anymore."
Chandler and Rachel	 You think?!'
Ross	 All right, let's uh, let's bring it back down and-and try again."
Chandler	 Okay, yeah, I think it's really stuck now."
Ross	 I can't believe that didn't work!"
Rachel	 I know, me neither! I mean, you had a sketch!'
Chandler	 Oh, y'know, what did you mean when you said pivot?"
Joey	 (entering) Hey!'
Rachel	 Hey! How's it going? Did you make any new friends?"
Joey	 Yeah, yeah, I met this woman. (Starts for his room.)'
Chandler	 (stopping him) Hey, whoa-whoa! What's she like?"
Joey	 Uhh, well, she's\xc2\x85really good in bed."
Monica	 Joey, I thought you were gonna try to be friends first!'
Joey	 (To Rachel) Well look, hey, it's all your fault!"
Rachel	 What?! Why?!'
Joey	 Well because you didn't give me advice! No! You gave me a pickup line! As\nsoon as I told her I wanted to y'know, build a foundation and be friends first. I\nsuddenly, through no fault of my own, became irresistible to her! (Pause) And her\nroommate!"
Monica	 What about the closeness?'
Joey	 Closeness-shmoshness! There was three of us for crying out loud!'
Joey	 (entering) All right! Hey, who wants pizza?!'
Chandler	 Ooh, I do! I do! I do!'
Joey	 (taking a bite) Oh, great! Can you believe I found it on the second floor?\n'
Monica	 Who is it?'
Phoebe and Joey	 Oh my God!'
Joey	 Uhh, just a minute officer!! '
Cop	 I'm looking for Phoebe Buffay!"
Phoebe	 Ooh, God, it's him! It's that cop! God, I can't believe it! He found me!"
Rachel	 Oh my God, Phoebe, are you gonna go to jail?!'
Phoebe	 Well, if I'm going down, I'm taking you (Points at all of them) with me.\n(They all look at her.) Harboring a fugitive? That's one to three years minimum. Good luck\nChandler. (She opens the door to the cop from before.) Okay, you can arrest me. Fine. But\nyou'll never make it stick and you know it!"
Cop	 Yeah, but I kinda don't have a choice, it's my job. I mean, you understand\nright?"
Phoebe	 Yep! As long as you understand that I'm going to call my lawyer and once\nhe puts you on the stand he'll make you look like a fool. A fool!"
Cop	 I don't like looking foolish. Y'know what? Maybe uh, I don't arrest you\ntoday. Maybe I came by and you weren't here."
Phoebe	 I would love it if I weren't here!"
Cop	 Okay, so since umm, you're not going to jail tonight I was wondering if you\nwould like to go to dinner with me?"
Phoebe	 Me?!'
Cop	 Yeah. Ever since you flashed my badge at me, I kinda can't stop thinking\nabout you. You're the prettiest, fake undercover whore I've ever seen."
Chandler and Joey	 Nice!'
Phoebe	 Wow! I didn't see that coming! You're-you're asking me out!"
Cop	 Yeah. I mean, I coulda done it better, but these people keep staring at me.'
Phoebe	 Umm, yeah, I'd like to go out with you officer\xc2\x85"
Cop	 Gary.'
Phoebe	 Gary.'
Gary	 Okay, so it's a date."
Phoebe	 Yeah! So--ooh, I gotta ask you though. How did you know where to find\nme?'
Gary	 Well you're fingerprints were all over my badge so I just ran it through\nthe computer and this was listed as your last known address so I just checked it out."
Phoebe	 Ohh, impressive.'
Gary	 Not as impressive as you. I gotta tell you, I looked at your record and\nyou've done some pretty weird stuff."
Phoebe	 Yeah, we'll talk at dinner."
Gary	 Okay. (He starts to leave.) So I'll come by in a couple hours and pick you\nup?"
Phoebe	 All right, I can't wait!"
Gary	 Okay. And don't worry, I'm not just gonna take you out for donuts."
Chandler	 (To Rachel) He has a gun!'

Ross	 I'd like to return this couch. I'm not satisfied with it."
The Saleswoman	 You wanna return this couch? (Ross nods yes.) It's cut in half!"
Ross	 That's what I'm telling you."
The Saleswoman	 Did you cut this couch in half?'
Ross	 This couch, is cut in half! I would like to exchange it for one\nthat is not cut in half!'
The Saleswoman	 You're telling me this couch was delivered to you like this?!"
Ross	 Look, I am a reasonable man. I will accept store credit.'
The Saleswoman	 I'll give you store credit in the amount of four dollars."
Ross	 (thinks) I take it.'
