Chandler	 Hey, you guys!'
Ross and Rachel	 Hey!'
Chandler	 So, what do you think?'
Ross	 About what?'
Rachel	 Yeah, what?'
Joey	 What?'
Chandler	 Are you kidding? Okay, I\xc2\x92ll give you a hint; I\xc2\x92ll give you a\nhint. (Points to his glasses.)'
Joey	 Eyes! No, no. Your eyes! No. Chandler\xc2\x92s eyes!'
Chandler	 I got glasses!'
Ross	 Well, you-you\xc2\x92ve always had glasses.'
Chandler	 No I didn\xc2\x92t!'
Ross	 Are you sure?'
Rachel	 Yeah-yeah, did-didn\xc2\x92t you use to have a pair? They were really\nround, burgundy, and they made you look kind of umm\xc2\x85'
Joey	 Feminine.'
Rachel	 Yes!'
Chandler	 No!'
Monica	 Sweetie, I think the glasses look great. They make you look really sexy.'
Chandler	 Really?'
Monica	 Yeah!'
Chandler	 (sitting down on the arm of her chair) You didn\xc2\x92t think I used to\nwear glasses, right?'
Monica	 Of course! (She mouths, "I have no idea," to the rest of the\ngang.)'

Phoebe	 So what do you guys want for an engagement present?'
Chandler	 That\xc2\x92s okay Pheebs, we\xc2\x92re not having a party or anything, so\nyou don\xc2\x92t have to get us\xc2\x85'
Monica	 (interrupts him) If someone wants to give us a present, we don\xc2\x92t\nwant to deprive them of that joy.'
Rachel	 Oh, y\xc2\x92know what you should get \xc2\x91em? One of those little uh,\nportable CD players.'
Monica	 Oh, I already have one. '
Phoebe	 Not unless someone borrowed it and left it at the gynecologist.'
Rachel	 Yeah, and-and-and by someone, she means Joey.'
Monica	 Hey, I know I what I want!'
Chandler	 What we want honey.'
Monica	 No, you don\xc2\x92t want this. I want to have your grandmother\xc2\x92s\ncookie recipe.'
Phoebe	 You mean the chocolate chip cookie recipe?'
Monica	 Uh-huh, yeah.'
Phoebe	 You mean the one that my grandmother made me swear on her deathbed that\nI would never let out of our family?'
Chandler	 Dying people say the craziest things.'
Monica	 I wanted it for years! I was gonna make cookies for my children.'
Phoebe	 Break my heart\xc2\x97Oh, all right.'
Monica	 Okay. I\xc2\x92m gonna be the mom that makes the world\xc2\x92s best\nchocolate chip cookies.'
Chandler	 Our kids are gonna be fat aren\xc2\x92t they.'
Joey	 (entering) Ahoy!'
Chandler	 Hey! How\xc2\x92s the boat?!'
Joey	 Great! I\xc2\x92m finally getting into this sailing stuff.'
Monica	 Oh, so you finally took it out of the marina huh?'
Joey	 Why would I do that? It took three guys to get the thing in there!'
Phoebe	 If you don\xc2\x92t sail your boat, what do you do on it?'
Joey	 Oh, it\xc2\x92s great! It\xc2\x92s a great place to just kinda, sit, hang\naround, drink a few beers, eat some chips. (He says that as he sits, hangs around, drinks\na beer, and eats a chip.)'
Chandler	 Well, it\xc2\x92s good that you finally have a place to do that.'
Rachel	 Y\xc2\x92know Joey, I could teach you to sail if you want.'
Joey	 You could?'
Rachel	 Yeah! I\xc2\x92ve been sailing my whole life. When I was fifteen my dad\nbought me my own boat.'
Phoebe	 Your own boat?'
Rachel	 What?! What?! He was trying to cheer me up! My pony was sick.'
Chandler	 Do you know what I was thinkin\xc2\x92?'
Monica	 What?'
Chandler	 Nothing, I just like to go like this. (Does it again.)'
Ross	 (entering from the bathrooms) Hey Chandler, what are you doing tonight?'
Chandler	 Uh why, do you have a lecture?'
Ross	 No, why?'
Chandler	 Then free as a bird. What\xc2\x92s up?'
Ross	 My dad wanted to know if you wanted to play racquetball with us.'
Monica	 Wow! That\xc2\x92s great! Dad must really like you, he doesn\xc2\x92t ask\njust anyone to play.'
Ross	 Yeah and he didn\xc2\x92t really ask for you, he asked for Chancy, I assumed\nhe meant you.'
Chandler	 Well, did-did you correct him?'
Ross	 No, I-I thought it would be more fun this way.'
Monica	 This is so cool, maybe this is something you can do every week.'
Ross	 Or you can sit with him on the front porch and make sure no one steals the\ntrash cans. He does that every week too.'
Monica	 Oh, just so you know, you-you have to let him win.'
Ross	 Yeah.'
Monica	 He hates to lose.'
Chandler	 Oh no problem, maybe I\xc2\x92ll play with my left hand.'
Ross	 You\xc2\x92re not a lefty? '
Chandler	 Does anybody know me?!'
Monica	 What\xc2\x92s wrong Phoebe?'
Phoebe	 I just went to my old apartment to get you the-the cookie recipe and the\nstupid fire burned it up!'
Monica	 No!! Why didn\xc2\x92t you make a copy and-and keep it in a fireproof box\nand keep it at least a hundred yards from the original?!!'
Phoebe	 (pauses as he figures out how to answer that) Because I\xc2\x92m normal!\nThat was the one legacy my grandmother left me, and I know you wanted it as an\nengagement present.'
Ross	 Oh, we have to get you an engagement present?'
Chandler	 Don\xc2\x92t worry about it Pheebs.'
Ross	 No one got me an engagement present.'
Phoebe	 Okay, here I wish you health and happiness. (She hands Monica a cookie\nin a plastic baggie.) '
Chandler	 An old cookie?'
Monica	 (To Chandler) This is what happens when you don\xc2\x92t register for\ngifts!'
Phoebe	 See no-no, I made a batch and I froze it, and this is the only one left.'
Chandler	 We can\xc2\x92t accept this.'
Phoebe	 Why not?'
Chandler	 \xc2\x91Cause it\xc2\x92s gross.'
Monica	 No! Wait! I think I can figure out the recipe from this cookie! I do\nstuff like this at work all the time.'
Phoebe	 Really?!'
Monica	 Yeah! I bet I can do it.'
Chandler	 Okay, we owe you a present.'
Ross	 Two! I\xc2\x92ve been engaged twice!'
Joey	 (drinking a beer) Look at this clown! Just because he\xc2\x92s got a bigger\nboat he thinks he can take up the whole river. (Yelling) Get out of the way jackass! (To\nRachel) Who names his boat Coast Guard anyway?'
Rachel	 That is the Coast Guard. '
Joey	 What are they doing out here? The coast\xc2\x92s all the way over there.\n(Points to the coast, meanwhile there is coast behind him.)'
Rachel	 Joey, just ignore the boats all right? We\xc2\x92re not finished with the\nlesson yet.'
Joey	 All right.'
Rachel	 Okay, I\xc2\x92m just gonna go over the basic points just one more time,\nare you ready?'
Joey	 Come on Rach, not again. I got it! Okay? Let\xc2\x92s start sailing, and I\nwant to go over there (Points) where that boatload of girls is! (Yelling to them)\nYo-ho-ho!'
Rachel	 Oh, okay. Is that what you want to do? You wanna go over and give a\nlittle shout out to the old, hot chickas? Okay, let\xc2\x92s do that Sailor Joe. Quick\nquestion though, (grabs some of the rigging) what\xc2\x92s this called?'
Joey	 Uh, boat rope.'
Rachel	 Wrong! How do you get the mainsail up?'
Joey	 Uhh, rub it?'
Rachel	 No. What do you do if I say we are coming about?'
Joey	 I\xc2\x92d say, come again. No-no, wait I-I-I know this one, I know this\none, uh\xc2\x85'
Rachel	 Time\xc2\x92s up, now your dead.'
Joey	 And deaf!'
Rachel	 Okay, you just go on and make your little jokey-jokes, but if you do not\nknow what you are doing out at sea you will die at sea. Am I getting through to you\nsailor?! (She punctuates each word by slapping him on the forehead.)'
Joey	 Yes.'
Rachel	 Don\xc2\x92t just say yes! This isn\xc2\x92t a game, Joey you can really get\nhurt out here. Okay, so do you want to pay attention or do you want to die?!'
Joey	 I want to make a ship to shore call to Chandler.'
Monica	 All right, I definitely taste nutmeg.'
Phoebe	 You do?'
Monica	 You don\xc2\x92t? (Laughs) Well, that\xc2\x92s the difference between a\nprofessional and a layman.'
Phoebe	 That and arrogance.'
Joey	 (entering) Hey.'
Monica	 Hey! How was sailing?'
Joey	 I don\xc2\x92t want to talk about it. Y\xc2\x92know, you could\xc2\x92ve at\nleast saved me a whole cookie. (He grabs what\xc2\x92s left of the cookie and pops in his\nmouth.)'
Monica and Phoebe	 No-wait-no-no!!!!!!!'
Joey	 (recoils in horror) Women are mean!!! (Storms out.)'
Phoebe	 I can\xc2\x92t believe that! Now the only thing left of my\ngrandmother\xc2\x92s legacy is this crumb. (She picks it up with her finger and holds it out\nto Monica.) I wish you a long and happy marriage.'
Ross	 (entering with Chandler) Hey.'
Monica	 Hey! How was it?'
Ross	 Well I had a great time! Umm, Chancy on the other hand\xc2\x85'
Chandler	 I will tell the story! It was going great. I let him win. We\nwere bonding. He even said I could call him dad.'
Ross	 And what did he ask you not to call him?'
Chandler	 Daddy. All right look, here\xc2\x92s the story. (Flashback to Chandler\nabout to enter the steam room as he does the voice-over.) Well, we had just finished\nplaying racquetball and we were gonna take a steam. I walk into the steam room and it was\nreally steamy. (The flashback shows his glasses fog up and him trying to find his way\naround the steam filled room. He takes off his glasses.) So I take off my glasses and\nthat\xc2\x92s when in happened.'
Chandler	 Guys?'
Ross	 Over here. (You can see Ross sitting at the far wall.)'
Mr. Geller	 Have a seat son. (You can see Mr. Geller sitting closer to the door\nas Chandler walks over and sits in his lap.) Hey!! (Chandler quickly jumps off and sits\nnext to him with a shocked expression on his face.)'

Monica	 Oh my God Chandler! I can\xc2\x92t believe it!'
Chandler	 I know.'
Monica	 You gave my father a lap dance!'
Chandler	 Why do they put so much steam in there?!'
Ross	 \xc2\x91Cause otherwise they\xc2\x92d have to call it the room room.'
Chandler	 Why? Okay? Why? Wh-wh-why did that have to happen?'
Phoebe	 Come on, it\xc2\x92s not that big a deal!'
Chandler	 Not that big a deal? There\xc2\x85there was touching of things.'
Ross	 Now, I know you wanted to bond with my dad, but did you really have to\nbond to that part?'
Monica	 Listen, I\xc2\x92m sure that dad doesn\xc2\x92t care. He probably thought\nthis was funny; he\xc2\x92ll be telling this story for years!'
Chandler	 I don\xc2\x92t want him to tell this story for years.'
Ross	 Oh, but he will. He still tells the story how Monica tried to escape from\nfat camp.'
Monica	 I wasn\xc2\x92t escaping.'
Ross	 Then how did you get caught in the barbed wire?'
Monica	 I was trying to help out a squirrel.'
Ross	 You were trying to eat it!'
Chandler	 If that is your father calling to tell this story then the\nmarriage is off!'
Monica	 (takes the phone from Ross) Come on. (Answering phone) Hello? (Listens)\nI\xc2\x92m sorry you have the wrong number. (Listens) (Whispering) Okay, I\xc2\x92ll call you\nlater dad. I love you. (Hangs up.)'
Chandler	 (getting up) All right, I\xc2\x92m off to see your dad.'
Ross	 Whoa-whoa, aren\xc2\x92t you a little over dressed?'
Rachel	 (laughing) Yeah, and-and you better make sure he tips you this time.'
Chandler	 Look, I figured I would try to convince him not to tell the story\nanymore, and I figure the best way to do that is face to face\xc2\x97And by face I\ndon\xc2\x92t mean his lap. And by face, I don\xc2\x92t mean my ass. (Exits.)'
Ross	 (To Rachel) Hey are you getting Monica and Chandler an engagement present?'
Rachel	 I don\xc2\x92t know. Y\xc2\x92know, they didn\xc2\x92t get us anything.'
Ross	 Thank you!'
Joey	 (entering) Hey.'
Ross	 Hey.'
Rachel	 Well hello! So, when are we gettin\xc2\x92 back out on the water matey? '
Joey	 Oh uh, I don\xc2\x92t know the boat way to say this, but uh never!'
Rachel	 Why not?'
Joey	 Because! You\xc2\x92re mean on the boat!'
Rachel	 What? I was just trying to teach you.'
Joey	 Well, lesson learned! Rachel is mean!'
Ross	 Yeeeeeep\xc2\x85 Yep-yep-yep-yep-yep. I remember when she took out on her\ndad\xc2\x92s boat she wouldn\xc2\x92t let me help at all.'
Rachel	 Excuse me, I wanted you to help, but you couldn\xc2\x92t move your arms\nbecause you were wearing three life jackets.'
Ross	 You have to respect the sea! (Storms off.)'
Rachel	 Look Joey, I\xc2\x92m sorry if-if you thought that was mean, but I gotta\ntell ya something. That was not mean. Okay, my father is mean. He used to yell at me all\nthe time on the boat, I mean it was horrible. I was just being a good teacher.'
Joey	 Does a good teacher say, "Put down the beer pinhead!?"'
Rachel	 Well, does a good student drink seven beers during his first lesson?'
Joey	 Six and a half! You knocked that last one out of my hand! Remember?'
Rachel	 Yeah, I didn\xc2\x92t want you to get hit by the boom!'
Joey	 Well it hit me anyway! And it would\xc2\x92ve hurt a lot less if I had\nfinished that last beer.'
Rachel	 All right, y\xc2\x92know what? I-I\xc2\x92m sorry. I will try to tone it\ndown and uh stop yelling.'
Joey	 You won\xc2\x92t boss me around anymore?'
Rachel	 I won\xc2\x92t boss you around.'
Joey	 And you\xc2\x92ll be nice?'
Rachel	 And, I\xc2\x92ll be nice.'
Joey	 And you\xc2\x92ll be topless?'
Rachel	 And\xc2\x97Joey!'
Joey	 Do you want me to learn?!'
Monica	 Okay, here\xc2\x92s batch 22. Ohh, maybe these\xc2\x92ll taste a little like\nyour grandmother\xc2\x92s. This has a little bit of orange peel, but no nutmeg.'
Ross	 Let\xc2\x92s give it a shot.'
Monica	 Okay. Man, I have not made this many cookies since I was in the\nninth grade.'
Phoebe	 Oh, what was that for? Like a bake sale?'
Monica	 No, just a Friday night.'
Ross	 Ohh, these are pretty good.'
Phoebe	 Yeah, but not as good as batch 17.'
Ross	 Which one was that?'
Monica	 The ones we had right after you almost threw up.'
Ross	 Oh yeah! Batch 17 was good. I did not like batch 16. (Burps a\nlittle bit.) I\xc2\x92m okay.'
Phoebe	 Are there anymore from the good batch? \xc2\x91Cause we could just work\noff of those.'
Ross	 Yeah, ooh yeah, I think there is one from batch 17 left, uh\xc2\x85 (Grabs a\ncookie and takes a big bite out of it and doesn\xc2\x92t like it.) It\xc2\x92s batch 16! 16\npeople! Get out of the way! (Gets up and runs for the bathroom.)'
Rachel	 Okay Joey honey, you\xc2\x92re doing really good! All right, now I\xc2\x92m\njust gonna need you to step to the port side. (Joey pauses as he tries to remember which\nside is the port side.) Remember? Remember how we talked about the port side?'
Joey	 Ohh yeah.'
Rachel	 Right?'
Joey	 Nope.'
Rachel	 It\xc2\x92s left sweetie, but that\xc2\x92s okay sweetie, that\xc2\x92s a\ntough one.'
Joey	 I don\xc2\x92t know why you just don\xc2\x92t say left.'
Rachel	 Okay, go to the left. (Joey goes starboard or sits on the right side of\nthe boat.) The left!'
Joey	 Huh?'
Rachel	 (yelling) Just sit over there!! (Points to the port side.)'
Joey	 (hurrying over) Okay! Okay, you\xc2\x92re yelling again! See that?'
Rachel	 No! No-no, no-no-no, very quiet, said with love, no yelling.'
Joey	 Oh, y\xc2\x92know what? Since I\xc2\x92m here, I think I\xc2\x92m gonna have me\na little beer on the port side. (Grabs and opens one.)'
Rachel	 Okay Joey, we\xc2\x92re luffing a little bit, so could you tighten up the\ncunningham? (The mainsail has started to flap in the wind and has stopped working\nefficiently; she wants him to tighten it so that it starts working again.)'
Joey	 Uh, wow, you just said a bunch of stuff I didn\xc2\x92t know there.'
Rachel	 Joey, come on! We just went over this! (She does it instead.)'
Joey	 Oh, y\xc2\x92know, when we did that was when that bird was flying overhead\nwith the fish in his mouth. Did you see it? It was gross!'
Rachel	 (angrily) No! All right?! I did not see the bird! I did not\nsee the fish! I did not see the piece of Styrofoam that was shaped like Mike Tyson!\nI did not, because I was trying to teach you how to sail a boat! Which\nobviously is an impossible thing to do!'
Joey	 All right that\xc2\x92s it! You\xc2\x92re yelling and I don\xc2\x92t see you\ntaking your top off! I quit!'
Rachel	 What do you mean you quit?! You can\xc2\x92t quit!'
Joey	 Why not?!'
Rachel	 Because you\xc2\x92re not finished yet and I won\xc2\x92t have it! Greens do\nnot quit!'
Joey	 Greens? I\xc2\x92m a Tribbiani! And Tribbianis quit!'
Rachel	 Oh my God, wait did I\xc2\x97I just said Greens don\xc2\x92t quit\ndidn\xc2\x92t I? (Pause) (Angrily) Did I just say Greens don\xc2\x92t quit?!'
Joey	 Yes! Yes! You did and you\xc2\x92re still yelling at me!'
Rachel	 No! No! No! I\xc2\x92m not yelling at you, I\xc2\x92m just yelling near you.\nOh God Joey, ohh I\xc2\x92m my father. Oh my God, this is horrible! I\xc2\x92ve been trying so\nhard not to be my mother I did not see this comin\xc2\x92. Oh, Joey, I\xc2\x92m sorry.\nI\xc2\x92m so sorry. I just wanted you to learn.'
Joey	 Well, hey I did learn.'
Rachel	 Really?'
Joey	 Yeah! Come on.'
Rachel	 Awww\xc2\x85'
Joey	 Yeah, it\xc2\x92s okay. I know what a mainsail is. (Points to it. It\xc2\x92s\nthe larger sail.) I know, I know to duck when the boom comes across. I-I know port is\nright.'
Rachel	 Left.'
Joey	 Damnit!'
Phoebe	 Y\xc2\x92know, I bet it would actually make my grandmother very happy to\nknow that we\xc2\x92re trying to figure out her recipe. I bet she\xc2\x92s l-l-lookin\xc2\x92 up\nat us and smiling right now.'
Ross	 Looking up?'
Phoebe	 Oh yeah\xc2\x97No, she was really nice to me, but she\xc2\x92s in hell for\nsure.'
Monica	 Well, I\xc2\x92ve tried everything. I give up. I guess I\xc2\x92m not gonna\nbe the mom who makes the world\xc2\x92s best chocolate cookies. I do make the best duck\nconfit with broccoli rabe.\xc2\xa0 Kids love that right.'
Ross	 Aww, Pheeb, come on isn\xc2\x92t there any relative that would have the\nrecipe? What about, what about your sister?'
Phoebe	 Oh no-no, no, I made a promise to myself that the next time I would talk\nto Ursula would be over my dead body. And that\xc2\x92s not happening \xc2\x91til October 15th,\n2032.'
Ross	 That\xc2\x92s the day you\xc2\x92re gonna die? See\xc2\x97darnit, I\xc2\x92ve got\nshuffleboard that day.'
Phoebe	 That\xc2\x92s what you think.'
Monica	 Well, I mean what about friends of your grandmother\xc2\x92s?\nWouldn\xc2\x92t they have the recipe?'
Phoebe	 Well, y\xc2\x92know I may have relatives in France who would know. My\ngrandmother said she got the recipe from her grandmother, Nesele Tolouse.'
Monica	 What was her name?'
Phoebe	 Nesele Toulouse.'
Monica	 Nestle Tollhouse?!'
Phoebe	 Oh, you Americans always butcher the French language.'
Monica	 (grabbing a bag of Nestle Tollhouse chocolate chips) Phoebe, is this\nthe recipe? (Tosses her the bag.)'
Phoebe	 (reading the recipe on the back of the bag) Yes!! (Realizes.) Ohh.'
Monica	 I cannot believe that I just spent the last two days trying to figure\nout the recipe and it was in my cupboard the whole time!'
Phoebe	 I know! You see it is stuff like this which is why (Looking down)\nyou\xc2\x92re burning in hell!!'
Chandler	 So you understand, I\xc2\x92d feel a lot more comfortable if you\ndidn\xc2\x92t tell people what happened. Y\xc2\x92know, I\xc2\x92m a little\xc2\x85I\xc2\x92m a\nlittle embarrassed about it.'
Mr. Geller	 I understand completely, there\xc2\x92s nothing more horrifying than\nembarrassing yourself in front of your in-laws. As a matter of fact, when I started dating\nJudy I was unemployed, and her father asked me what I did for a living and I told him I\nwas a lawyer.'
Chandler	 What did you do when they found out?'
Mr. Geller	 They never did, so if ever see me giving them legal advice just nod\nalong. Shall we? '
Chandler	 So I guess we wear swimsuits in here!'

Rachel	 Well Joey, I hate to admit it, your way of sailing is a lot more fun.'
Joey	 Yeah, yeah. Hey, why don\xc2\x92t you give a pull on that rope? (Points.)'
Rachel	 Ohh we\xc2\x92re not sailing.'
Joey	 Just pull on it.'
Rachel	 All right. (She does so and it brings the cooler closer together.)\nHey-hey-hey!! (Sees what\xc2\x92s in the cooler.) Sandwiches!'
Joey	 What else?'
Rachel	 (hands him one) Here you go.'
Joey	 Thank you.'
Rachel	 Oh wow! (She takes a bite, but holds the sandwich vertically so that the\nstuff falls out.)'
Joey	 What are you doing?'
Rachel	 Ohh, sorry.'
Joey	 What you\xc2\x97don\xc2\x92t hold it like that! You\xc2\x92re lettin\xc2\x92 all\nthe good stuff fall out.'
Rachel	 Ohh whoops.'
Joey	 Careful! You\xc2\x92re wasting good pastrami! (Gasps.) Oh my God! I\xc2\x92m my\ndad!'
