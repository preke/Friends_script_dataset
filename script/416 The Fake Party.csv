Monica	 What is it hon?'
Phoebe	 I-I can\xc2\x92t find anything that I want to eat! Everything I eat makes\nme nauseous! I\xc2\x92m telling you, being pregnant is no piece of cake\xc2\x97ooh! Cake!\n(Chandler shrugs, and Phoebe grimaces.) No.'
Monica	 Aww, honey I\xc2\x92m sorry.'
Phoebe	 God! Ooh! What is that smell? It\xc2\x92s coming from the bathroom. Ooh!\n(She goes to the bathroom.)'
Chandler	 Wow! Pregnancy does give you some weird cravings.'
Joey	 Yeah?'
Phoebe	 It\xc2\x92s me. It\xc2\x92s Phoebe. Listen there\xc2\x92s something in here I\nwant to eat, what-what smells so good?'
Joey	 Is it the shampoo? It\xc2\x92s guava.'
Phoebe	 (she smells his head) No!'
Joey	 Oh! Wait-wait! (Reaches inside the shower.) Is it my bologna sandwich?'
Phoebe	 Yes. Yes. Yes. I can\xc2\x92t believe it! The baby wants bologna! Maybe he\nwants me to eat meat? I can\xc2\x92t eat meat!'
Joey	 Oh, wait-wait! (Reaches into the shower again.) Maybe it\xc2\x92s a pickle?!'

Chandler	 What are you writing?'
Rachel	 Well, Joshua\xc2\x92s coming in tomorrow and since I don\xc2\x92t have the\nguts to ask him out, I\xc2\x92m going to sell him a coat and put this note in the pocket.'
Chandler	 Oh yeah? (He grabs the pad and starts reading it.) Joshua, give me a\ncall sometime, guys like you (Pause) never go out of style\xc2\x97what did you throw away?'
Chandler	 Hi guys!'
All	 Hey!'
Joey	 Hey, what have you guys been up too?'
Ross	 Oh, we went to see a collection of Victorian doorknobs and the\nCupert-Hewitt museum.'
Chandler	 Without me?!'
Emily	 My uncle dragged us there. But, it actually it turned out to be really\ninteresting.'
Ross	 Yeah.'
Emily	 They were so ornate and beautiful, I mean look at that! (Shows them a\ndoorknob she has.)'
Monica	 I don\xc2\x92t know how museums work in England but, here, you\xc2\x92re not\nsupposed to take stuff.'
Emily	 I uh, I got it from the gift shop. They have really lax security there.\n(Chandler is shocked.) It\xc2\x92s a joke. (They all laugh.)'
Ross	 Bye. (They kiss.)'
Emily	 Right, I\xc2\x92ve got to be off, I\xc2\x92ll see ya. Buh-bye then. (She\nleaves.)'
Joey	 Wow! You guys seem to be having a good time.'
Ross	 Oh yeah, she\xc2\x92s-she\xc2\x92s amazing. And-and she\xc2\x92s so much fun.\nAnd! Y\xc2\x92know what? When I\xc2\x92m with her, I\xc2\x92m fun! I even signed up for\nhelicopter classes. (Chandler is shocked.) She\xc2\x92s leaving in two days, I don\xc2\x92t\nhave to do it.'
Monica	 Oh no, two days, you must be bummed.'
Ross	 Yeah, she\xc2\x92s got to go back to London. But you know what? I\xc2\x92ve\nbeen prepared for this from the start. We both knew we had two weeks together, and\nthat\xc2\x92s it. Y\xc2\x92know.'
Joey	 Hey that\xc2\x92s what all my relationships are like.'
Chandler	 Yes, but in Ross\xc2\x92s case, they both know in two weeks\nthat\xc2\x92s it.'
Ross	 Pheebs!'
All	 Hey!'
Ross	 (starts rubbing her belly) Hello! Hello!'
Phoebe	 (angered by the rubbing) Yes! I know! I know! Yeah! So the baby is\ntotally craving meat. This afternoon I tried tricking it, I made it a soy-burger to make\nit think it was getting meat, y\xc2\x92know? And I got nauseous.'
Chandler	 Maybe that\xc2\x92s because soy-burgers suck!'
Phoebe	 Being pregnant is tough on your tummy.'
Joey	 Hey, but at least you got that cool, pregnant lady glow.'
Phoebe	 That\xc2\x92s sweat. You throw up all morning, you\xc2\x92ll have that glow\ntoo.'
Joshua	 (coming in from a changing room) Okay!'
Rachel	 Oh, here\xc2\x92s that trench-coat that you wanted.'
Joshua	 Oh great! (He tries on the coat.) Wow! Yeah, it\xc2\x92s comfortable. '
Rachel	 Yeah?'
Joshua	 Man, I could really flash somebody in this thing. (He goes to put his\nhands in his pockets.)'
Rachel	 (stopping him) Oh no-no, no-no, they don\xc2\x92t want you to put your\nhands in the pockets until you are out of the store.'
Joshua	 Why not?!'
Rachel	 Well, that\xc2\x92s because of a lot of\xc2\x85(She imitates someone picking\ntheir nose and placing the treasure found in the pockets.)'
Joshua	 Y\xc2\x92know, they ruin it for everybody.'
Rachel	 I know!'
Joshua	 Y\xc2\x92know, I wore that cashmere sweater on a date last night.'
Rachel	 Oh?'
Joshua	 Yeah, it was my first date since the uh, since the divorce.'
Rachel	 Well, congratulations, so do you love her?'
Joshua	 No, no, no, she\xc2\x92s nice but, y\xc2\x92know, it just it made me realize\nthat I\xc2\x92m just not, I\xc2\x92m just not ready to be dating, y\xc2\x92know?'
Rachel	 Huh. Well, uh, that\xc2\x92s uh, that\xc2\x92s interesting. (She goes over\nand retrieves her note.)'
Joshua	 (noticing her) Hey-whoa-hey-hey, what was that?'
Rachel	 Oh, it\xc2\x92s just an anti-theft device.'
Joshua	 Then uh, what\xc2\x92s-what\xc2\x92s this? (Shows her the real anti-theft\ndevice.)'
Rachel	 You need that, you need that too \xc2\x91cause obviously, a thief could\njust tear this up. (Rips up the note.)'
Rachel	 Oops, sorry. Listen, we-we have to have a party tonight! Actually, we\nhave to have one in five minutes, so everybody cancel your plans.'
Chandler	 What are you talking about?'
Joey	 Yeah, what\xc2\x92 going on?'
Rachel	 We have to have a surprise Bon Voyage party for Emily. But it\xc2\x92s\nactually for Joshua. (Starts handing out party hats.) Look, he said he\xc2\x92s not ready to\ndate, so I had to invite him to a party if I wanted to see him outside of work, and now I\nhave the perfect opportunity to seduce him! (Hands Ross a party hat.)'
Ross	 Well, as much as I\xc2\x92d like to meet Josh and warn him, Emily and I\naren\xc2\x92t going to be here. All right? I mean, she\xc2\x92s going to come by first to say\ngood-bye, and then I\xc2\x92ve got a whole special evening planned. So I\xc2\x92m sorry, no\nparty.'
Joey	 Awwww!'
Emily	 (entering) Hello?'
Rachel	 Surprise!!!'
Emily	 No one\xc2\x92s ever thrown me a surprise party before!'
Rachel	 Well, it was all Ross\xc2\x92s idea.'
Emily	 You\xc2\x92re so sweet! And I\xc2\x92m so surprised!'
Ross	 You really didn\xc2\x92t know?'
Chandler	 Why are you in here if Joshua is all the way over there? (Points to\nthe living room.)'
Rachel	 Uhh, because I\xc2\x92m trying to play hard to get. Oh, quick he\xc2\x92s\nlooking over here, say something funny.'
Chandler	 Like what?'
Joey	 What-what-what is so funny?'
Chandler	 I said, "Like what?"'
Joey	 Now that\xc2\x92s a thinker.'
Rachel	 Okay, y\xc2\x92know what, y\xc2\x92know what? This playing hard to get thing\nis not working. Umm, hand-hand me those cherries. (Chandler does so.) Okay. Okay. (She\ndoes a little sexy walk over to where Joshua is standing.) Hi!'
Joshua	 Hi!'
Rachel	 Care for a cherry?'
Joshua	 Oh, no thanks.'
Rachel	 No? Y\xc2\x92know, I can tie one of these into a knot using just my\ntongue. '
Joshua	 You okay? (Rachel swallowed it whole and is not hacking like a heavy\nsmoker in the morning.) You all right? (Rachel walks away, coughing.)'
Ross	 (interrupting Monica and Emily) So we should probably get going soon.'
Emily	 Oh, but the party\xc2\x92s only just getting started!'
Ross	 Yeah, but we-we have to be at the Four Seasons for drinks in 15\nminutes and then y\xc2\x92know, then The Plaza for dinner.'
Emily	 So why did you plan a party at the same time?'
Ross	 No-no-no, no, umm, actually American surprise parties are-are-are very\nshort. It\xc2\x92s usually, "Surprise!" And then, "Oh my God, I\xc2\x92m so\nsurprised\xc2\x97good-bye!"'
Emily	 But Ross, I\xc2\x92m such having a great time! Your sister has just been\ntelling me that you used to dress up like little, old ladies and hold make-believe tea\nparties.'
Ross	 Monica said that did she? (He squeezes Monica\xc2\x92s knee really hardly\nand Monica winces in pain.)'
Phoebe	 Ooh, yeah. Then what are you going to put on top of that?'
Joey	 A little salami. '
Phoebe	 Ooh yeah! Then umm, what goes on top of the salami?'
Joey	 Pastrami. '
Phoebe	 Oooh, yeah. You\xc2\x92re a genius.'
Rachel	 Oh, could somebody give me a hand with this zipper?'
Joey	 Yeah. (He goes over to her.)'
Rachel	 Up!'
Monica	 You changed?'
Rachel	 Yeah, I did. I needed my lucky dress.'
Monica	 And lucky means, more cleavage? '
Chandler	 Does for me.'
Rachel	 Ohh, God! Look at him, he\xc2\x92s so cute. I wanna go over there, grab\nhim, and kiss him! How can I kiss him and not letting him know that I like him?'

Monica	 Or if you want to kiss him, umm, you could use mistletoe.'
Rachel	 It\xc2\x92s not Christmas!'
Monica	 Or Spin the Bottle?'
Rachel	 He\xc2\x92s not 11!'
Emily	 (with her coat on, she\xc2\x92s leaving with Ross) Thank you so much for\nthis. It was really so thoughtful of you.'
Rachel	 What? You\xc2\x92re leaving?!'
Ross	 Yes, we have something we have to get to.'

Ross	 (stopping them) Okay, that-that\xc2\x92s enough! Y\xc2\x92know, let\xc2\x92s,\nlet\xc2\x92s let someone else play.'
Joey	 If you didn\xc2\x92t want to play, why did you come to the party?'
Rachel	 Okay, my turn!!'

All	 Oh my God!'
Rachel	 All right, well, everybody just remember where they were sitting. '
Rachel	 Just a bug.'

Phoebe	 Y\xc2\x92know it doesn\xc2\x92t matter how much I\xc2\x92m craving it.\nY\xc2\x92know why I\xc2\x92m never gonna eat meat? Because it\xc2\x92s murder, cold blooded\nmurder.'
Chandler	 Okay. '
Chandler	 There\xc2\x92s a Phoebe on my sandwich! (He walks away, giving the\nsandwich to Phoebe.)'
Joey	 Phoebe, what-what are you doing?!'
Phoebe	 I can\xc2\x92t help it. I need the meat. The baby needs the meat.'
Joey	 All right look, y\xc2\x92know how-y\xc2\x92know how when you\xc2\x92re dating\nsomeone and you don\xc2\x92t want to cheat on them, unless it\xc2\x92s with someone really\nhot?'
Phoebe	 Yeah, totally!'
Joey	 All right. Okay. Well this is the same kind of deal. If you\xc2\x92re going\nto do something wrong, (He grabs two steaks from the freezer) do it right!'
Joey	 Feel better now?'
Phoebe	 Yeah, but at what cost? Six more months, three meals a day, I\xc2\x92m\ngonna eat like, y\xc2\x92know millions of cows.'
Joey	 Hey, what if I said, I could even things out for ya, meatwise.'
Phoebe	 What?'
Joey	 Well, I eat a lot of meat right?'
Phoebe	 Yeah.'
Joey	 Well, suppose until the baby\xc2\x92s born I laid off it. No extra animals\nwould die, you-you\xc2\x92d just be eating my animals.'
Phoebe	 Joey, I can\xc2\x92t believe you would do that for me.'
Joey	 Absolutely! I could be a vegetarian. There\xc2\x92s no meat in beer, right?'
Ross	 Okay, we could still make dinner if we skipped the appetisers and asked\nfor our check right away.'
Emily	 But, we can\xc2\x92t go now. It looks like Rachel\xc2\x92s gonna put on a\nskit.'
Monica	 Oh my God! Have you lost your mind?'
Rachel	 No-n-n-n-no! I am finally thinking clearly. My lucky dress\nwasn\xc2\x92t working out to well for me, but for four years, this baby never missed.'
Monica	 Rachel-Rachel-Rachel I-I cannot, I can\xc2\x92t let\xc2\x97(pause), actually\nI kinda want to see what happens.'

A lot of memories in here, a lot of memories. If these walls could\ntalk, y\xc2\x92know what they\xc2\x92d say? Wanna hear some memories? (She is now violently\npulling on her bra in order to remove it, but it isn\xc2\x92t co-operating.)'
Joshua	 Need uh, need a little hand there.'
Rachel	 Oh no-no-no! No, I got this all under control.'
Joshua	 You really don\xc2\x92t seem like you do. That\xc2\x92s\xc2\x85'
Rachel	 Ughhhh!! Forget it! (Sits down heavily on the bed.) This is, this is not\nhow this is supposed to happen.'
Joshua	 Well, what was supposed to happen?'
Rachel	 Can you not look at me when I say this? (He turns around) I thought that\nif I could get you here, I could seduce you.'
Joshua	 Huh. Oh, boy! (Sits down next to her.) Uhh, I-I don\xc2\x92t wear suits to\nwork, and I bought six of them from you.'
