Rachel	 Yeah. Don\xc2\x92t do this to yourself.'
Phoebe	 She\xc2\x92s made it pretty clear, it is not going to happen.'
Joey	 Well all right then, I guess I shouldn\xc2\x92t get to excited about the\nfact (excitedly) that I just kissed her!'
Monica	 You serious?!'
Chandler	 That\xc2\x92s great!'
Monica	 Really?!'

Janine	 Okay, now I\xc2\x92m really late. (Gets up.)'
Joey	 Okay, I\xc2\x92m all right, okay, but hey, could you just leave your lips?\n(She kisses him on the cheek and starts to leave.)'
Janine	 (to Monica and Rachel) Bye.'
Monica	 Bye. (Janine exits.)'
Joey	 Have you kissed her yet? It\xc2\x92s awesome! I could do it forever!\nY\xc2\x92know what? She-she kisses better than my mom cooks!'
Monica	 I am so glad you said cooks.'
Rachel	 I know.'
Chandler	 (entering) Oh hey Rachel, sweetheart? You have got to tell the\npost office that you have moved. Okay? We are still getting all your bills and stuff.\n(Hands her all of her bills and stuff.)'
Rachel	 Oh-oh, Pottery Barn! (Grabs the aforementioned catalog and holds\nthe rest back out to Chandler.) You can throw the rest away.'
Chandler	 I\xc2\x92m not your garbage man. I\xc2\x92m your mailman.'
Rachel	 Monica look! Look-look-look! Here is that table that I ordered. (Shows\nher the picture.)'
Monica	 You got it from Pottery Barn?!'
Rachel	 Yeah! It\xc2\x92s an apothecary table. Does anyone even know what an\napothecary is?'
Chandler	 A pharmacist. (Rachel mocks him.)'
Monica	 Rach, Phoebe hates Pottery Barn.'
Joey	 I hate Pottery Barn too. They kicked me out of there just because I\nsat on a bed!'
Chandler	 You took off your pants and climbed under the sheets!'
Joey	 (indignant) I was tired!'
Rachel	 Phoebe hates Pottery Barn?!'
Monica	 Yeah, she hates all mass produced stuff. She thinks her furniture should\nhave a history, a story behind it.'
Rachel	 Well this has story behind it! I mean they had to ship it all the way\nfrom the White Plains store.'
Monica	 It\xc2\x92s gotta be one of a kind. Y\xc2\x92know like umm, y\xc2\x92know uh,\nwhat\xc2\x92s that God awful ceramic fruit bowl she has on her counter?'
Joey	 Hey! I made that for her!'
Chandler	 You made pottery?'
Joey	 Yeah! I made it of this fruit bowl I found in the garbage.'
Monica	 I\xc2\x92m telling\xc2\x97If you put that in her apartment you\xc2\x92ll never\nhear the end of it.'
Rachel	 Okay fine! I\xc2\x92ll-I\xc2\x92ll just tell her it\xc2\x92s an antique\napothecary table, she doesn\xc2\x92t have to know where it came from. Oh! Look at this\nlittle drawers! Oh look-look it says that it holds 300 CDs.'
Chandler	 Ahh, just like the apothecary tables of yore\xc2\x85'
Chandler	 \xc2\x85so then the farmer says, "That\xc2\x92s not a cow and\nyou\xc2\x92re not milking it." (Everyone laughs.) '
Monica	 I am so glad you guys got together, Chandler and I are always looking\nfor a couple to go out with and now we have one!'
Chandler	 Look at us, we\xc2\x92re a couple of couples!'
Janine	 I had so much fun tonight, and what a great restaurant.'
Monica	 Yeah.'
Joey	 And Chandler I can\xc2\x92t believe I let you pay for this one. (They hug\nand he whispers in his ear.) Thanks man.'
Monica	 So do you guys gonna come over tomorrow? I\xc2\x92ll make that pasta thing\nI was telling you about.'
Janine	 Oh that would be great!'
Joey	 Oh, but hey look, at least let us bring the wine.'
Monica	 Joey, you don\xc2\x92t have too!'
Joey	 Nope-op! I insist! (He hugs Chandler again and whispers to him.) You get\nthe wine right?'
Chandler	 Yeah all right. (They part.) Okay, good night guys.'
Joey	 See ya tomorrow!'
Monica	 Tomorrow!'
Janine	 Can\xc2\x92t wait! (They each go into their respective apartments.)'
Janine	 How are we gonna get out of that one?'
Joey	 What?'
Janine	 I can\xc2\x92t handle two nights in a row with them.'
Joey	 What-what\xc2\x92s wrong with Monica and Chandler?'
Janine	 I don\xc2\x92t know, they\xc2\x92re just a little blah!'
Joey	 Blah?!'
Janine	 Well y\xc2\x92know, he\xc2\x92s blah, she\xc2\x92s just\xc2\x97she\xc2\x92s very\nloud for such a small person.'
Joey	 Uh, they\xc2\x92re like my best friends. Are you saying we can\xc2\x92t hang\nout with them? \xc2\x91Cause that would kinda be a problem.'
Janine	 No! Of course we can still hang out with them. Just y\xc2\x92know, not two\nnights in a row. Okay?'
Joey	 I guess.'
Janine	 Thank you. (They kiss.)'
Joey	 If you want, I\xc2\x92ll sell my friends and use the money to buy you\npresents.'
Phoebe	 Hey!'
Rachel	 Hey!'
Phoebe	 (sees the table) Ooh, what a great table! Where-where did you get it?'
Rachel	 Guess!'
Phoebe	 Umm, a flea market?'
Rachel	 Ha! See, I knew, I knew you\xc2\x92d get it on the first guess. Isn\xc2\x92t\nit cool! It\xc2\x92s an apothecary table.'
Phoebe	 Wow! Oh you can just imagine that this is where (She\xc2\x92s opening and\nclosing the drawers) they kept all the stuff to make their potions.'
Rachel	 Ohh, yes.'
Phoebe	 Y\xc2\x92know? Ooh, you can almost smell the opium.'
Rachel	 Almost.'
Phoebe	 How much was it?'
Rachel	 It was only 500 bucks.'
Phoebe	 500 bucks at a flea market?!'
Rachel	 Oh, okay see I thought, I thought you meant how much was it when it was\nnew, y\xc2\x92know like back then.'
Phoebe	 Oh no.'
Rachel	 Yeah no, I mean it was at a flea market, so it was y\xc2\x92know, it was\nlike a dollar.'
Phoebe	 A dollar?'
Rachel	 And fifty. So it was like one and fifty dollars.'
Phoebe	 Ohh, okay, they gave you the old time pricing.'
Rachel	 Yeah.'
Phoebe	 Well, what period is it from?'
Rachel	 Uh, it\xc2\x92s from yore. Like the days of yore. Y\xc2\x92know?'
Phoebe	 Yes, yes I do. God, oh it\xc2\x92s just perfect! Wow! I bet it has a great\nstory behind it too. Did they tell you anything? Like y\xc2\x92know where it was from\nor\xc2\x85'
Rachel	 Yes! That I know, this is from White Plains.'
Phoebe	 (gasps) White Plains. Oh, it sounds like such a magical place.'
Rachel	 Hey! We\xc2\x92re here!'
Ross	 Hey!'
Rachel	 (seeing his new table) Ohh! Oh my God!'
Ross	 You like it? '
Rachel	 Oh no!'
Ross	 It\xc2\x92s my new apothecary table!'
Rachel	 Ross! Phoebe\xc2\x92s gonna be here any second, she cannot see this!'
Ross	 Well why not?! She\xc2\x92ll-she\xc2\x92ll love it! It\xc2\x92s the real thing!\nI got it at Pottery Barn.'
Rachel	 I know you did! I bought the same one! And if she sees your table\nshe\xc2\x92s gonna know that I lied to her. I told her ours was an original.'
Ross	 Why did you do that?'
Rachel	 Because she hates Pottery Barn.'
Ross	 She hates Pottery Barn?!!'
Rachel	 I know! I know, she says it\xc2\x92s all mass-produced, nothing is\nauthentic, and everyone winds up having the same stuff. (Ross looks at his table.) So come\non, she\xc2\x92s gonna be here any second! Can we please just cover this up with something?!\nPlease?'
Ross	 What? No! No! I am not gonna hide it from Phoebe\xc2\x97Ooh, although I did\nget some great Pottery Barn sheets! (Gets them.)'
Rachel	 Ooo! Oh, I forgot they made sheets!'
Ross	 Uh, yeah! I still can\xc2\x92t believe she hates Pottery Barn!'
Rachel	 Ross, get over it! It\xc2\x92s not like she hates you.'
Ross	 Yeah but Pottery Barn! Y\xc2\x92know what I think? It\xc2\x92s just\nshe-she\xc2\x92s weird. Y\xc2\x92know it\xc2\x92s because she\xc2\x92s a twin. Twins are weird.'
Rachel	 Ross, she\xc2\x92s not weird, she just wants her stuff to be one of a\nkind.'
Ross	 Huh. Y\xc2\x92know what\xc2\x92s not one of a kind? A twin!'
Phoebe	 (entering) Hey!'
Rachel	 Hey!'
Ross	 Hey!'
Rachel	 Ooh, Phoebe\xc2\x92s here! Okay, let\xc2\x92s turn out all the lights and\nwe\xc2\x92ll just watch the movie!'

Ross	 Oh, you like it? You wanna know where I got it? '
Phoebe	 Sure!'
Rachel	 He got it a flea market!'
Phoebe	 You bought your sheets at a flea market? Ross come on, you gotta loosen\nthe purse strings a little.'
Monica	 Hey!'
Joey	 Hi!'
Monica	 The dinner will be ready in twenty minutes. This is so exciting.'
Chandler	 And here is the bottle of wine for you to bring over tonight. (Hands\nit to him.) You were also going to buy Monica flowers but you couldn\xc2\x92t afford it,\nbecause you paid dinner last night.'
Joey	 Thanks. Thanks, but uh actually it\xc2\x92s just gonna be me again tonight.'
Monica	 What happened to Janine?'
Joey	 Oh, she\xc2\x92s uh-uh really sick.'
Chandler	 Oh that\xc2\x92s too bad.'
Joey	 Yeah, she\xc2\x92s been in there all day (Points to her room), uh high\nfever, a nose problem\xc2\x85 Phlegm! Phlegm! Phlegm-phlegm-phlegm!'
Janine	 (entering from her room) Monica! Chandler! I\xc2\x92m really-really sorry\nabout tonight. I don\xc2\x92t know if Joey told you; I just couldn\xc2\x92t get out of going\nto this play. I\xc2\x92m sorry. Have a great time.'
Joey	 \xc2\x91Kay!'
Janine	 Bye. (Exits)'
Chandler	 That\xc2\x92s funny, I saw no phlegm.'

Joey	 No-no, she really is sick!'
Chandler	 Then why-why is she going to a play?!'
Joey	 Uh, y\xc2\x92know, starve a fever, go to a play for a cold.'
Monica	 Joey! Why is Janine not coming over for dinner?!'
Joey	 Well uh, she didn\xc2\x92t want to hang out with you guys two nights in a\nrow. I\xc2\x92m so sorry.'
Chandler	 Well, why does she not want to hang out with us?!'
Joey	 Because she uh, she-she thinks that you are blah and that you, Monica, are\ntoo loud.'
Monica	 (loudly) What?!! (Quietly) What?'
Chandler	 So she was just pretending to have a good time last night? She was\nlying to our faces?!'
Monica	 Ugh, I can not believe this! I mean, who is she to judge us? We could\nnot have been nicer to her!'
Chandler	 And I am not blah, I am a hoot!'
Joey	 I know! I know! Come on, please-please you guys, don\xc2\x92t-don\xc2\x92t be\nmad. I\xc2\x92m sure she just, she just said that stuff because she was nervous and you guys\nare like my best friends! Y\xc2\x92know? And it was our first date! Plus, she\xc2\x92s really\nsick!'
Chandler	 No, you sh\xc2\x97No you said you made that up!!'
Joey	 I know, but don\xc2\x92t you think the sick thing is way better than the\nplay thing?'
Chandler	 Eh, they\xc2\x92re both good. I generally just go with, Monica\xc2\x92s\ndrunk again. (Monica glares at him.) '
Joey	 Come on you guys, come on please-please just give her another chance, huh?\nShe\xc2\x92ll come around I promise.'
Monica	 Of course we will, come on we gotta make dinner.'
Chandler	 Okay.'
Monica	 (from the hallway) I do not like that woman!'
Joey	 (shouting) I can hear you!'
Monica	 I am loud!'
All	 Aww! (They all laugh.)'
Rachel	 That\xc2\x92s funny. (Phoebe puts her feet up on Ross\xc2\x92s table.)'
Ross	 Hey Pheebs, could you please not put your feet up on my new\xc2\x85(On\nRachel\xc2\x92s glare)\xc2\x85old sheet?'
Phoebe	 Oh sure! (She goes to take her feet off, but drags the sheet with her\nwhich spills the wine.) Noo!'
Rachel	 Ohh!!'
Ross	 My apothecary table!!!'
Phoebe	 What?!'
Rachel	 Noooooo!! (Phoebe lifts up the sheet to discover the exact same\napothecary table they have.) '
Phoebe	 Ross, where did you get this?!'
Ross	 I got it at Pottery Barn!! Okay?!'
Rachel	 Oh my God, Phoebe, Pottery Barn has ripped off the design of our\nantique!'
Phoebe	 Wow! Oh my God, well if they\xc2\x92ve ripped off our table ours must be\nmuch more than one and fifty dollars!'
Rachel	 Oh yes.'
Phoebe	 Well this doesn\xc2\x92t even smell like opium.'
Ross	 Of course not, it smells like wine, which you spilled! And thanks for\nwrecking my sheet by the way.'
Phoebe	 Oh Ross, calm down, I\xc2\x92ll give you the 80 cents. (Ross glares at\nRachel)'
Chandler	 Okay, one more time.'
Monica	 Chandler, would you like some more orange juice?'
Chandler	 Perfect decibel.'
Monica	 (loudly) I know!!!'
Joey	 (entering) Hey!'
Chandler	 Hey.'
Joey	 So uh, what are you guys doing?'
Chandler	 Oh nothing, we\xc2\x92re just talking. Y\xc2\x92know, blah-blah-blah.'
Joey	 Look, come on you guys, you said you were gonna try! All right look, I\ncame over here to invite you guys to a movie with me and Janine.'
Monica	 Well, I\xc2\x92d like to but, (extremely quietly) I\xc2\x92m not sure we\nhave time to go.'
Joey	 Ha-ha, very funny\xc2\x97Look! I don\xc2\x92t know what to do! I really want\nyou guys to get along. Just please come to the movie with us. I mean you owe me!'
Monica	 We owe you?!'
Joey	 That\xc2\x92s right! I helped you guys out a lot in the start of your\nrelationship. Huh? I helped you guys sneak around for like six months, and I looked like\nan idiot! And I was humiliated. And I only made 200 dollars!'
Monica	 We didn\xc2\x92t give you any money! (Chandler is motioning,\n"No!")'
Joey	 You don\xc2\x92t think I know that!'
Rachel	 \xc2\x85see I can\xc2\x92t decide whether it would go better next to the new\nwicker dining chair, the Sahara desk, or the Parker console table.'
Ross	 Wow! I didn\xc2\x92t know that there was a Pottery Barn up here.'
Rachel	 I know, I know. I went a little crazy.'
Ross	 A little? Your place looks like page 72 of the catalogue. Oh look at that!\nThe ornamental bird cage! Large!'
Phoebe	 (entering) Hey!'
Rachel	 Hey.'
Phoebe	 (sees Ross) Oh Ross no. Be careful, that is very old! Okay? Early\nColonial bird merchants used to bring their birds to market in that.'
Ross	 (glaring at Rachel) Fascinating.'
Phoebe	 (gasps) Another amazing find! Wow! Oh I bet this has a great story too!'
Rachel	 Oh it does, it does! It is a room separating apparatus from Colonial\ntimes.'
Phoebe	 Ah!'
Ross	 Hmm, a lot of this stuff is from Colonial times. Hey, what are some other\ntime periods Rachel? (She glares at him.)'
Rachel	 Well there\xc2\x92s yore. And uh, y\xc2\x92know, yesteryear.'
Phoebe	 Yeah no, I\xc2\x92m telling you Rachel has such a great eye for this\nstuff. Ross, y\xc2\x92know if you ever decide you need to redecorate\xc2\x97And I think that\nyou should. You should, you should ask Rachel to help.'
Rachel	 Oh honey he doesn\xc2\x92t need my help.'
Phoebe	 Oh, come on! I think he\xc2\x92s ready to get rid of, what did you call\nit? The cheap knock-offs and dinosaur junk.'
Ross	 Really?! (To Rachel) Hey, y\xc2\x92know what? Since you have such a great\nsense of what I need, uh ooh, here\xc2\x92s-here\xc2\x92s 60 bucks, why don\xc2\x92t you take\nPhoebe down to that Colonial flea market of yours and get me some stuff.'
Rachel	 (not sure of what to do) Y\xc2\x92know what? I don\xc2\x92t, I don\xc2\x92t\nthink Phoebe really wants to come.'
Phoebe	 No! I do want to!'
Rachel	 Oh, she does want to.'
Ross	 She does want to.'
Phoebe	 Yeah!'
Rachel	 Pheebs, I don\xc2\x92t know what to say. I guess the flea market was just\nbetter last time.'
Phoebe	 Well at least I got these sheets for Ross.'
Rachel	 Yeah.'
Phoebe	 Uck, look at this! Pottery Barn, yuck!'
Rachel	 Yeah, y\xc2\x92know what? Don\xc2\x92t look at it. (Realizes the display is\ntheir living room) Seriously, don\xc2\x92t look at it. (Tries to pull Phoebe away.)'
Phoebe	 No! Look-look! There\xc2\x92s the coffee table they stole from us!'
Rachel	 Ugh, those bastards! Let\xc2\x92s go.'
Phoebe	 That fan kinda looks like ours. And the birdcage and the\xc2\x85wait a\nsec! This is our exact living room!'
Rachel	 No! No! No! No it\xc2\x92s not! No it\xc2\x92s not! Come on! Phoebe, ours is\ntotally different! I mean we don\xc2\x92t have the\xc2\x85 (Looks desperately for something\ndifferent.) We don\xc2\x92t have the\xc2\x85that lamp! And-and that screen is y\xc2\x92know, on\nthe other side.'
Phoebe	 Oh my God. This is where you got all our stuff, Pottery Barn! Oh\nmy God!'
Rachel	 Okay! Okay-okay look\xc2\x97no I did, I just wanted this stuff and I know\nhow you feel about Pottery Barn. Just\xc2\x85 Come on don\xc2\x92t be mad.'
Phoebe	 No-no-no, but I am mad! I am mad! Because this stuff is everything that\nis wrong with the world! And it\xc2\x92s all sitting up in my living room and all I can\nthink about is how I don\xc2\x92t have that lamp!'
Rachel	 Well then honey, buy the lamp! Hey, we have that 60 bucks from Ross.'
Phoebe	 I can\xc2\x92t! I can\xc2\x92t! Unless\xc2\x85 Well are you saying that-that\nyou would move out if-if I didn\xc2\x92t buy that lamp?'
Rachel	 What?! No! I\xc2\x92m not gonna move out!'
Phoebe	 But are you saying that you would move out if I didn\xc2\x92t buy that\nlamp?'
Rachel	 (gets it) Oh. Yes! I would so move out!'
Phoebe	 Okay then I don\xc2\x92t have a choice! I have to buy that lamp!'
Rachel	 That\xc2\x92s right!'
Phoebe	 But at least the apothecary table is real.'
Joey	 Well, this-this-this was great. Didn\xc2\x92t everybody have a great time?'
Janine	 Well I did. I really did. And you guys, I\xc2\x92ve got to say, I\xc2\x92m\nsorry if I was a little weird after the last time we went out. I guess I was just nervous\nor something.'
Chandler	 That\xc2\x92s totally understandable.'
Monica	 Don\xc2\x92t worry about it.'
Janine	 So we can go out again?'
Chandler	 Oh yeah!'
Monica	 Absolutely!'
Janine	 Oh good.'
Joey	 Oh well then, good night!'
Monica	 Good night! (They go into their respective apartments.)'
Joey	 See? Eh, wasn\xc2\x92t that fun?'
Janine	 We have got to move!'
Monica	 (bursting in) I knew it!! Y\xc2\x92know, you\xc2\x92re not so quiet\nyourself, missy!'
Chandler	 And I\xc2\x92m blah? Listen, the only thing more boring than watching\nmodern dance is having to listen to you talk about it, (Imitating her) "Oh Chandler,\nI just lost myself in the moment."'
Janine	 Y\xc2\x92know, I know you\xc2\x92re talking, but all I hear is, "Blah.\nBlah. Blah-blah-blah."'
Monica	 (steps up and points at her) All right! You and me! Let\xc2\x92s go! Right\nnow!'
Joey	 All right! All right! Enough! Enough! Enough!! Enough! (To Chandler and\nMonica) You two go home! I-I-I gotta talk to Janine! (They start to leave.)'
Chandler	 (To Monica) Y\xc2\x92know I think you can take her.'
Monica	 (to Janine) You\xc2\x92d better hope I don\xc2\x92t see you in the hallway!!\n(They exit.)'
Joey	 All right, uh, we\xc2\x92ve got a little bit of a problem here. These people\nare my friends; you can\xc2\x92t treat them that way.'
Janine	 They said stuff to me too, y\xc2\x92know!'
Joey	 I know! I know! And I\xc2\x92m going to talk to them about it. They mean so\nmuch to me. They\xc2\x85 They\xc2\x92re like my family. If you guys are gonna be fighting all\nthe time, I-I\xc2\x85 I don\xc2\x92t think we can be together. It just, it just can\xc2\x92t\nwork. It can\xc2\x92t. (Starts to break up) I\xc2\x92m very upset.'
Janine	 Okay. Okay. Would, would it help if I went over and apologized?'
Joey	 Yeah! Yeah! That would be very helpful! Yeah. (He opens the door for her\nand she exits into the hallway.)'
Monica	 What did I tell you about the hall?!'
Janine	 I was just coming over here to apologize for my behavior! I\xc2\x92d\nreally like it if we could be friends.'
Monica	 Well, I know that would make Joey happy, so, I would like that too.'
Janine	 Great.'
Monica	 Now come on. (They hug like men.) Well, I\xc2\x92m glad we worked things\nout.'
Janine	 Me too.'
Monica	 Okay.'
Janine	 I\xc2\x92ll see you.'
Monica	 Bye. (Leaves to resume her garbage removal task.)'
Janine	 (muttering to herself) Or I\xc2\x92ll hear you.'
Monica	 (hearing that) That\xc2\x92s it big girl! (Hits Janine in the butt with\nthe garbage bag) Come on!'
Janine	 Wait! (Janine pauses, then runs down the stairs.)'
Monica	 (chasing her) You\xc2\x92d better run! '
Chandler	 Did you hear that?'
Joey	 Yeah uh, what am I gonna do?'
Chandler	 Yeah, I\xc2\x92m sorry man. (Pause) You wanna go watch?'
Joey	 Yeah! (They head downstairs.)'

Ross	 Hey!'
Joey	 How ya doin\xc2\x92?'
Chandler	 Hey so, did uh, did she move out?'
Joey	 Pretty much, yeah.'
Monica	 I cannot believe you broke up with her just like that.'
Joey	 Well, when it\xc2\x92s not right, you know it.'
Chandler	 You okay?'
Joey	 Yeah! Yeah. I\xc2\x92ll be all right.'
Ross	 Y\xc2\x92know what would cheer you up?'
Joey	 What?'
Ross	 I\xc2\x92m giving this lecture on erosion theories tomorrow night, I think\nyou should come.'
Joey	 (laughing hysterically) You\xc2\x92re right! That did cheer me up!'
