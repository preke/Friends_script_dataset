Chandler	 Ross and the most beautiful girl in the world. '
Monica	 Probably the only time I'll ever say this, but did you see the ass\non her? "
Rachel	 Huh. Well, then you'd better keep it away from Ross's hair. So this\nis pretty rare. How did you get that? "
Ross	 How do you think it's gonna look when you get her something incredibly\nmeaningful and expensive and her boyfriend Joey gives her an orange? "
Monica	 Sixty guests. '
Monica	 Thanks. Like, check out my new catering stuff. (Picks up two frying\npans) Look at this! I'm an omelet station! Omelet? Made to order! "
Ross	 (mouths "where?") Uh... Oh hey, do you, uh (steps on some garbage\nand falters) ...do you have any, um, Cinnamon Fruit Toasties? '
Chandler	 A pen.'

Monica	 Wait a minute, Phoebe! We should be partners. We should be\ncatering partners. I mean, think about it! You're not working right now, and we have such\na great time together! "
Chandler	 Happy birthday! I'm sorry. "
Chandler	 See, you think it's just a pen, but then you turn it over and it's also a\nclock. "
