Phoebe	 Do you think they have yesterday's daily news?"
Monica	 Why?'
Phoebe	 Just wanna check my horoscope, see if it was right.'
Monica	 Oh my God. (Grabs Phoebe and turns her away) Phoebe. Don't look now, but\nbehind us is a guy who has the potential to break our hearts and plunge us into a pit of\ndepression. "
Phoebe	 Where? (Turns to face him) Ooh, come to Momma.'
Monica	 He's coming. Be cool, be cool, be cool."
Guy	 Nice hat.'
Monica and Phoebe	 (in unison) Thanks.'
Phoebe	 We should do something. Whistle.'
Monica	 We are not going to whistle.'
Phoebe	 Come on, do it.'
Monica	 No!'
Phoebe	 Do it!'
Monica	 No!'
Phoebe	 Do it do it do it!'
Monica	 (Shouts to the guy) Woo-woo!'
Phoebe	 I can't believe you did that!"

Monica	 Why did I 'woo-hoo'? I mean, what was I hoping would happen? That-that\nhe'd turn round and say 'I love that sound, I must have you now'?"
Phoebe	 I just wish there was something we could do. (Bends down and talks to\nhim) Hello. Hello, Coma Guy. GET UP, YOU GIRL SCOUT! UP! UP! UP!'
Monica	 Phoebe, what are you doing?'
Phoebe	 Maybe nobody's tried this."
Monica	 I wish we at least knew his name... Look at that face. I mean, even\nsleeping, he looks smart. I bet he's a lawyer."
Phoebe	 Yeah, but did you see the dents in his knuckles? That means he's\nartistic."
Monica	 Okay, he's a lawyer, who teaches sculpting on the side. And- he can\ndance!"
Phoebe	 Oh! And, he's the kinda guy who, when you're talking, he's listening,\ny'know, and not saying 'Yeah, I understand' but really wondering what you look like naked."
Monica	 I wish all guys could be like him.'
Phoebe	 I know.'
Chandler	 Are there no conscious men in the city for you two?'
Monica	 He doesn't have anyone."
Phoebe	 Yeah, we-we feel kinda responsible.'
Joey	 I can't believe you said woowoo. I don't even say woowoo."
Rachel	 Oh, she's coming up! She's coming up! (Turns on the TV)"
Jay Leno	 (on TV) Folks, when we come back we'll be talking about her new book,\n'Euphoria Unbound'
Chandler	 Y'know, we don't have to watch this. Weekend At Bernie's is\non Showtime, HBO, and Cinemax."
Rachel	 No way, forget it.'
Joey	 C'mon, she's your mom!"
Chandler	 Exactly. Weekend At Bernie's! Dead guy getting hit in the\ngroin twenty, thirty times! No?"
Rachel	 Chandler, I gotta tell you, I love your mom's books! I love her books! I\ncannot get on a plane without one! I mean, this is so cool!"
Chandler	 Yeah, well, you wouldn't think it was cool if you're eleven years old\nand all your friends are passing around page 79 of 'Mistress Bitch.'"
Ross	 C'mon, Chandler, I love your mom. I think she's a blast."
Chandler	 You can say that because she's not your mom."
Ross	 Oh, please...'
Paolo	 Bona sera.'
Rachel	 Oh, hi sweetie. (They kiss)'
Ross	 When did Rigatoni get back from Rome?'
Monica	 Last night.'
Ross	 Ah, so then his plane didn't explode in a big ball of fire?... Just a\ndream I had- but, phew."
Phoebe	 Hey hey hey! She's on!"
Paolo	 Ah! Nora Bing!'
Jay Leno	 (on TV) ...Now what is this about you-you being arrested i-in London?\nWhat is that all about?'
Phoebe	 Your mom was arrested?'
Chandler	 Shhh, busy beaming with pride.'
Mrs. Bing	 (on TV) ...This is kind of embarrassing, but occasionally after I've\nbeen intimate with a man..."
Chandler	 Now why would she say that's embarrassing?"
All	 Shhh.'
Mrs. Bing	 (on TV) ...I just get this craving for Kung Pow Chicken.'
Chandler	 THAT'S TOO MUCH INFORMATION!!"
Jay Leno	 (on TV) Alright, so now you're doing this whole book tour thing, how\nis that going?"
Mrs. Bing	 (on TV) Oh, fine. I'm leaving for New York tomorrow, which I hate-\nbut I get to see my son, who I love..."
All	 Awww!'
Chandler	 This is the way that I find out. Most moms use the phone.'
Jay Leno	 (on TV) Y'know, don't take this wrong, I-I just don't see you a-as a\nmom, somehow.. I don't mean that, I don't mean that bad..."
Mrs. Bing	 (on TV) Oh no, I am a fabulous mom! I bought my son his first\ncondoms.'
Chandler	 ...And then he burst into flames.'
Monica	 Let's see. Congress is debating a new deficit reduction bill... the\nmayor wants to raise subway fares again... the high today was forty-five... and- oh, teams\nplayed sports."
Phoebe	 What about Glen? He could be a Glen. '
Monica	 Nah... not-not special enough.'
Phoebe	 Ooh! How about Agamemnon?'
Monica	 Waaay too special.'
Mrs. Bing	 I am famished. What do I want... (Looks at Chandler's menu)"
Chandler	 Please God don't let it be Kung Pow Chicken."
Mrs. Bing	 Oh, you watched the show! What'd you think?"
Chandler	 Well, I think you need to come out of your shell just a little.'
Ross	 (Entering) What is this dive? Only you could've picked this place."
Mrs. Bing	 Oooh, c'mon, shut up, it's fun. Gimme a hug. (They both sit down)\nWell, I think we're ready for some tequila."
Chandler	 I know I am.'
Mrs. Bing	 Who's doing shots?"
Monica	 Yeah.'
Phoebe	 I'm in."
Mrs. Bing	 There y'go. Ross?"
Ross	 Uh, I'm not really a shot drinking kinda guy."
Rachel	 Hi! Sorry- sorry we're late, we, uh, kinda just, y'know, lost track of\ntime."
Ross	 ...But a man can change. (Downs a shot)'
Ross	 Anyone want me to appraise anything?'
Rachel	 Mrs. Bing, I have to tell you, I've read everything you've ever written.\nNo, I mean it! I mean, when I read Euphoria at Midnight, all I wanted to do was become a\nwriter."
Mrs. Bing	 Oh, please, honey, listen, if I can do it, anybody can. You just\nstart with half a dozen European cities, throw in thirty euphemisms for male genitalia,\nand bam! You have got yourself a book.'
Chandler	 Myyy mother, ladies and gentlemen.'
Mrs. Bing	 Yeah, any messages for room 226?'
Mrs. Bing	 You okay there, slugger?'
Ross	 Yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine. (A woman emerges from the toilet behind him and\nhe tries to pretend he was in the other one)"
Mrs. Bing	 What is with you tonight?'
Ross	 Nothing. Nothing nothing nothing.'
Mrs. Bing	 (To phone) Okay, thank you. (To Ross) It's the Italian Hand-Licker,\nisn't it."
Ross	 No. It's the one he's licking."
Mrs. Bing	 She's supposed to be with you."
Ross	 You're good."
Mrs. Bing	 Oh, Ross, listen to me. I have sold a hundred million copies of my\nbooks, and y'know why?"
Ross	 The girl on the cover with her nipples showing?'
Mrs. Bing	 No. Because I know how to write men that women fall in love with.\nBelieve me, I cannot sell a Paolo. People will not turn three hundred twenty-five pages\nfor a Paolo. C'mon, the guy's a secondary character, a, y'know, complication you\neventually kill off."
Ross	 When?'
Mrs. Bing	 He's not a hero. ...You know who our hero is."
Ross	 The guy on the cover with his nipples showing?'
Mrs. Bing	 No, it's you!"
Ross	 Please.'
Mrs. Bing	 No, really, c'mon. You're smart, you're sexy..."
Ross	 Right.'
Mrs. Bing	 You are gonna be fine, believe me.'
Ross	 Uh-oh...'
Joey	 Uhhhh.... I'll just pee in the street."

Ross	 Hey, is Chandler here?'
Joey	 Yeah.'
Ross	 Okay, uh, about last night, um, Chandler.. you didn't tell... (Joey shakes\nhis head) Okay, 'cause I'm thinking- we don't need to tell Chandler, I mean, it was just a\nkiss, right? One kiss? No big deal? Right?"
Joey	 Right. No big deal.'
Ross	 Okay. '
Joey	 In Bizarro World!! You broke the code!'
Ross	 What code?'
Joey	 You don't kiss your friend's mom! Sisters are okay, maybe a hot-lookin'\naunt... but not a mom, never a mom!"
Chandler	 What are you guys doing out here?'
Ross	 Uh.. uh.. Well, Joey and I had discussed getting in an early morning\nracquetball game. But, um, apparently, somebody overslept.'
Joey	 Yeah, well, you don't have your racket."
Ross	 No, no I don't, because it's being restrung, somebody was supposed to\nbring me one."
Joey	 Yeah, well you didn't call and leave your grip size."
Chandler	 Okay, you guys spend waaaay too much time together. (Goes back inside\nand shuts the door)'
Ross	 Okay, I'm scum, I'm scum."
Joey	 Ross, how could you let this happen?'
Ross	 I don't know, God, I... well, it's not like she's a regular mom, y'know?\nShe's, she's sexy, she's..."
Joey	 You don't think my mom's sexy?"
Ross	 Well... not in the same way...'
Joey	 I'll have you know that Gloria Tribbiani was a handsome woman in her day,\nalright? You think it's easy giving birth to seven children?"
Ross	 Okay, I think we're getting into a weird area here..."
Rachel	 Hey.'
Ross	 Hey.'
Rachel	 What're you guys doing out here?"
Ross	 Well, not playing raquetball!'
Joey	 He forgot to leave his grip size!'
Ross	 He didn't get the goggles!"
Rachel	 Well,sounds like you two have issues.'
Rachel	 Goodbye, baby.'
Paolo	 Ciao, bela.'
Ross	 Do they wait for me to do this?'
Joey	 So are you gonna tell him?'
Ross	 Why would I tell him?'
Joey	 How about 'cause if you don't, his mother might."
Ross	 Oh...'
Monica	 (Entering) What are you guys doing here?'
Joey	 Uhhhh.... he's not even wearing a jockstrap!"
Monica	 ...What did I ask?'
Monica	 Hi.'
Phoebe	 Hi.'
Monica	 What are you doing here?'
Phoebe	 Nothing, I just thought I'd stop by.. y'know, after the uh... that I..\ny'know, so what are you doing here?"
Monica	 I'm not really here. Just thought I'd drop these off...on the way.. my\nway... Do you come here a lot? Without me?"
Phoebe	 No. (Monica brushes Coma Guy's hair in the other direction) No! No!\n...So, um, do you think he's doing any better than he was this morning?"
Monica	 How would I know? I-I wasn't here."
Phoebe	 Really? Not even to, um, change his PAJAMAS?! (Whips back the sheet to\nreveal him wearing new pajamas.)'
Chandler	 Oh my God. '
Ross	 You're my friend. I-I had to tell you."
Chandler	 I can't believe it. Paolo kissed my mom?"
Ross	 Yeah, um, I don't know if you noticed, but he had a lot to drink, and you\nknow how he gets when he's drun..uh... (He has caught sight of Joey scowling at him) I\ncan't do this, I did it, it was me, I'm sorry, I kissed your mom."
Chandler	 What?'
Ross	 I was really upset about Rachel and Paolo, and I think I had too much\ntequila, and Nora- um, Mrs. Mom- your Bing- was just being nice, y'know, and- But nothing\nhappened, nothing- Ask Joey, Joey, uh, came in-"
Chandler	 (To Joey) You knew about this?'
Joey	 Uh... y'know, knowledge is a tricky thing."
Chandler	 I spent the entire day with you, why didn't you tell me?!"
Joey	 Hey, hey, hey, you're lucky I caught them when I did, or else who knows\nwhat woulda happened."
Ross	 Thanks, man, big help.'
Chandler	 (To Ross) I can't believe this! What the hell were you thinking?"
Ross	 I wasn't- I mean, I-"
Chandler	 Y'know, of all my friends, no-one knows the crap I go through with my\nmom more than you. "
Ross	 I know-'
Chandler	 I can't believe you did this. (Walks toward the door)"
Ross	 Chandler-'
Joey	 Me neither, y'know what-"
Chandler	 I'm still mad at you for not telling me."
Joey	 What are you mad at me for?!'
Ross	 Chandler-'
Chandler	 You gotta let me slam the door! (Leaves; slams the door)'
Joey	 (Shouting after him) Chandler, I didn't kiss her, he did! (To Ross) See\nwhat happens when you break the code?"
Ross	 Joey-'
Joey	 Ah! (Points to door) Huh? (Leaves and slams the door)'
Monica	 Hey.'
Rachel	 Hey.'
Monica	 (Reading) 'A Woman Undone, by Rachel Karen Green'. "
Rachel	 Yeah. Thought I'd give it a shot. I'm still on the first chapter. Now,\ndo you think his 'love stick can be liberated from its denim prison'?"
Monica	 (Reads) Yeah, I'd say so. And there's no 'j' in 'engorged'."
Phoebe	 (Walks up with her guitar) Hey Rach.'
Rachel	 Hey.'
Phoebe	 Hello.'
Monica	 Hello. '
Phoebe	 Going to the hospital tonight?'
Monica	 No, you?'
Phoebe	 No, you?'
Monica	 You just asked me.'
Phoebe	 Okay, maybe it was a trick question. (Plays a few chords) Um, Rachel can\nwe do this now?'
Rachel	 Okay. (Writes a little more) I am so hot!'
Joey	 (To Ross, on the couch) Now, here's a picture of my mother and father on\ntheir wedding day. Now you tell me she's not a knockout."
Ross	 I cannot believe we're having this conversation."
Joey	 C'mon! Just try to picture her not pregnant, that's all."
Rachel	 (Into microphone) Central Perk is proud to present Miss Phoebe Buffay.'
Phoebe	 Thanks. Hi, um, 'kay. I'd like to start with a song that's about a man\nthat I recently met, who's, um, come to be very important to me. (Monica gives her a look)\n'Kay. (Sung
Rachel	 (Into mike) Okay, that was Phoebe Buffay, everybody. Woo!'
Chandler	 What was that?'
Ross	 Oh, uh, Phoebe just started a...'
Chandler	 Yeah, I believe I was talking to Joey, alright there, Mother-Kisser?\n(Goes to the counter)'
Joey	 (Laughing) Mother-Kisser... (Sees Ross's look) I'll shut up."
Ross	 Chandler, can I just say something? I-I know you're still mad at me, I\njust wanna say that there were two people there that night. Okay? Two sets of lips."
Chandler	 Yes, well, I expect this from her. Okay? She's always been a Freudian\nnightmare. "
Ross	 Okay, well, if she always behaves like this, why don't you say something?"
Chandler	 Because it's complicated, it's complex- Hey, you kissed my mom!"
Ross	 (To the rest of Central Perk) We're rehearsing a Greek play."
Chandler	 That's very funny. We done now?"
Ross	 No! Okay, you mean, you're not gonna talk to her, you're not gonna tell\nher how you feel?"
Chandler	 That would be no. Look, just because you played tonsil tennis with my\nmom doesn't mean you know her. Alright? Trust me, you can't talk to her."
Ross	 Okay, 'you' can't, or (Points to Chandler) you can't? (Chandler grabs his\nfinger) Okay, that's my finger. (Chandler twists it and Ross goes down on one knee)\nThat's, that's my knee. (To Central Perk) Still doing the play. Aaah!"
Phoebe	 Alright, whadyou do with him?'
Monica	 Oh! You're awake!"
Phoebe	 Look at you! How, how do you feel?'
Coma Guy	 Uh, a little woozy, but basically okay.'
Monica	 You look good!'
Coma Guy	 I feel good! ...Who are you?'
Monica	 Oh, sorry.'
Phoebe	 I'm Phoebe Buffay."
Monica	 I'm Monica Geller. I've been taking care of you."
Phoebe	 Well, we both have.'
Coma Guy	 So, the Etch-a-Sketch is from you guys?'
Phoebe	 Well, actually it's just from me."
Monica	 I got you the foot massager.'
Phoebe	 You know who shaved you? That was me.'
Monica	 I read to you.'
Phoebe	 I sang. (To Monica) Hah!'
Coma Guy	 Well,... thanks.'
Monica	 Oh, my pleasure.'
Phoebe	 You're welcome."
Coma Guy	 So. I guess I'll see you around."
Phoebe	 What, that's it? "
Monica	 "See you around?"'
Coma Guy	 Well, what do you want me to say?'
Monica	 Oh, I don\'t know. Maybe, um, "That was nice?" Admit something\nto me? "I\'ll call you?" '
Coma Guy	 Alright, I'll call you."
Phoebe	 I don't think you mean that."
Monica	 This is so typical. Y\'know, we give, and we give, and we give. And then-\nwe just get nothing back! And then one day, y\'know, it\'s just, you wake up, and "See\nyou around!" Let\'s go, Phoebe.'
Phoebe	 Y'know what? We thought you were different. But I guess it was just the\ncoma."
Mrs. Bing	 Car's waiting downstairs, I just wanted to drop off these copies of\nmy book for your friends. Anything you want from Lisbon?"
Chandler	 No, just knowing you're gonna be there is enough."
Mrs. Bing	 Alright, well, be good, I love you. (Kisses him and goes to leave)'
Chandler	 You kissed my best Ross! ...Or something to that effect.'
Mrs. Bing	 (Reentering) O-kay. Look, it, it was stupid.'
Chandler	 Really stupid.'
Mrs. Bing	 Really stupid. And I don't even know how it happened. I'm sorry,\nhoney, I promise it will never happen again. Are we okay now?"
Chandler	 Yeah. No. No...'
Ross	 Ah, the forbidden love of a man and his door.'
Joey	 Shh. He did it. He told her off, and not just about the kiss, about\neverything.'
Ross	 You're kidding."
Joey	 No, no. He said "When are you gonna grow up and start being a\nmom?"'
Ross	 Wow!'
Joey	 Then she came back with "The question is, when are you gonna grow up\nand realise I have a bomb?"'
Ross	 \'Kay, wait a minute, are you sure she didn\'t say "When are you gonna\ngrow up and realise I am your mom?"'
Joey	 That makes more sense.'
Ross	 So, what's going on now?"
Joey	 I dunno, I've been standing here spelling it out for you! (Goes back to\nthe door) I don't hear anything. Oh, wait, wait, wait. (Looks through the spyhole)"
Ross	 Whaddya see?'
Joey	 Hard to tell, they're so tiny and upside-down. Wait, wait. They're walking\naway... they're walking away... No, no they're not, they're coming right at us! Run! Run!"
Mrs. Bing	 You okay, kiddo?'
Chandler	 Yeah, okay.'
Mrs. Bing	 Alright. (Kisses him)'
Chandler	 Nice save.'
Ross	 (Very politely) Mrs. Bing.'
Mrs. Bing	 Mr. Geller.'
Chandler	 Hey.'
Ross	 You mean that?'
Chandler	 Yeah, why not. (They shake hands) So I told her.'
Ross	 Yeah? How'd it go?"
Chandler	 Awful. Awful. Couldn'ta gone worse. "
Ross	 Well, howdya feel?'
Chandler	 Pretty good! I told her.'
Ross	 Well, see? So, maybe it wasn't such a bad idea, y'know, me kissing your\nmom, uh? Huh? (Wags his finger at Chandler, then puts it down) But.. we don't have to go\ndown that road."

Rachel	 Okay. Now this is just the first chapter, and I want your absolute\nhonest opinion. Oh, oh, and on page two, he's not 'reaching for her heaving beasts'."
Monica	 What's a 'niffle'?"
Joey	 You usually find them on the 'heaving beasts'."
Rachel	 Alright, alright, so I'm not a great typist..."
Ross	 Wait, did you get to the part about his 'huge throbbing pens'? Tell ya,\nyou don't wanna be around when he starts writing with those!"
Rachel	 Alright, that's it! Give it back! That's it!"
All	 Nooo! '
