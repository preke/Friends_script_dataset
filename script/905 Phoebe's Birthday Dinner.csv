Phoebe	 Oh hey you guys, I couldn\xc2\x92t get a reservation for the night of \nmy birthday, so we have to do dinner Thursday night instead.'
Joey	 Thursday? But that\xc2\x92s Halloween.'
Phoebe	 So?'
Joey	 [It\xc2\x92s just] So spooky, that\xc2\x92s all.'
Ross	 So, so, is Mike coming to dinner?'
Phoebe	 No! It\xc2\x92s my first birthday with a boyfriend, and he has to \nwork. Uch, I get mad at him, but I think it\xc2\x92s a little to soon to show my true \ncolors.'
Rachel	 Pheebs, I would make a reservation for five, because one of us \nhas to stay home and watch Emma. (to Ross
Phoebe	 Oh, Rachel!'
Ross	 Actually, um, I was thinking maybe both of us could go.'
Phoebe	 Oh, yay!'
Ross	 Thanks, I put a lot of extra thoughts on your gift.'
Phoebe	 Alright, okay, so we can all go now. That is fun. Hey, you \nknow what? We all haven\xc2\x92t been together the six of us in such a long time.'
Monica	 What are you talking about? We\xc2\x92re all together right now.'
Rachel	 Um, Mon, Chandler\xc2\x92s not here.'
Monica	 Oh, dear god!'

Chandler	 Good morning everyone, it\xc2\x92s nice to see our team together \nfor the first time. Now, before we get started, are there any questions? \n(colleague raises hand) Yes, Ken is it?'
Ken	 That\xc2\x92s right. Is it true, that the reason you are here in Tulsa \nis that you fell asleep in a meeting and took the job without realizing what you \nwere saying yes to?'
Chandler	 (laughs) Well, don\xc2\x92t believe everything you hear, Ken. (both \nturning away to files) But yeah, that\xc2\x92s true. Alright, let\xc2\x92s get started, by \ntake a look at last quarter\xc2\x92s figures. (The female next to Chandler starts \nsmoking, towards her
Claudia	 I\xc2\x92m sorry. Does the smoke bother you?'
Chandler	 No, no, no-no-no. I smoked for years, then I quit. Right \nnow, I can\xc2\x92t remember why. (to everyone
Claudia	 Yes, in Oklahoma it\xc2\x92s legal to smoke in offices with fifteen \npeople or less. (passing the pack) Would you like one?'
Chandler	 Alright, lo\xc2\x85look. I don\xc2\x92t smoke anymore. But if the rest of \nyou want to light up, go ahead, it\xc2\x92s fine. (everyone lights up) So you all smoke \nthen? That\xc2\x92s almost rude, that I\xc2\x92m not.'
Ken	 That\xc2\x92s not true. If you don\xc2\x92t wanna smoke \xc2\x85'
Chandler	 (loud) Ken, please! No, I can\xc2\x92t, I can\xc2\x92t smoke. If I smoke, \nmy wife would kill me.'
Ken	 I\xc2\x92m sorry, but isn\xc2\x92t your wife back in New York?'
Chandler	 I always liked you, Ken. (takes a cigarette)'
Phoebe	 (from outside) Trick or treat! (It\xc2\x92s obviously Halloween eve, \nthe night of her birthday dinner.)'
Monica	 (opening the door) Hey!'
Phoebe	 Ooh, and treat it is. (Monica\xc2\x92s breasts.)'
Monica	 Hmhmm. (ties up)'
Phoebe	 Wow, so glad I changed. Almost wore my ??? outfit that can\xc2\x92t \ncontain my breasts.'
Monica	 This is not, what I\xc2\x92m wearing. I\xc2\x92m ovulating and Chandler\xc2\x92s \ngonna be home any minute, so I thought we would try before dinner.'
Phoebe	 Ohh. Oh wait! (Jis) you guys won\xc2\x92t be late for my dinner, will \nyou?'
Monica	 Believe me, Chandler and I have not seen each other in over a \nweek. We\xc2\x92ll probably be the first ones there.'
Phoebe	 \xc2\x92kay, see you there. Happy humping! (outside meeting \nChandler.) Hey\xc2\x85hey! Oh, wow, somebody smoked out here? Oh my god, don\xc2\x92t people \nknow, you\xc2\x92re not allowed to smoke in public spaces?'
Chandler	 Actually, in Oklahoma smoking is legal in all commune areas \nand offices with fewer than fifteen people.'
Phoebe	 You smoked!'
Chandler	 No! I just happened t\xc2\x92do a lot trivias about smoking in \ndifferent states. For example, in Hawaii cigarettes are called \nLeyhallalookoos.'
Phoebe	 (smells at him) Chandler, you stink of cigarettes.'
Chandler	 Uch, do you think, Monica is gonna be able smell it?'
Phoebe	 Are you kidding? The woman has the nose of a bloodhound \xc2\x85 and \nthe breasts of a Greek goddess.'
Chandler	 Pheebs?'
Phoebe	 (embarrassed) I\xc2\x92m gonna go. (leaves to stairs)'
Chandler	 (getting in) Okay, something to cover the smell \xc2\x85 Oven \ncleaner! (sprays himself, reads label) Unscented!'
Monica	 (naughty in doorway) Welcome home. I\xc2\x92ve missed you. join me in \nthe bedroom?'
Chandler	 No thanks, I\xc2\x92m good.'
Monica	 (comes over) O-kay, so you wanna play it that way, do you?'
Chandler	 (shrinks back) Right. You know what? Actually I just get off \nthe plane, so I\xc2\x92m feeling kinda gross. Maybe I should just take a shower.'
Monica	 You don\xc2\x92t need a shower.'
Chandler	 (still backs away) Alright, the truth is, I soiled myself \nduring some turbulences.'
Monica	 What do I smell? (sniffs him) I smell smoke. Huh\xc2\x97did you \nsmoke?'
Chandler	 Yes, but I just had one. Two. Two tiny cigarettes. Okay, \nfive. A pack. Two pack\xc2\x85a\xc2\x85a carton. Three big fat cartons in two days. (How many \ncigarettes are there in one pack and how many packs in one carton in the US?) \nBut it\xc2\x92s over, I made a decision, I\xc2\x92m not gonna smoke anymore.'
Monica	 (gets a pack out of his jacket)'
Chandler	 But, those are for you.'
Ross	 Alright, we\xc2\x92ll just, uh, see when you get here. Bye. (hangs up) \nHuh, that was my mom, she\xc2\x92s stuck in terrible traffic.'
Rachel	 Okay, well that\xc2\x92s now the third sign that I should not leave \nEmma.'
Ross	 Oh, what were the other two?'
Rachel	 Well, let\xc2\x92s see. The first one is

Rachel	 She is?'
Ross	 Ya.'
Rachel	 What about (?) Monica.'
Ross	 Hey, you only heard Monica\xc2\x92s side of that. That little fatso was \na terror.'
Rachel	 Ish. I just don\xc2\x92t think I can bear it.'
Ross	 Rachel, I know that you can. And you should.'
Rachel	 Uch.'
Ross	 Really, it would be good for you and in fact, why don\xc2\x92t you, why \ndon\xc2\x92t you go ahead to the restaurant and I will wait for my mom and then I\xc2\x92ll \nmeet you there.'
Rachel	 Oh-A.'
Ross	 No, no, really. You should go. Just go! Go! Go out! Really, the \nworld is your oyster. Kick up the heels. Paint the town red. (Slang right?)'
Rachel	 You need to learn some new slang.'
Ross	 I\xc2\x92m serious. C\xc2\x92mon, you should go. Here. (shoves her outside, \nwhile she tries to stay) No, uh-uh, just go.'
Rachel	 What \xc2\x85 Oh! (points inside)'

Phoebe	 Yes, they are expected presently. Yeah, yeah um, their arrival \nis in the offing.'
Waiter	 Right. We do have a table for two available, perhaps you would \nbe more comfortable.'
Joey	 No, they\xc2\x92re comin\xc2\x92, we\xc2\x92re waitin\xc2\x92 right here.'
Phoebe	 Joseph! (to waiter) Thou needn\xc2\x92t worry, they shan\xc2\x92t be \nlong.'
Waiter	 It\xc2\x92s just that we do have some large parties waiting.'

Chandler	 Oh, would you say this was the most upset you could be?'
Monica	 Yes.'
Chandler	 Then, I might as well \xc2\x85 (grabs the cigarettes) do this \n(lights one, exhales). Not really sure what to do now.'
Monica	 Well, I\xc2\x92ll tell you what we\xc2\x92re gonna do
Chandler	 Fine. What!?'
Monica	 Sex! This is the last day I\xc2\x92m ovulating, and when we don\xc2\x92t do \nit now, we\xc2\x92ll have to wait till next month. (walks towards bedroom)'

Ross	 I would, but I bruise like a peach. Besides, y\xc2\x85you know, \neverything is gonna be fine. The baby\xc2\x92s sleeping.'
Rachel	 What if she jumped out the bassinet?'
Ross	 Can\xc2\x92t hold her own head up, but yeah jumped.'
Rachel	 Oh my god, I left the water running.'
Ross	 Rach you did not leave the water running. Please, just pull \nyourself together, okay?'
Rachel	 Ah, did I leave the stove on?'
Ross	 You never cooked since 1996. (Actually Rachel cooked in \xc2\x93609 - \nTOW Ross Got High\xc2\x94, first aired 1999-11-25.)'
Rachel	 Is the window open? Because if there\xc2\x92s a window open, a bird \ncould fly in there.'
Ross	 Oh my god, you know what, yeah, I think you\xc2\x92re right. I think \xc2\x85 \nlisten, listen!'
Rachel	 Ubb.'
Ross	 A pigeon, a pigeon. (previously scared Rachel turns away) No, no \nwait, no-no, an eagle flew in. Landed on the stove and caught fire. The baby, \nseeing this, jumps across the apartment to the mighty bird\xc2\x92s aid. The eagle, \nhowever, misconstrues as an act of aggression and grabs the baby on its talon. \nMeanwhile the faucet fills the apartment with water. Baby and bird still up lays \n(?) are locked in a death grip, swirling around the whirl pool, that fills the \napartment.'
Rachel	 Boy, are you gonna be sorry if that\xc2\x92s true.'
Waiter	 Hello.'
Phoebe & Joey	 Hey.'
Waiter	 It\xc2\x92s been an hour. ??? be willing to reconsider switching to a \nsmaller table.'

Joey	 Wha-a how about this
Waiter	 Estrangement (?).'
Joey	 But it happens? (waiter leaves) I\xc2\x92m gotta go to the \nbathroom.'
Phoebe	 No, you can\xc2\x92t go. No-no-no, I can\xc2\x92t hold this table on my own. \nIf they ask me to move, I cave.'
Joey	 If you ask me to stay, I\xc2\x92ll pee. (leaves)'
Maitre D\xc2\x92	 Good evening, Miss. (Phoebe turns her head away) Miss? \n(from the opposite side) Miss? (she turns again) Miss!'

Monica	 Spend more time with the tie. That\xc2\x92ll make a baby.'
Chandler	 Look, I can\xc2\x92t do this. I can\xc2\x92t make luv to you while we\xc2\x92re \nfighting this way.'
Monica	 Oh sure, now you\xc2\x92re Mister Sensitivity. But when you wanted to \nhave sex right after my uncle\xc2\x92s funeral'
Chandler	 That was a celebration of life. Alright, look, I\xc2\x92m not gonna \ndo this. Alright, is this really the way you want a baby to be conceived?'
Monica	 No, you\xc2\x92re right. Mnya, we shouldn\xc2\x92t do it like this. Huch. \nFor what it\xc2\x92s worth, I\xc2\x92m, I\xc2\x92m sorry. I shouldn\xc2\x92t have come down on you so hard \nabout the smoking. So you had a few cigarettes, not the end of the world.'
Chandler	 Mean it?'
Monica	 Yah.'
Chandler	 You are incredible. Unless, I\xc2\x85I\xc2\x92m not gonna smoke again. And \nif I do, I promise, I will hide it so much better from you. (they kiss)'

Monica	 \xc2\x92kay.'
Rachel	 Och, god. (seeing Emma) Oh, thank god, you\xc2\x92re okay. I\xc2\x92m so \nsorry we left you. Mom never gonna leave you again. Never ever ever again. \nUch.'
Ross	 Great. So let\xc2\x92s get going?'
Rachel	 Oh no. I mean it. After what just happened, I\xc2\x92m never leaving \nher again.'
Ms. Geller	 I understand, separation is hard. One time I was about to \nleave Ross to go to the beauty parlor and he got so upset, he took off all his \nclothes, tucked his ??? between his legs and cried out
Ross	 Somehow over time it got easier to be apart from you.'
Chandler	 Uhh. You are welcome.'
Monica	 You know what? Let\xc2\x92s not talk.'
Chandler	 What?'
Monica	 Uch. I am still so mad at you for smoking.'
Chandler	 But you said you forgave me. It was just a couple of \ncigarettes\xc2\x97no big deal.'
Monica	 Oh, blablablabaybaybay.'
Chandler	 Leave it.'
Monica	 I was just saying that because I was ovulating and you said \nyou wouldn\xc2\x92t have sex with me while we\xc2\x92re fighting.'
Chandler	 You tricked me to get me into bed?'
Monica	 That\xc2\x92s right, I got mine.'
Chandler	 I feel so used.'
Phoebe	 Well, I guess they\xc2\x92re not coming. You wanna just order?'
Joey	 Thank you. (stands up and kisses her lips.) Waiter! \xc2\x92lright, \nthis is gonna be fast, so try to keep up
Waiter	 Er\xc2\x97does not.'
Phoebe	 Tomato tart and which of the pastas would you recommend?'
Waiter	 Oh, they\xc2\x92re both exclus\xc2\x85'
Phoebe	 Both it is, thank you.'
Joey	 Oh, uh, again. Can I make a special request
Ross & Rachel	 (entering) Hey, hi, hi!'
Waiter	 I\xc2\x92ll just wait to put your order in.'
Phoebe	 You guys are over an hour late. What happened to you two?'
Ross	 I\xc2\x92m so sorry \xc2\x85'
Rachel	 We got locked out of the apartment, we \xc2\x85'
Joey	 That\xc2\x92s a great story\xc2\x97can I eat it?'
Ross	 And then Rachel wasn\xc2\x92t sure she could leave the baby.'
Rachel	 N-it wasn\xc2\x92t easy, but it\xc2\x92s your birthday and I did what I got \nto do.'
Phoebe	 And that\xc2\x92s Judy over there at the bar with Emma?'
Rachel	 Oh honey, this is for the best, thus I\xc2\x92m not distracted, \nworrying about Emma, how she\xc2\x92s doing at home and I\xc2\x92m being completely here with \nyou and, oh, she spit up!'
Ross	 What?'
Rachel	 She spit up. Judy! She spi\xc2\x85Judy! Look alive, Judy! (they sit \ndown) Thank you.'
Ross	 Thanks. Oh.'
Rachel	 Oh, ooh, everything looks delicious. What should I ha-ave? \nWhat should I have?'
Joey	 (mumbling) Never hit a woman. Never hit a woman.'
Ross	 Y\xc2\x92know this ??? is incredible.'
Joey	 Ross bruises like a peach. He bruises like a peach.'
Ross	 Okay, I\xc2\x92ll have the fixed salad and the duck.'
Rachel	 Yah, I\xc2\x92ll have the soup and the salmon.'
Joey	 And remember whatever comes up first. Okay? And hurry, because \n\xc2\x85'
Monica	 (entering with husband) Happy birthday!'
Joey	 Son of a bitch!'
Phoebe	 Wher-where have you been?'
Monica	 Well, we had a little fight.'
Chandler	 I would never lie to get someone into bed.'
Monica	 You used to tell girls you were a Kennedy. (being sat down) \nOoh, uh, thanks. Wow, little tight, isn\xc2\x92t it? How d\xc2\x92you get a bigger table? \nYou-you had a big table, but they made you move. Huh-huh, shut up Monica. Whoo, \nI suppose that Chandler will have the smoked duck.'
Chandler	 I suppose that Monica will have the \xc2\x85 manipulative \nshrew.'
Waiter	 I\xc2\x92ll give you another minute.'
Joey	 Why are you going? He said, she wanted the shrew! (runs after \nthe waiter)'
Ross	 Rach, c\xc2\x92mon, Emma is fine. You\xc2\x92re turning into an obsessive \nmother. Okay, you need to stop.'
Rachel	 Y\xc2\x92guys ever heard the story about when Rosses mom went to the \nbeauty salon?'
Chandler	 You mean the lully story?'
Ross	 (childish) Huh-huh, they already know it.'
Phoebe	 You guys, we\xc2\x92ve been waiting for you for a long time, maybe \nyou should order.'
Joey	 (returned) No, no, it\xc2\x92s okay, I already told the waiter what \nthey want.'
Monica	 Why would you do that?'
Joey	 Chandler, control your woman!'
Rachel	 (lifts for a toast) Okay, as everybody has ordered, I would \nlike to start the celebration and make a toast \xc2\x85 to Phoebe. She dropped her \nsock.'
Phoebe	 Aw \xc2\x85 what?'
Rachel	 N-no, Emma dropped her sock.'
Monica	 Mom\xc2\x92s here? I wanted to have lunch with her today, she told me \nshe was out of town.'
Rachel	 Ross, she still has not noticed that the baby\xc2\x92s sock is on the \nground.'
Phoebe	 \xc2\x92s a good toast.'
Rachel	 (to Ross) Could you please get her attention?'
Ross	 W-oa \xc2\x85 Mommy! (gestures to his not understanding mother)'
Phoebe	 (getting up) Oh, for god\xc2\x92s sake, Judy, pick up the sock! Pick \nup the sock! Pick up the sock! (everybody scared) I\xc2\x92m sorry, was that rude? \nDi-did my, my li-little outburst blunt (?) the hideousness (?) that is this \nevening? Look, I know, you all have a lot going on, but all I wanted to do was \nhave dinner with my friends on my birthday. And you are all so late and you \ndidn\xc2\x92t even have the courtesy to call. (her cellular rings) Well, it\xc2\x92s too late \nnow.'
Ross	 Well, ??? think that\xc2\x92s us?'

Joey	 (to Chandler and Monica) Well, what is going on with you \ntwo?'
Monica	 Uch, you see, I\xc2\x92m ovulating.'
Chandler	 Oh yeah, that\xc2\x92s what she says. But maybe you\xc2\x92re not \novulating at all, maybe it\xc2\x92s just a clever ruse to get me into bed.'
Monica	 Yes smokie, that is what it was. I just can\xc2\x92t get enough.'
Chandler	 (to Joey) You not gonna believe this
Joey	 So? Did have sex, right?'
Chandler	 What\xc2\x92s the matter with me? Why I\xc2\x92m such a girl?'
Phoebe	 (returns) Okay, that was Mike.'
Rachel	 Phoebe, hi, we\xc2\x92re so sorry. You\xc2\x92re totally right. We are here \none hundred per cent and we love you and we are ready to start your birthday \ncelebration.'
Phoebe	 Mhuh, guys, that means the world to me. Huh, nkay, I\xc2\x92m gonna \ntake off.'
Rachel	 What?'
Phoebe	 Oh, I love you guys too, but Mike got off work early. Wait. \nWait, I\xc2\x92m not t\xc2\x97not that kind of girl that just ditches her friends to be with \nher boyfriend. You know what? I am. Bye guys! (waves to the bar) Judy! Bye.'
Rachel	 Oh thank god, if Phoebe\xc2\x92s going, can we please take Emma \nhome?'
Ross	 You know, I think that\xc2\x92s a good idea\xc2\x97our babysitter just pounded \nin another Chardonnet. (both get up) Bye, y\xc2\x92guys.'
Monica	 Bye.'
Joey	 See ya. Well, this is just us.'
Monica & Chandler	 Mhum.'
Monica	 So, I\xc2\x92m, I\xc2\x92m probably still ovulating. Do you want to give it \nanother try?'
Chandler	 So you never had sex with a Kennedy, have you?'
Joey	 Do, do you gonna do it now?'
Monica	 We don\xc2\x92t have much time. Once the egg descended the oviduct \n\xc2\x85'
