Chandler	 (watches Joey for a moment) Okay! (Joey quickly moves the hockey stick\nso that he\xc2\x92s scratching his back with it.) Listen, I\xc2\x92m gonna be moving out so you\nwill be in charge of paying the rent.'
Joey	 Right! And when is that due?'
Chandler	 First of the month.'
Joey	 And that\xc2\x92s every month?'
Chandler	 No, just the months you actually want to live here.'
Joey	 Ahhh.'
Chandler	 Okay, here is the phone bill. (Hands it to Joey.)'
Joey	 (looking at it) Oh my God!!'
Chandler	 That\xc2\x92s our phone number. Now look, I know I kinda sprung this\nwhole me moving out on thing, so why don\xc2\x92t I just\xc2\x97why don\xc2\x92t I just cover\nyou for a while?'
Joey	 No-no! No way! Joey Tribbiani does not take charity\xc2\x85anymore.'
Chandler	 It\xc2\x92s not charity, Joe\xc2\x85'
Joey	 No! Forget it! Okay\xc2\x97I mean thanks, but I\xc2\x92m done taking money\nfrom you. All right, I can take of myself. Now, what\xc2\x92s next? Come on.'
Chandler	 Okay uh, here\xc2\x92s the electric bill. (Hands it to him.)'
Joey	 This is how much we pay for electric?!!!'
Chandler	 Uh, yeah.'
Chandler	 So, we\xc2\x92ll do the rest of the bills later then?'

Phoebe	 So is Joey going to have to give up the apartment?'
Chandler	 No, I hope not! I tried to offer him some money, but he wouldn\xc2\x92t\ntake it.'
Phoebe	 Well, how much do you think he needs?'
Chandler	 I figure that $1,500 would cover him for a few months, y\xc2\x92know?\nBut I have to trick him into taking it so I won\xc2\x92t hurt his pride.'
Phoebe	 Why don\xc2\x92t you hire him as an actor? You could have him dress up and\nput on little skits. Whatever you want.'
Chandler	 Well that would help the pride thing.'
Monica	 (entering from her room) Hey!'
Chandler	 Hey! Wow! You look great! Wanna move in with me tomorrow?'
Monica	 (thinks) Okay.'
Chandler	 Okay! (They kiss) So, what do you girls have planned for tonight?'
Monica	 Well, instead of being sad that tonight is my last night together with\nRachel we thought we\xc2\x92d go out to dinner and celebrate the fact that Rachel is moving\nin with Phoebe.'
Phoebe	 And also, my birthday.'
Monica	 It\xc2\x92s not your birthday.'
Phoebe	 What a mean thing to say! I would never tell you it\xc2\x92s not\nyour birthday!'
Joey	 Hey!'
Ross	 Hey!'
Chandler	 Hey!'
Phoebe	 Hey! So you guys have anything planned for the big last night?'
Chandler	 Well, instead of just hanging out, we figure we\xc2\x92d do nothing.'
Ross	 Whoa-whoa-whoa, Knicks season opener tonight. I thought maybe you guys\nwould come over and watch it.'
Joey	 I don\xc2\x92t know Ross, not if you\xc2\x92re gonna talk about how you gave\nup a career in basketball to become a paleontologist.'
Ross	 I did give up a career in basketball to become a paleontologist!'
Rachel	 (entering from her room) Pheebs, I was wondering\xc2\x85'
Monica	 You\xc2\x92re not dressed yet?! We\xc2\x92re supposed to start having fun in\n15 minutes!'
Rachel	 Well and clearly not a minute sooner.'
Monica	 Rachel, you are packed though right, I mean please tell me that\nyou\xc2\x92re packed. '
Rachel	 Of course I packed! Monica relax! I just wanted to ask Phoebe her\nopinion on what I should wear tonight.'
Phoebe	 My God, I can\xc2\x92t get a minute of peace around this place.'

Phoebe	 Oh my God! Monica\xc2\x92s just gonna kill you.'
Rachel	 Yeah, yeah, I know.'
Phoebe	 Well, what you\xc2\x92re wearing is fine for that.'
Monica	 (entering) Rachel, I need to borrow\xc2\x97You\xc2\x92re not packed!!!!\nYou\xc2\x92re not packed even a little bit!'
Rachel	 Surprise!!'
Monica	 What?'
Rachel	 No, no don\xc2\x92t get mad because look\xc2\x97this is what happened. So\nI-I started packing, then I realized, "What am I doing? I am lousy at packing!"\nRight? But you love packing! So, as a gift to you, on our last night, ta-da!\n'
Monica	 (grabs a bag of those Styrofoam peanuts) I\xc2\x92ll be coordinator! Oh my\nGod! I\xc2\x92m so sorry, I didn\xc2\x92t get you anything! Okay, look everybody has to help!\nOkay? You can help, can\xc2\x92t you Phoebe?'
Phoebe	 I have plans.'
Monica	 You\xc2\x92re plans were with us.'
Phoebe	 That\xc2\x92s right.'
Monica	 All right, Chandler can make boxes, Ross can wrap, and Joey can lift\nthings. Now Phoebe, go tell the guys they have to help out!'
Phoebe	 Okay.'
Monica	 Okay! (To Rachel) Oh my God, thank you!!'
Phoebe	 Hurry! Monica\xc2\x92s gonna make you pack! She\xc2\x92s got jobs for\neveryone! Now, it\xc2\x92s too late for me, but save your selves! (The guys scramble for the\ndoor.)'
Monica	 (entering and interrupting the guy\xc2\x92s escape attempt) Okay! The\nmovers will be here in 11 hours. Rachel has not packed. Now, everybody has to help!\nChandler, we\xc2\x92re gonna start with\xc2\x85'
Chandler	 Oh nope, I-I have plans with Joey.'
Monica	 I thought you said you were going to do nothing.'
Chandler	 Yes, but for the last time.'
Monica	 Okay fine, now Ross\xc2\x85'
Ross	 Oh, but-but I can\xc2\x92t do it.'
Monica	 Why not?'
Joey	 (quietly) I\xc2\x92ve got Ben.'
Ross	 Because, because I\xc2\x92ve got Ben.'
Monica	 It\xc2\x92s almost 8 o\xc2\x92clock, it\xc2\x92s almost past his bedtime.\nWhere-where is he?'
Chandler	 He\xc2\x92s at a dinner party.'
Monica	 Is he really coming? Because I can see right into your apartment!'
Ross	 Of course he is! What, do you think I\xc2\x92d just use my son as-as an\nexcuse? What kind of father do you think I am?'
Monica	 All right, sorry. (Goes back to Rachel\xc2\x92s room.)'
Ross	 (to the guys) I gotta go make a fake Ben.'
Joey	 Here it is! Our last pizzas together as roommates.'
Chandler	 Oh, I wish I\xc2\x92d know you were going to do that, I ordered Chinese.'
Joey	 Oh that\xc2\x92s okay. Hey, actually in a way it\xc2\x92s kinda nice. Me,\nbringing the food of my ancestors, you, the food of yours!'
Chandler	 Say, Joe, I had a strange idea of what we could do for our last night.\nWhat do you say we play a little uh, foosball for money?'
Joey	 What, are you crazy? You haven\xc2\x92t beaten me once since my injury\nplagued \xc2\x9297 season. It would be easier if you just give me your money.'
Chandler	 Yes it would. What do you say to $50?'
Joey	 Okay, you\xc2\x92re on.'
Chandler	 Okay, let\xc2\x92s play! The big game, Italy vs. China, apparently.'
Rachel	 Ohhhhhh, look it\xc2\x92s the roller blades.'
Monica	 (starting to cry) Oh God!'
Rachel	 You remember when we got these?'
Monica	 No.'
Rachel	 I guess you weren\xc2\x92t there. (They hug.)'
Phoebe	 You guys, we said we were gonna have fun! Come on, hey, remember the\ntime\xc2\x85 (She starts laughing hysterically.) You don\xc2\x92t remember?'
Rachel	 I\xc2\x92m sorry Pheebs, I guess I\xc2\x92m just really said that I\xc2\x92m\nleaving.'
Monica	 I\xc2\x92m gonna miss you so much.'
Phoebe	 Well, this doesn\xc2\x92t have to be so sad though. Y\xc2\x92know? Maybe\ninstead of just thinking about how much you\xc2\x92re gonna miss each other, you should like\nthink of the things you\xc2\x92re not gonna miss.'
Monica	 I don\xc2\x92t think there\xc2\x92s anything.'
Phoebe	 Come on, there\xc2\x92s gotta be something.'
Monica	 Nope, she\xc2\x92s perfect.'
Rachel	 I have one.'
Phoebe	 Good! Great! You can go first.'
Rachel	 Uh well, I guess I\xc2\x92m not gonna miss the fact that you\xc2\x92re never\nallowed to move the phone pen. (Laughs. Monica lags behind the laugh a little bit.)'
Phoebe	 Good that\xc2\x92s a good one. Okay, Monica, anything? Y\xc2\x92know? Does\nRachel move the phone pen?'
Monica	 Aw, sometimes. Always, actually.'
Phoebe	 Okay, good. There you go. Doesn\xc2\x92t anyone feel better?'
Monica	 Not just the phone pen. I never get my messages.'
Rachel	 You get your messages!'
Monica	 Yeah, well I don\xc2\x92t think it really counts if you have to read them\noff the back of your hand after you fall asleep on the couch.'
Rachel	 So-so, you missed a message from who? Chandler or your mom? Or Chandler?\nOr your mom?'
Phoebe	 Great! It worked! No one\xc2\x92s sad.'
Joey	 (scores) Yes! I win again! Ha-ha! That\xc2\x92s like 500 bucks you owe me!\nWhoo-ho-hoo! (Goes over to the fridge and starts opening and closing the door rapidly.)\n$500 that is a loooot of electricity! (By the way, there\xc2\x92s nothing in the fridge.)\nWhoo-ho-ho! (Notices the sparseness of the fridge.) I gotta buy some food.'
Chandler	 Okay, give me a chance to win my money back. Okay? Sudden death, one\ngoal, $1,000.'
Joey	 You serious?'
Chandler	 Oh yes!'
Joey	 Okay, get ready to owe me!'
Chandler	 Okay.'
Joey	 Okay, here we go. Ready?'
Chandler	 No! No! No! No\xc2\x97(Joey looks at him)\xc2\x97one can beat me.'
Chandler	 See? Now, that\xc2\x92s why only the little fake men are supposed to do\nall the kicking.'
Monica	 Hello? (Listens) Oh, hi Ross! (To Rachel) See? Other people call me!'
Rachel	 Ooh, your brother. Score!'
Monica	 (on phone) What\xc2\x92s up?'
Ross	 Oh, I\xc2\x92m just over here with Ben. I thought we\xc2\x92d say hi.'
Monica	 Oh, put him on!'
Ross	 Ben, say hi to Aunt Monica. (He holds the phone to the fake Ben he has\ncreated out of a pumpkin.) Oh, I guess he doesn\xc2\x92t feel like talking right now.\nHe\xc2\x92s smiling though! Okay, talk to you later.'
Phoebe	 Yeah, I think it was better when you guys were sad. Hey, uh, remember\nthe roller blades?'
Rachel	 You know what else I\xc2\x92m not gonna miss? "I\xc2\x92m Monica. I\nwash the toilet 17 times a day. Even if people are on it!"'
Monica	 "Hi I\xc2\x92m Rachel, is my sweater too tight? No? Oh, I\xc2\x92d\nbetter wash it and shrink it!"'
Rachel	 "I\xc2\x92m Monica, I don\xc2\x92t get phone messages from interesting\npeople. Ever!"'
Phoebe	 Hey! I call her!'
Monica	 "Oh my God, I love Ross! I hate Ross! I love Ross! I hate\nRoss!"'
Rachel	 "Oh my God, I can\xc2\x92t find a boyfriend! So I guess I\xc2\x92ll\njust stumble across the hall and sleep with the first guy I find in there!"'
Phoebe	 Yeah, we should get a move on if we wanna make those dinner\nreservations. (Phoebe dumps a drawer full of makeup into a box.)'

Chandler	 Still broken?'
Joey	 This sucks man! The last night you\xc2\x92re here and I lose the two most\nimportant things in my life, the foosball table and $500.'
Chandler	 Well, there are other ways of winning back your money, how about a\nlittle uh, a little Blackjack? (Holds up a deck of cards.)'
Joey	 Nah, not my game.'
Chandler	 Okay, uh, how about, how about\xc2\x97y\xc2\x92know what? We could play a\nnew game. A new game, it\xc2\x92s fun.'
Joey	 Well, what\xc2\x92s it called?'
Chandler	 Cups.'
Joey	 I don\xc2\x92t know how to play Cups.'
Chandler	 I\xc2\x92ll teach ya! Come on, come on, it\xc2\x92s really easy and\nreally, really fun.'
Joey	 All right.'
Chandler	 Okay, here you go. (He deals out two cards each.) I have two queens,\nwhat do you have?'
Joey	 A two and a five.'
Chandler	 Ho-ho, you win! 50 dollars!'
Joey	 Really?!'
Chandler	 Oh yeah! Okay, let\xc2\x92s play again. (He deals out two cards each\nagain.) What do you got?'
Joey	 A four and a nine.'
Chandler	 You\xc2\x92re kidding right?'
Joey	 No. Why?'
Chandler	 Well that\xc2\x92s a full cup! (Pays him again.)'
Joey	 Damn! I am good at Cups!'
Monica	 I\xc2\x92m not talking to her!'
Phoebe	 Well, one of you has to take the first step! And it should be you,\nbecause she\xc2\x92s the one who\xc2\x92s leaving. It\xc2\x92s harder for her!'
Monica	 Well, maybe you\xc2\x92re right\xc2\x97She made fun of my phone pen!'
Phoebe	 I know, I took it hard too.'
Monica	 Listen Rachel, I feel really bad about\xc2\x97What are you doing? (She\nsees that Rachel is unpacking.)'
Rachel	 I\xc2\x92m unpacking!'
Monica	 What?!'
Rachel	 I\xc2\x92m not moving! (She re-hangs a picture, crookedly.) Is that\npicture straight?'
Monica	 It needs to go about 20 blocks to the left!'
Rachel	 Hey, y\xc2\x92know what? You\xc2\x92re the one who wants to make this big\nchange and move in with Chandler! You should be the one to go! Why should I have to\nleave?!'
Monica	 Because it\xc2\x92s my apartment!'
Rachel	 Well it\xc2\x92s mine too! What else you got?!'
Monica	 How about, you\xc2\x92re moving!! (Grabs a bunch of clothes and throws\nthem into a box. What follows is a brief sequence of Rachel unpacking and Monica packing\nthe same stuff over and over again as Rachel chants "No." and Monica chants\n"Yes.")'
Rachel	 Look! This is ridiculous. We should be packing you!! (She knocks over\nMonica, grabs a box, and runs into the kitchen.)'
Phoebe	 Hey, how are you guys doing?'
Rachel	 Great! Monica\xc2\x92s moving!'
Monica	 (entering) I am not!'
Rachel	 Oh really?! Then how come all your stuff is in this box?! (Monica starts\nchasing Rachel around the table.)'
Phoebe	 Okay, you guys. You guys I think I know what\xc2\x92s going on here. Okay,\nyou guys\xc2\x85 STOP!! (They stop.) I know that, I know that you\xc2\x92re\nacting mad because you think that it\xc2\x92ll make it easier to leave. But deep down\nyou\xc2\x92re still really sad. Deep-deep down.'
Monica	 No Phoebe I am mad!'
Phoebe	 Well, deep-deep-deep down!'
Rachel	 Yeah, I\xc2\x92m just mad!'
Phoebe	 Then keep running. (They resume the chase.)'
Chandler	 You win.'
Joey	 Well, what did you have?'
Chandler	 It doesn\xc2\x92t matter because nothing beats a three and a six. That\nmy friend is D-Cup. Okay, now much have you won so far?'
Joey	 Uh, (counts the money) wow, 700.'
Chandler	 Not 700 exactly?'
Joey	 Yeah.'
Chandler	 Double it! (He does.)'
Joey	 What?'
Chandler	 Well you see in Cups, once you get $700, you have to double it.'
Joey	 Really?'
Chandler	 Hey, I didn\xc2\x92t make up the rules. Now, after you receive the\ndoubling bonus, you get uh, one card. Now that one card could be worth $100 bringing your\ntotal to 1,500. (Joey gets excited.) Don\xc2\x92t get to excited because that\xc2\x92s not\ngonna happen unless you get\xc2\x97No way! (He takes the top card, which is the two of\nclubs. Of course, any card would\xc2\x92ve won. Chandler pays him.)'
Monica	 Well, this is the last box of your clothes. I\xc2\x92m just gonna label\nit, "What were you thinking?"'
Rachel	 Funny, because I was just gonna go across the hall and write that on\nChandler.'
Phoebe	 Hey you guys, I don\xc2\x92t mean to make things worse, but umm, I\ndon\xc2\x92t want to live with Rachel anymore.'
Monica and Rachel	 What?!'
Phoebe	 You\xc2\x92re just so mean to each other! And I don\xc2\x92t want to end up\nlike that with Rachel. I still like you!'
Rachel	 Well, Phoebe that\xc2\x92s fine because I\xc2\x92m not moving.'
Monica	 Whoa-whoa-whoa, Phoebe you gotta take her! Y\xc2\x92know I-I-I said some\nreally bad stuff about her, but y\xc2\x92know Rachel has some good qualities that\nmake her a good roommate.'
Rachel	 Oh really? Like what Monica?'
Monica	 Y\xc2\x92know she has 147,000 pairs of boots\xc2\x85'
Rachel	 Oh yeah, good start Mon.'
Monica	 She lets you borrow them.'
Rachel	 Yeah and you stretch \xc2\x91em out with your big old clown feet.'
Monica	 Do you wanna live outside?! Because it\xc2\x92s gettin\xc2\x92 cold! (To\nPhoebe) She gets tons of catalogs and umm, she\xc2\x92ll fold down the pages of the things\nshe thinks that I\xc2\x92d like.'
Phoebe	 What else?'
Monica	 When I take a shower, she leaves me little notes on the mirror.'
Rachel	 Yeah, I do. I-I do, do that.'
Phoebe	 That\xc2\x92s nice. I like having things to read in the bathroom.'
Monica	 When I fall asleep on the couch after reading, she covers me over with a\nblanket.'
Rachel	 Well y\xc2\x92know, I don\xc2\x92t want you to be cold.'
Monica	 And when I told her that I was gonna be moving in with Chandler, she was\nreally supportive. (To Rachel) (Starts to cry) You were so great. You made it so easy. And\nnow you have to leave. And I have to live with a boy!! (They both break down in tears.)'
Rachel	 Oh, it\xc2\x92s gonna be fine.'
Phoebe	 Okay Rachel, I can\xc2\x92t wait to live with you! And you know\nwhat we should do? Bring Monica and then we could all live there together! We\xc2\x92ll have\nso much fun!!'
Rachel	 But honey, I think she\xc2\x92s moving in with Chandler.'
Phoebe	 Oh that\xc2\x92s right. You\xc2\x92re still set on that?'
Monica	 Kinda. (She hugs Phoebe and looks out the window. She moves closer to it\nto get a better look.) Oh my God!'
Ross	 (answering the phone) Hello? (Listens) Hey Mon, how\xc2\x92s the packing\ngoing? (Listens) Ben? He\xc2\x92s fine. Yeah, he\xc2\x92s right\xc2\x97Oh my God! (He looks over\nat the fake Ben and notices that the head has fallen off.) Get your head of your shirt\nthere son! (He tries to push the pumpkin through the neck hole.) What? (Listens) Yeah,\nit\xc2\x92s a pumpkin. I\xc2\x92ll come pack.'
Joey	 Hey!'
Chandler	 What\xc2\x92s wrong?'
Joey	 Ross and I were helping the girls pack, took a little break, I lost $1,500\nto him in Cups!'
Chandler	 Wh-How did you lose at Cups?!'
Joey	 The same way you lost. I started out with a King and a Queen, bamn! Ross\ngets a 2 and a 3. Then I get a Jack and a King, boom! Ross gets a 4 and a 5! Ross was\ngetting the Cup card, the D-Cup, the Sittin\xc2\x92 Down Bonus! Meanwhile, I didn\xc2\x92t\neven get half a cup! Nothin\xc2\x92!!'
Chandler	 Oh man!!'
Joey	 And he never played before either! Y\xc2\x92know what I think? I think\nbeginner\xc2\x92s luck, very important in Cups.'
Chandler	 All right, let\xc2\x92s play one more hand! One more!'
Joey	 No, no, no more! I cannot lose another dime! I\xc2\x92m serious this time!\nIn-in fact, look, there\xc2\x92s a\xc2\x97I wanna give you something. And let me give it too\nyou know before I pawn it for Cups money. (He rolls the big white dog over) Now, I want\nyou to have the big white dog as a kinda of a, y\xc2\x92know, thank you for being such a\ngreat roommate.'
Chandler	 I can\xc2\x92t take the big white dog! You love it!'
Joey	 It\xc2\x92s him, not it!'
Chandler	 No, but wait\xc2\x97what if I bought it from you, y\xc2\x92know? And your\nnice gesture would be giving it to me at a reasonable price, say (Gets choked up) $1,500?'
Joey	 Wait a second, I see what you\xc2\x92re trying to do here! You-you\xc2\x92re\ntrying to give me money again!'
Chandler	 When did I try to give you money?'
Joey	 Over there! (Points to the couch) Before, with the bills! You tried to\ngive some charity, I said "No," you dropped it. Okay? Then we had a nice last\nnight together, we had some fun, we gambled, nobody tried to give anybody any money! Now\nout of the blue, you start with the charity thing again!'
Chandler	 I\xc2\x92m just trying to help you out! Okay? I wanna make sure that\nyou\xc2\x92re okay.'
Joey	 I will be okay! Look Chandler, you gotta get it out of your head\nthat I can\xc2\x92t take care of myself. Okay? Look, I\xc2\x92m not gonna miss you helping me\nout with money. The only thing that I\xc2\x92m gonna miss\xc2\x85is you. And now the dog.'
Monica	 Hey. Call me when you get there. Okay?'
Rachel	 Okay.'
Monica	 I\xc2\x92m really gonna miss you.'
Rachel	 Oh! I have your key. Here you go. (Hands it to Monica.)'
Monica	 Thanks.'
Rachel	 Yeah.'
Rachel	 Oh God! This is silly, I\xc2\x92m gonna see you in a couple of hours!\n(They hug again.) '
Monica	 Yeah.'
Rachel	 Bye house!'
Rachel	 Bye Mon.'
Monica	 Bye.'
Chandler	 (entering) Hey.'
Monica	 She really left.'
Chandler	 I know. (He kisses her.)'
Monica	 Thank you.'
Chandler	 No problem roomie. (She turns around and hugs him.)'
Monica	 Can I ask you a question?'
Chandler	 Sure!'
Monica	 What the hell is that dog doing here?! (She notices the dog\nsitting in the living room.)'

Chandler	 I invented the game of Cups as a way to give Joey money.'
Ross	 And now you want that money back.'
Chandler	 Exactly.'
Ross	 Chandler, what kind of an idiot do you take me for? (As he picks up the\nfake Ben.)'
Chandler	 It\xc2\x92s not a real game! I made it up!'
Ross	 I\xc2\x92m sorry you lost your money, but I won it fair and square.'
Chandler	 At a fake game!!'
Ross	 Now, if you wanna try to make some of it back, I\xc2\x92d be glad to play\nyou for it. But I should warn you, I am very good at Cups.'
Chandler	 Okay! Now I assume the Saucer card came up when you played last.'
Ross	 No.'
Chandler	 Hmm, let\xc2\x92s see if it comes up this time. (He looks at his cards\nand shrugs.)'
