Chandler	 Hey.'
Monica	 What\xc2\x92s the matter?'
Chandler	 Someone on the subway licked my neck! Licked my neck!!'
Phoebe	 Oh Willie\xc2\x92s still alive!'
Chandler	 What are you guys doing?'
Monica	 Oh, my mom called, they\xc2\x92re gonna run our engagement announcement in\nthe local paper, so we\xc2\x92re looking for a good picture of us.'
Chandler	 Oooh, I\xc2\x92m afraid that does not exist.'
Monica	 That\xc2\x92s not true, there are great pictures of us!'
Chandler	 No, there are great pictures of you standing next to a guy who\xc2\x92s\ngoing like this\xc2\x85 (Makes what can only be described as a toothy frown. Henceforth,\nthis shall be known as The Face.)'
Phoebe	 Oh my God! That\xc2\x92s the creep that you\xc2\x92re with at the Statue\nof Liberty.'
Chandler	 I don\xc2\x92t know what it is, I just can\xc2\x92t take a good picture.'
Monica	 (looking at one) Oh, here\xc2\x92s a great one.'
Chandler	 Yeah, I\xc2\x92m not in that.'
Monica	 I know, but look at me all tan.'
Phoebe	 Hey, why don\xc2\x92t you guys go, get portraits done by a professional\nphotographer.'
Monica	 That\xc2\x92s a good idea! I bet they have one of those wind machines!\nY\xc2\x92know\xc2\x85 (Does the whole hair blowing in the wind model type poses.)'
Phoebe	 Yeah that\xc2\x92s great! Next to that, Chandler won\xc2\x92t look so\nstupid.'
Monica	 Chandler what do you say?'
Chandler	 All right, but I should warn you, I\xc2\x92m not going. I\xc2\x92m going.\n(Does The Face while saying that last part.)'

Ross	 (To Chandler) Dude, that reverse lay-up! Oh\xc2\x85'
Chandler	 How about those three pointers?'
Ross	 Amazing!'
Chandler	 And those guys were this (Doing the standard "This\nClose" gesture) close to lettin\xc2\x92 us play this time too.'
Rachel	 Hey look-look, Phoebe\xc2\x92s talking to uh, Cute Coffeehouse Guy.'
Ross	 Oh, you guys call him Cute Coffeehouse Guy, we call him Hums While He\nPees.'
Chandler	 Yes, and we call Ross Lingers In The Bathroom.'
Phoebe	 (returning) Hey you guys, Hums While He Pees just asked me out!'
Rachel	 Hey, I thought that guy was married.'
Phoebe	 He is! But he\xc2\x92s getting divorced\xc2\x97Ross! Maybe you know him.'
Ross	 It\xc2\x92s not a club.'
Rachel	 Phoebe, if this guy\xc2\x92s going through a divorce, is it such a good\nidea to start going out with him?'
Ross	 Hey, divorced men are not bad men!'
Chandler	 They have that on the napkins at the club.'
Rachel	 Oh, I gotta get back to work.'
Phoebe	 You don\xc2\x92t have to be back for a half-hour!'
Rachel	 Yeah but, my assistant Tag does sit-ups in the office during lunch. Ohh!\nI could just spread him on a cracker.'
Chandler	 Rach, if you have a crush on this guy, why would you hire him? I mean\ny\xc2\x92know you can\xc2\x92t date him right?'
Rachel	 Oh no, I know that. I know that. Although, we made a joke that we spend\nso much time together he should call me his work wife.'
Ross	 Soon he\xc2\x92ll be able to call you, that lady he knew who got fired.'
Rachel	 I am not gonna get fired, because I\xc2\x92m not gonna act on it.'
Phoebe	 So you wouldn\xc2\x92t mind if he was dating someone else?'
Rachel	 Why? Is he? He is! Isn\xc2\x92t he? He\xc2\x92s dating that slut in\nmarketing!'
Ross	 Maybe I should open a divorced men\xc2\x92s club.'
Chandler	 Dude that is so sad.'
Ross	 I could put uh-uh a basketball court in the back.'
Chandler	 Could I play?'
Rachel	 Oh, no sit-ups today Tag?'
Tag	 I just did them.'
Rachel	 Oh, well drop and give me ten more!'
Tag	 What?'
Rachel	 Uh, I-I had a drink with lunch. Did those cost reports come in?'
Tag	 Yeah, I filled them out last night?'
Rachel	 Oh, great could you make me four copies of those?'
Melissa	 Hey Rachel!'
Rachel	 (startled) Ahh, hi! Hi! Melissa, what\xc2\x92s up? I\xc2\x92m just uh, about\nto umm, go out to the store to get some stuff to put in my backpack. Y\xc2\x92know, like\ndried fruit and granola and stuff. What\xc2\x92s up? (She has put on the backpack.)'
Melissa	 Umm, is Tag here?'
Rachel	 No. Why?'
Melissa	 Oh, I was gonna talk to him about doing something tonight.'
Rachel	 Really?! Got a little crush on Tag there do ya?'
Melissa	 Well, we\xc2\x92ve been flirting back and forth, but I was hoping that\ntonight it would turn into something a little more than that.'
Rachel	 Okay, whoa-whoa easy there Melissa! This ain\xc2\x92t a locker room, okay?\nBut, y\xc2\x92know I remember him saying that-that he had plans tonight.'
Melissa	 Oh no!'
Rachel	 Oh yeah. All right, back to work.'
Melissa	 Hey! Isn\xc2\x92t that Tag\xc2\x92s backpack.'
Rachel	 Yeah Melissa, I don\xc2\x92t want to be known as the uh, office bitch, but\nI will call your supervisor.'
The Photographer	 (taking pictures) Great! That\xc2\x92s great Monica! Great! Now,\nChandler, you want to give us a smile?'
Chandler	 Okay. (Does The Face.)'
The Photographer	 I\xc2\x92m sorry, is the seat uncomfortable?'
Chandler	 No, I am.'
Monica	 Chandler, listen to me sweetie, I know you can do this. Okay? You have a\nbeautiful smile.'
Chandler	 I do? (He smiles, beautifully.)'
Monica	 Yeah! (They turn to the camera, and Chandler does The Face again.) All\nright, maybe you don\xc2\x92t have to smile. Let\xc2\x92s try something else. Let\xc2\x92s try\numm, try looking sexy.'
Chandler	 Okay. (You\xc2\x92ll have to see it, I can\xc2\x92t describe the face he\nmakes, but it isn\xc2\x92t good.)'
Monica	 Or not.'
Rachel	 Hi Joey! What are you doing here?'
Joey	 Uhh, well I\xc2\x92ve got an audition down the street and I spilled sauce\nall over the front of my shirt. (Removes his hand to reveal a huge sauce stain.) You got\nan extra one?'
Rachel	 Yeah, sure. Umm\xc2\x85here. (Hands him one.)'
Joey	 Great. (He doesn\xc2\x92t like it.) You got anything that\xc2\x92s not Ralph\nLauren?'
Rachel	 Yeah, I don\xc2\x92t think so Joe.'
Joey	 All right, I guess this will be fine.'
Rachel	 Hey, listen umm, what-what are you doing tonight?'
Joey	 Nothing, why?'
Rachel	 How would you feel about taking out my assistant Tag? I\xc2\x92ll pay.'
Joey	 Huh, Rach I got to say it\xc2\x92s gonna take a lot of money for me to go\nout on a date with a dude.'
Rachel	 I\xc2\x92m not asking you to go on a date with him!'
Joey	 Really? \xc2\x91Cause I could kinda use the money.'
Rachel	 Joey, just-just he-he\xc2\x92s new in town and I know he doesn\xc2\x92t have\nany guy friends. Just take him to like a ball game or something. I\xc2\x92ll really\nappreciate it.'
Joey	 Yeah, okay.'
Rachel	 Yeah?'
Joey	 Sure, no problem. (Sees something.) Ooh\xc2\x97Hey, donuts!'
Rachel	 Yeah!'
Joey	 Okay. (He grabs a jelly donut, takes a bite, and guess what he spills all\nover himself. He tries to clean it up and smears it all over the shirt.)'
Monica	 I know. Let\xc2\x92s try a look\xc2\x85of far off\xc2\x85wonderment. Okay,\nwe\xc2\x92ll-we\xc2\x92ll gaze into our future and we\xc2\x92ll think about our marriage and the\ndays to come. (Chandler is still not getting it.) Chandler! What is the matter with your\nface?! I mean this picture is supposed to say "Geller and Bing to be married,"\nnot "Local woman saves drowning moron!" (The photographer laughs.) Hey!\nDon\xc2\x92t laugh at him! He\xc2\x92s my drowning moron!'
Chandler	 Aww! (Smiles.)'
Monica	 That\xc2\x92s it! Take it! Take it! Take it!'
Ross	 I like this one. (Points to it.) It seems to say, "I love you and\nthat\xc2\x92s why I have to kill you."'
Monica	 They can\xc2\x92t all be bad. (To Chandler) Find the one where you make\nyour bedroom eyes. Ohh, there it is.'
Chandler	 Oh my God! Those are my bedroom eyes?! Why did you ever sleep with me?'
Monica	 Do you really want to pull at that thread?'
Phoebe	 I\xc2\x92m having a really good time!'
Hums While He Pees	 Me too! I\xc2\x92m sorry that guy in the subway licked your\nneck.'
Phoebe	 Ohh. No that\xc2\x92s okay, he\xc2\x92s a friend.'
Hums While He Pees	 Hey uh, I don\xc2\x92t mean to be presumptuous but I have\nthese two tickets to the ballroom dancing finals tomorrow night if you want to go?'
Phoebe	 Yeah, I\xc2\x85 Well y\xc2\x92know I-I mean I missed the-the semi-finals, so\nI\xc2\x92d just be lost.'
Hums While He Pees	 I know it\xc2\x92s really lame, but I got these tickets from\nmy boss and\xc2\x97Oh no! No! No! My God!'
Phoebe	 Okay, don\xc2\x92t freak out. I\xc2\x92ll go.'
Hums While He Pees	 No it\xc2\x92s\xc2\x85 Uh, my ex-wife Whitney is out there. I\ncannot deal with her right now. That woman is crazy!'
Phoebe	 Okay, I know. Hold on. (She walks over to the couch.) Hey Ross?'
Ross	 Yeah?'
Phoebe	 Yeah, umm that\xc2\x92s Whitney (Points), Kyle\xc2\x92s ex-wife out there,\nnow do you think that you can y\xc2\x92know divert her so that we can slip out?'
Ross	 What?! No!'
Phoebe	 Well okay but I have two tickets to the ballroom dance finals. (She\nholds up the tickets that Kyle gave her.)'
Ross	 Look, I don\xc2\x92t think so Pheebs. (Pause) All right, I\xc2\x92ll do it.\nBut just because you\xc2\x92re a friend. (Grabs the tickets and heads to divert Whitney.)'
Phoebe	 Hi Ginger.'
Ross	 All right! I want my key back!'
Phoebe	 I don\xc2\x92t have it!'
Ross	 It\xc2\x92s right there! (Points to her hand.)'
Phoebe	 Ugh, okay Sherlock! (Hands over the key.)'
Ross	 Look, I\xc2\x92m sorry but you-you-you better go Pheebs.'
Phoebe	 All right, well I just wanted to say thank you though for diverting\nKyle\xc2\x92s ex. '
Ross	 Oh yeah\xc2\x97No\xc2\x97You\xc2\x92re welcome. We\xc2\x92ll talk about it later.'
Phoebe	 Okay.'
Ross	 Hi Whitney.'
Whitney	 Hi Ross! You ready for breakfast?'
Ross	 Yep. (Phoebe slams the door shut.) Okay.'
Phoebe	 (To Ross) Kyle\xc2\x92s ex-wife? You were supposed to divert her not date\nher!'
Ross	 (opens the door and to Whitney) Hi! I\xc2\x92m sorry, but can you give me a\nsecond while I talk to this woman, who by the way did not spend the night.'
Whitney	 Sure.'
Ross	 Okay. (Closes the door.) (To Phoebe) I did divert her and we ended\nup having a great time! Okay?'
Phoebe	 Watching ballroom dancing?'
Ross	 Yes! That\xc2\x92s where we realized we were both super cool people!'
Phoebe	 Well look-look, okay Ross, Kyle just told me some really bad\nstuff about her.'
Ross	 Like what?'
Phoebe	 Like she\xc2\x92s really mean, and she\xc2\x92s over critical,\nand-and\xc2\x97No! She will paint a room a really bright color without even checking\nwith you!'
Ross	 Okay.'
Phoebe	 And! She uses sex as a weapon!'
Ross	 Fine! Thank you for warning me. At breakfast I\xc2\x92ll be on full alert\nfor room painting and sex weapons.'
Phoebe	 You\xc2\x92re still gonna go out with her?!'
Ross	 Yeah!'
Phoebe	 Well, didn\xc2\x92t you just hear what I said?!'
Ross	 Pheebs come on! I mean, consider the source! Of course her\nex-husband\xc2\x92s gonna say that stuff. Now, if you\xc2\x92ll excuse me\xc2\x85'
Phoebe	 (interrupting him) No listen to me! She is crazy!'
Whitney	 (outside the door) Uh, your door isn\xc2\x92t sound proof.'
Phoebe	 You see? Nothing is good enough for her!'
Tag	 Good morning.'
Rachel	 Hi Tag! Hey, so did you have fun with uh, with Joey last night?'
Tag	 Oh yeah! We went to the Knicks game.'
Rachel	 Ohh that\xc2\x92s nice.'
Tag	 Then we went to this bar and he hooked us up with all these women! '
Rachel	 Wo-women? You mean like old women?'
Tag	 Well kinda old, like 30.'
Rachel	 (Pause) Oh.'
Tag	 And I never used to be able to just talk to girls in bars, but I got like\n20 phone numbers last night.'
Rachel	 That\xc2\x92s great! Wow man, so Joey must\xc2\x92ve really taught you some\nstuff huh?'
Tag	 A little.'
Rachel	 Yeah?'
Tag	 (To her, in the Joey voice) How you doin\xc2\x92?'

Joey	 See? That\xc2\x92s a great smile! Easy. Natural. Now, pretend I have a\ncamera. (Chandler immediately does The Face.) You\xc2\x92re changing it!'
Chandler	 I can\xc2\x92t help it!'
Joey	 All right, all right, all right, all right, you wanna know what I do when\nI take resume shots?'
Chandler	 Borrow money from me?'
Joey	 Okay, first\xc2\x97first of all, you want to make it look spontaneous. I\nlook down (Looks down), look down, keep looking down; then I look up. (Looks up and\nsmiles.) See? All right, now you try. Look down (Chandler looks down), you\xc2\x92re looking\ndown, keep looking down\xc2\x85'
Chandler	 Why is there jelly on your shoe?'
Joey	 I had a donut. (Chandler nods.)'
Rachel	 (entering) Hi!'
Joey	 Hey!'
Chandler	 Hey!'
Rachel	 So uh, heard you had some fun with Tag last night.'
Joey	 Yeah! That guy\xc2\x92s all right!'
Rachel	 Yeah and you had fun teaching him how to be all Joey.'
Joey	 What?'
Rachel	 Y\xc2\x92know, all the women.'
Joey	 Hey well, you can\xc2\x92t teach someone to be good with women. Y\xc2\x92know,\nthat\xc2\x92s why I never had any luck with Chandler.'
Chandler	 (Pause) I\xc2\x92m right here!'
Rachel	 All right, would-would you mind just not going out with him again? Okay,\njust the idea of you and he and all these women, it\xc2\x92s just\xc2\x97And I know he\xc2\x92s\nmy assistant and I can\xc2\x92t date him\xc2\x97but it just bothers me, all right?!'
Joey	 Hey! No-no-no-no, you can\xc2\x92t take him away from me! I got a great\npartner to pick up girls with! Finally!!'
Chandler	 I\xc2\x92m still right here!'
Rachel	 All right, will you, will you at least tell him how hollow and\nunsatisfying this, dating tons of women thing is!'
Joey	 (shocked) What?!'
Rachel	 I just don\xc2\x92t want him to meet anybody until I am over my\ncrush\xc2\x97And I will get over it. It\xc2\x92s-it\xc2\x92s not like I love him, it\xc2\x92s just\nphysical! But\xc2\x97I mean I get crushes like this all the time! I mean hell, I had a crush\non you when I first met ya!'
Joey	 I know, Monica told me.'
Chandler	 Did you have a crush on me, when you first met me?'
Rachel	 Yeah. Sure. (Joey nods his head questioningly and Rachel nods no.)'
Chandler	 Can you people not see me?! (He waves his arms around to get their\nattention.)'
Rachel	 (To Joey) So, will you talk to him?'
Joey	 I don\xc2\x92t know Rach.'
Rachel	 Oh, come on! I\xc2\x92ll give you ten free Ralph Lauren shirts.'
Joey	 One! (Pause.) No ten! You said ten! You can\xc2\x92t take that back!'
Tag	 Hey Joey, you wanted to talk to me?'
Joey	 I don\xc2\x92t know. You uh, you got something for me?'
Tag	 Oh, yeah, this is from Rachel.'
Joey	 Ten. Okay. Now Tag there\xc2\x92s such a thing as to many women.'
Tag	 Really?'
Joey	 Yeah, for you!'
Monica	 (seeing him approach) Hey! There you are!'
Chandler	 There I am!'
Monica	 Are you okay?'
Chandler	 Yeah, Joey said I uh, I needed to relax so he gave me an\nantihistamine.'
Monica	 What?!'
Chandler	 Yeah, and then I fell asleep on the subway and went all the way to\nBrooklyn. Brooklyn is f-far!!'
Monica	 Chandler, what were you thinking?'
Chandler	 I don\xc2\x92t know, but don\xc2\x92t worry, don\xc2\x92t worry, because I\nknow how to take a picture now. (They get ready) Okay, see? Look down (Looks down), look\ndown, look down\xc2\x85 (He falls asleep.)'
Monica	 Chandler?'
Chandler	 (awakens) Yeah! (Looks up and does The Face.)'
Phoebe	 Hi.'
Ross	 Hi.'
Phoebe	 So, how are things going with crazy? Has she cooked your rabbit yet?'
Ross	 Listen, you are hearing one side of the story, okay\xc2\x97and F.Y.I\nshe must\xc2\x92ve shown Kyle over 30 paint samples before she painted that room! And his\nresponse to each one was, "I don\xc2\x92t give a tiny rat\xc2\x92s ass."'
Phoebe	 Yeah well, maybe she should\xc2\x92ve spent a little less time decorating\nand a little more time in the bedroom.'
Ross	 Well, I don\xc2\x92t think we are gonna have that problem, but maybe\nthat\xc2\x92s just because I am not emotionally unavailable!'
Phoebe	 You think he\xc2\x92s emotionally unavailable?'
Ross	 I think he can be.'
Phoebe	 Well, maybe he wouldn\xc2\x92t be she didn\xc2\x92t bring the office home\nevery night!'
Ross	 Well, excuse her for knowing what she wants to do with her life!'
Phoebe	 Yeah well, she certainly knew what she was doing New Year\xc2\x92s Eve\n1997.'
Ross	 (angrily) I knew you were gonna throw that in my face!! That\nwas three years ago! She apologized and she apologized! What more do you want?!!'
Phoebe	 (gets up and starts to leave) We want the last six years back!!'
Ross	 So do we!! So do we!! (Ross notices a couple has been staring at them.)\nI\xc2\x92m sorry you had to see that.'
Tag	 Good morning Rachel.'
Rachel	 Hi! (He hands her, her mail) Thanks, hey so uh what\xc2\x92d you do last\nnight?'
Tag	 Went out with Joey.'
Rachel	 Oh yeah? Another night of birdogging the chickas?'
Tag	 No. We had a really good talk. I don\xc2\x92t think I\xc2\x92m gonna do that\nbar scene anymore.'
Rachel	 Wow! I did not see that coming.'
Tag	 It\xc2\x92s just not really who I am. Y'know, I\xc2\x92ve always been happier\nwhen\xc2\x85Why am I telling you this? You don\xc2\x92t care about this stuff."
Rachel	 Oh no, yes I do! I do! I mean, come on go on, you were, you were saying\nI am happier when uh, y\xc2\x92know?'
Tag	 When I\xc2\x92m in a relationship, I love having a girlfriend.'
Rachel	 Really?'
Tag	 Someone I can spoil, y\xc2\x92know?'
Rachel	 Sp-spoil?'
Tag	 Uh-huh! Let me ask you something?'
Rachel	 Uh-huh.'
Tag	 Do you believe that there is one perfect person for everyone?'
Rachel	 Well, I-I\xc2\x92m startin\xc2\x92 too.'
Tag	 And if that person is already in your life, you should do something about\nit right?'
Rachel	 Yes! Hell yes!'
Tag	 All right then, it\xc2\x92s settled.'
Rachel	 Okay.'
Tag	 I\xc2\x92m gettin\xc2\x92 back together with my ex-girlfriend.'
Rachel	 I\xc2\x92d love to!'
Tag	 What?'
Rachel	 (panics, turns around, picks up the phone, and pretend to talk on it)\nHello?! (Listens) Oh, yeah! (To Tag) This is gonna be a while. Excuse me. (Tag leaves and\nshe closes the door behind him, disgustedly.) Yeah!'
Ross	 My God!'
Phoebe	 Oh, I\xc2\x92m sorry. Is that annoying? And speaking about being selfish\nin bed, how\xc2\x92s Whitney?'
Ross	 Well maybe she wouldn\xc2\x92t have to be selfish in bed if someone else\nknew where everything was!'
Phoebe	 Oh he knows! (Quietly) For the most part.'
Kyle	 Oh hey! Good, you\xc2\x92re both here.'
Whitney	 We kinda need to talk.'
Phoebe	 Both of you together?'
Ross	 Wh-what\xc2\x92s up?'
Whitney	 Well, I went over to Kyle\xc2\x92s last night to pick up a few things and\nwe got to reminiscing\xc2\x85'
Kyle	 \xc2\x85we talked through most of the night and we realized that the reason\nwe were so angry at each other was because there are still feelings there. So\xc2\x85\n(Pause)'
Ross	 Oh just say it Kyle!'
Kyle	 We\xc2\x92re gonna give it another try.'
Phoebe	 What about her whining and her constant need for attention?!'
Whitney	 I\xc2\x92m gonna work on that.'
Phoebe	 Oh right, because you\xc2\x92re so capable of change.'
Ross	 (To Whitney) Y\xc2\x92know, he hums when he pees!'
Whitney	 I do know.'
Ross	 It makes him miss the bowl, but whatever.'
Whitney	 We\xc2\x92re so sorry. (They get up to leave.)'
Ross	 That\xc2\x92s all right, we-we don\xc2\x92t need you. In fact, hey I\xc2\x92m\nover it already.'
Phoebe	 Yeah, and y\xc2\x92know what? I don\xc2\x92t give a tiny rat\xc2\x92s ass.'
Kyle	 Yeah, we\xc2\x92re gonna go. (They leave.)'
Ross	 (To Phoebe) I\xc2\x92m sorry. Ugh, Pheebs, you were, you were right about\nher. Y\xc2\x92know, she did try to use sex as a weapon! Yeah, I hurt my back a\nlittle.'
Phoebe	 Oh. Y\xc2\x92know, he hums while he does other stuff to.'
Ross	 Yeah, were better off without them.'
Phoebe	 And y\xc2\x92know, even if they break up again, you\xc2\x92d better not let\nhim in your sad men\xc2\x92s club!'
Ross	 Divorced men\xc2\x92s club.'
Phoebe	 Potato, Potaato. (She\xc2\x92s pronounces potato with the both the short\nand long As.)'

Monica	 Hey guys check it out! My mom sent me the paper!'
Phoebe	 Ooh, let\xc2\x92s see it!'
Chandler	 Ahhh.'
Monica	 Okay. (She opens it up and shows it to them.)'
Chandler	 Oh yeah, that looks good.'
Phoebe	 You guys make a very attractive couple. (The camera cuts to a\nshot of the picture and we see that Monica is posing with Joey instead of Chandler.)'
Joey	 Yeah, we look great together.'
Monica	 Yeah, we really do!'
Chandler	 Okay.'
Monica	 Wow! Imagine what our kids would look like!'
