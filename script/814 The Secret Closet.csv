Monica	 (opens the door wearing a robe, but leaves the chain on) Hey,\nwhat\xc2\x92s up?'
Phoebe	 Well, I left my guitar here again.'
Monica	 Oh, okay. No problem.'
Phoebe	 Okay. (Monica closes the door, gets the guitar, and then hands it out.)'
Monica	 Okay.'
Phoebe	 Oh.'
Monica	 Here you go.'
Phoebe	 Okay. '
Monica	 Okay.'
Phoebe	 Great! Umm\xc2\x85(Monica closes the door again and Phoebe knocks again.)'
Monica	 What?!'
Phoebe	 So do you want to hang out or something?'
Monica	 Phoebe! You kinda caught me at a bad time.'
Phoebe	 Oh are you and Chandler\xc2\x85'
Monica	 Yes! Exactly.'
Phoebe	 Okay. Do you guys want me to play for you?'
Monica	 (laughs) No. (Closes the door as Chandler walks up.)'
Chandler	 Hey Pheebs, what\xc2\x92s up?'
Phoebe	 You ask an intriguing question Chandler Bing.'
Phoebe	 Oh my God! You\xc2\x92re getting a massage! You never let me massage you!!'
Monica	 Phoebe, I can explain!'
Phoebe	 You told me you hate massages!'
Chandler	 Buy stamps, pick up dry cleaning\xc2\x85Don\xc2\x92t let Phoebe in.'
Phoebe	 I can\xc2\x92t believe this! How long as this been going on?'
Monica	 Well umm, Alexandra has been\xc2\x85'
Phoebe	 Oh, it has a name?'
Monica	 Phoebe, don\xc2\x92t get upset!'
Phoebe	 Okay\xc2\x97Oop! Too late! I\xc2\x92m leaving! Come on Chandler let\xc2\x92s\ngo! (She storms out.)'
Chandler	 Well, Phoebe I thought I\xc2\x92d\xc2\x97(Off Phoebe\xc2\x92s\nlook)\xc2\x97Yeah, what the hell. (Exits with Phoebe.)'

Joey	 Oh okay, okay! One more push! One more push! Come on honey, we\xc2\x92re\nalmost there! We\xc2\x92re almost there!'
Rachel	 Oh Joey, I\xc2\x92m so happy things worked out for us that we\xc2\x92re\nhaving this baby together. I love you so much.'
Joey	 Oh, I love you too.'
Rachel	 And I hope it\xc2\x92s not an inappropriate time to say this but,\nyou\xc2\x92re the best sex I ever had.'
Joey	 That\xc2\x92s always appropriate! (Back to the matter at hand) Oh, okay. One\nmore push! One more push!'
Doctor	 Oh, here is your beautiful baby. Congratulations! '
Ross	 (crying) I hope you\xc2\x92re a better father than you\xc2\x92re a friend!!\n(Cries again and Joey wakes up in horror.)'
Rachel	 (bursts into the room) Joey! Joey!'
Joey	 What? What\xc2\x92s going on?'
Rachel	 Come feel this! Come feel my belly!'
Joey	 Aaaah\xc2\x85'
Rachel	 Joey! The baby is kicking for the first time! Will you please come feel\nthis?!'
Joey	 Really?!'
Rachel	 Yes!'
Joey	 Oh, y\xc2\x92know what? Maybe uh, you\xc2\x85you should come to me. I\xc2\x92m a\nnot, I\xc2\x92m not wearing any bottoms.'
Rachel	 Oh, okay! (She goes over to him and he feels her belly.)'
Joey	 Oh my, oh my God!'
Rachel	 Aw, it\xc2\x92s unbelievable! Wow! She is kicking so much! Oh, she\xc2\x92s\nlike umm\xc2\x85oh\xc2\x85who\xc2\x92s that kind of annoying girl soccer player?'
Joey	 Mia Hamm?'
Rachel	 Mia Hamm!'
Joey	 Oh that\xc2\x92s amazing. (Drops the sheet.)'
Rachel	 (looking down) Oh-oh!! One hand on the sheet Joe!'
Joey	 Whoa-hey-oh! Sorry!'
Chandler	 Hey babe.'
Monica	 Hi honey. We just got a wedding gift from Bob and Faye Bing; they\ndon\xc2\x92t like us do they? (They gave them a pok-a-dotted punch bowl.)'
Chandler	 Who says you can\xc2\x92t get a nice punch bowl for under six bucks?\nMaybe we can take it back?'
Monica	 No, it doesn\xc2\x92t say where it came from. Where would we return it?'
Chandler	 How about to the street say from the balcony?'
Monica	 Why don\xc2\x92t we just find a place for it?'
Chandler	 Okay. How about in that cabinet?'
Monica	 No! That\xc2\x92s where we keep the canned goods! Have you completely\nforgotten everything you learned at orientation?'
Chandler	 How about the closet by the bathroom? (The secret green door by the\nbathroom.)'
Monica	 Oh, okay. Here, why don\xc2\x92t you let me do it?'
Chandler	 Oh no-no-no, I will do it. Honey, you have to learn to sit down and\nrelax and let your husband take care of things once and awhile. (Tries the door.)\nIt\xc2\x92s locked, you have to help me. Why is it locked?'
Monica	 No reason. I-I keep private things in there.'
Chandler	 Oh y\xc2\x92know, I\xc2\x92ve been living here a while and I\xc2\x92ve never\nseen what\xc2\x92s inside that closet. What is, what is in there?'
Monica	 Feminine stuff.'
Chandler	 Don\xc2\x92t try to make me uncomfortable with feminine stuff!'
Monica	 Chandler, there is nothing in there that concerns you! If you love me\nyou-you\xc2\x92ll let it go.'
Chandler	 Fine.'
Monica	 Thank you! (He tries the door again and Monica glares at him.)'
Chandler	 (walking casually away) Love you.'
Phoebe	 (entering) Hello Chandler, lovely day huh? (To Monica) You!'
Chandler	 Phoebe if it helps Alexandra has only been massaging Monica for like\nthree years. (Phoebe rolls her eyes and walks away and Monica glares at him.) If! I said,\n"If it helps!" (Goes to the bedroom.)'
Phoebe	 Why won\xc2\x92t you let me massage you?'
Monica	 Well it\xc2\x92s\xc2\x85I mean I\xc2\x92d just\xc2\x97I\xc2\x92d be\nself-conscious. You\xc2\x92re my friend; I\xc2\x92d be naked.'
Phoebe	 Monica! We lived together for years! I\xc2\x92ve seen you naked!'
Monica	 That\xc2\x92s different, we were roommates! And when?!'
Phoebe	 I\xc2\x92m curious about the human body.'
Monica	 Hey, come on Phoebe, you can understand why this would be weird for me.'
Phoebe	 But I\xc2\x92m a professional! And I\xc2\x92m really good! Look, if\nyou\xc2\x92re uncomfortable we can stop. Just give me a chance, okay. Please?'
Monica	 Okay, if it means that much to you\xc2\x85'
Phoebe	 It does! How would you feel if you couldn\xc2\x92t share your cooking?\nOr-or imagine how Ross would feel if he couldn\xc2\x92t teach us about dragons.'
Monica	 Dinosaurs.'
Phoebe	 Potato, potaato. '
Ross	 Hey!'
Joey	 Hey Ross! The baby\xc2\x92s kicking!'
Ross	 What?! It is?! (He tries to quickly remove his gloves, but runs into\ntrouble and finally throws them off of his hands like a hockey player in a fight and grabs\nRachel\xc2\x92s belly.)'
Rachel	 It\xc2\x92s not kicking right now. Although we would love to see you do\n(Mimics him) that again.'
Ross	 Hey, when-when was it kicking? What happened?'
Rachel	 Last night! I just felt it and I went into Joey\xc2\x92s room and he was\nsleeping\xc2\x85'
Joey	 A dreamless sleep.'
Ross	 My God, the baby\xc2\x92s kicking. That\xc2\x92s great. Although I\xc2\x85kinda\nwish I-I would\xc2\x92ve been there to feel the kicking for the first time y\xc2\x92know.'
Joey	 Well I got stuff going on in here (Rubbing his belly) if you wanna feel.'
Ross	 Look, I-I don\xc2\x92t want to miss anymore baby stuff. So\xc2\x85Here.\nHere\xc2\x92s my new pager number, okay? Anytime anything pregnancy related happens use it!\nI\xc2\x92ll be there! Okay? I don\xc2\x92t care if it\xc2\x92s three in the morning and all you\nwant is ice cream.'
Joey	 Wow! Can I get a copy of that?'
Phoebe	 (calling from her room) Are you under the sheet?'
Monica	 Yes. '
Phoebe	 (in a soothing voice) Great, let\xc2\x92s begin. (She starts the massage.)\nHow\xc2\x92s the pressure?'
Monica	 Nice! Wow Phoebe you are good!'
Phoebe	 Stating the obvious, but thank you. And it\xc2\x92s not weird is it.'
Monica	 No. Ooohh\xc2\x85'
Phoebe	 That\xc2\x92s right, you just enjoy.'
Monica	 (in a sexy voice) Oh. Oh yeah! Ohhhhh! Ohh! Oh yeah! '
Phoebe	 (getting uncomfortable) Okay.'
Monica	 Oh God Phoebe!! (Phoebe covers one ear.) Oh that\xc2\x92s it! That\xc2\x92s\nit! Right there! Oh! (Tries to cover the other ear.) Ooooh-oooh-ooooh\xc2\x85 (Covers both\nears and continues the massage with her elbows.)'
Chandler	 I wasn\xc2\x92t trying to open your closet! I wasn\xc2\x92t trying to open\nyour closet! I swear! (Running into the kitchen and sees its Joey.)'
Joey	 Whoa, Monica runs a pretty tight ship over here. What are you doing?'
Chandler	 Monica has a secret closet and she won\xc2\x92t let me see what\xc2\x92s\nin it.'
Joey	 Why not?'
Chandler	 I don\xc2\x92t know! What could she possibly be hiding in here that I\ncan\xc2\x92t see?!'
Joey	 I don\xc2\x92t know. Ooh, I bet it\xc2\x92s Richard.'
Chandler	 Why would Monica be keeping Richard in here?'
Joey	 Well off the top of my head uhh, maybe she\xc2\x92s having her cake and\neating it too. You being the cake and Richard being the too. Or!'
Chandler	 And here we go\xc2\x85'
Joey	 I saw this movie once where there was a door and no one knew what was\nbehind it, and when they finally got it open millions and millions and millions of bugs\ncame pouring out and they feasted on human flesh. Y\xc2\x92know it wouldn\xc2\x92t kill ya to\nrespect your wife\xc2\x92s privacy! (He walks away and into his apartment and looks the\ndoor.) Stupid closet full of bugs!'
Rachel	 Joey. Joey, something feels weird and not good weird. I\ndon\xc2\x92t\xc2\x97Whoa!! (Winces in pain.)'
Joey	 Oh hey whoa-whoa, don\xc2\x92t worry. Okay. When my sisters were pregnant\nthey got every weird feeling in the book, it was always nothing.'
Rachel	 Really?'
Joey	 Absolutely. But, we\xc2\x92re gonna stop by the hospital just to be\nsure, okay? I\xc2\x92ll page Ross on the way. Come on.'
Rachel	 Okay. Oh God\xc2\x97Ow!\xc2\x97Oo!'
Joey	 Okay Rach-Rach-Rach look at me, look at me, everything\xc2\x92s gonna be\nfine, trust me. Okay. Take my hand. Here we go. (Rachel grabs his hand.) Oww crushing\nbones!'
Joey	 Hey! So?'
Dr. Long	 She\xc2\x92s fine. She\xc2\x92s experiencing Braxton-Hicks contractions,\nmild discomfort caused by contractions in the uterine wall.'
Rachel	 Hmm, mild discomfort. So I take it you\xc2\x92ve had one of these Braxton\nthingies?'
Joey	 So but everything is normal.'
Dr. Long	 Absolutely.'
Joey	 And-and there\xc2\x92s no danger to her and the baby?'
Dr. Long	 No-no. Contractions can be unnerving if you don\xc2\x92t know what they\nare, but she\xc2\x92s fine.'
Rachel	 Thank you doctor. (Dr. Long exits.) (To Joey) Oh thank you for being so\nnice and calm.'
Joey	 Calm?! I wasn\xc2\x92t calm! I\xc2\x92ve never been more scared in all my\nlife!'
Rachel	 But wait you said everything was gonna be okay.'
Joey	 Well what do I know?! I\xc2\x92m not a doctor!'
Rachel	 But I\xc2\x97But everything is okay. I\xc2\x92m fine!'
Joey	 You sure?!'
Rachel	 Yes! Yes! I got half a mind to contract that doctor\xc2\x92s uterus\nthough. Mild discomfort, what\xc2\x92s he talking about?'
Joey	 (seeing Ross) Oh hey-hey!'
Ross	 (rushes in) Is everything okay?'
Rachel	 Yeah, everything\xc2\x92s fine!'
Ross	 Your page said come to the hospital, what? What was it? What happened?'
Joey	 Something called Braxton-Hicks contractions.'
Ross	 Oh. Oh. Thank God, most women don\xc2\x92t even feel them.'
Rachel	 Okay, no uterus, no opinion.'
Joey	 Hey uh, what\xc2\x92s with the candy?'
Ross	 Oh when you beeped me I was on line at the concession stand at the movie\ntheater.'
Rachel	 Oh you went to the movies by yourself?'
Ross	 No I\xc2\x97Mona!'
Rachel	 Oh, I gotta go back in there.'
Ross	 What? Why? What\xc2\x92s wrong?'
Rachel	 No, everything\xc2\x92s fine. I just gotta go back\xc2\x85'
Ross	 No really, you tell me what\xc2\x92s up.'
Rachel	 I-I forgot my underwear. (Ross lets her go.)'
Ross	 (To Joey) So, thanks so much for bringing her to the hospital.'
Joey	 Oh hey, don\xc2\x92t worry about it man. Don\xc2\x92t worry about it, no big\ndeal.'
Ross	 Yeah but still, I mean it should\xc2\x92ve been me. I\xc2\x92m the dad.'
Dr. Long	 (To Joey) Uh, if you have any questions, here\xc2\x92s some information\non Braxton-Hicks. (Hands Joey a pamphlet.) Oh and by the way, you did the right thing by\nbringing her in. You\xc2\x92re gonna make a wonderful father.'
Joey	 Oh uh, hey. Not as good as this guy! (Grabs Ross around the shoulders.) He\nbrought Twizlers!'

Chandler	 There has got to be a way!'
Joey	 Easy there Captain Kirk. Oh, do you have a bobby pin?'
Chandler	 Yeah. (Checks his hair.) Oh no wait, I\xc2\x92m not an nine-year-old\ngirl.'
Joey	 Then why do you throw like one?'
Chandler	 Maybe Monica has a bobby pin.'
Joey	 Sure. "Monica."'
Chandler	 So, how\xc2\x92s the hideously inappropriate crush on Rachel coming?'
Joey	 Uh, really good. Really good. Yeah, I should be ready to kill myself any\nday now. (Chandler returns with a bobby pin and hands it to Joey.) Wow, you sure found\nthat quick. (He tries the pin in the lock.) I just\xc2\x97I wish I didn\xc2\x92t feel this way\nabout Rachel anymore, y\xc2\x92know? I wish things could go back to normal. I mean, I love\nliving with her and God, helping out with the baby is just amazing, but now I think\xc2\x85I\nthink Ross feels left out. Y\xc2\x92know? When I had to take Rachel to the hospital, the\ndoctor thought I was the father. God\xc2\x85 You should\xc2\x92ve seen the look on Ross\xc2\x92s\nface. (Pause) By the way, I have no idea what I\xc2\x92m doing here. For all I know I\xc2\x92m\njust locking it more. Oh hey, did you try opening it with a credit card?'
Chandler	 That\xc2\x92s a good idea.'
Joey	 Yeah.'
Chandler	 Okay. (They switch places and Chandler gets out a credit card.) So uh,\nRoss is kinda bummed huh?'
Joey	 Oh, I just\xc2\x85I feel terrible.'
Chandler	 Well, it\xc2\x92s not your fault. What are you gonna do? Not take her to\nthe hospital? Y\xc2\x92know? You\xc2\x92re doing nothing wrong. (Pause) Except for harboring\nan all consuming love for the woman whose carrying his baby. (He loses his card behind the\ndoor.) Richard? If-if you\xc2\x92re in there, could you pass me my credit card?'
Monica	 Hey.'
Phoebe	 Hey.'
Monica	 I gotta tell you, yesterday was amazing. That massage felt so good!'
Phoebe	 No-no, I got that.'
Monica	 So umm, what do you say we make it a weekly appointment?'
Phoebe	 Okay. Okay but you should know though, I\xc2\x92ve raised my rates to $200\nan hour.'
Monica	 Okay.'
Phoebe	 I mean $500.'
Monica	 What?'
Phoebe	 600.'
Monica	 What\xc2\x92s going on?'
Phoebe	 Oh, you make sex noises when you get massaged!'
Monica	 What? (Laughs.)'
Phoebe	 Yeah, and it really freaked me out! And after a while I even tried to\nhurt you and it just spurred you on.'
Monica	 What?! You\xc2\x92re crazy! There\xc2\x92s nothing sexual about the noises I\nmake!'
Phoebe	 Really? There\xc2\x92s nothing sexual about this? (Sexily) Oooh. Oo God!\nOhh. Ohhhh. Ohh. (Some cute guy is watching closely.) (To him) What are you looking at?!\n(Pause) I mean hi.'
Monica	 Oh my\xc2\x97This is so embarrassing. Oh my God, I\xc2\x92m never gonna get\nmassaged again!'
Phoebe	 No, you can\xc2\x92t let this stop you from getting massages! No look, I\nhave, I have lots of clients that make the same noises you do!'
Monica	 Really?!'
Phoebe	 Well not clients, lovers. But let\xc2\x92s just y\xc2\x92know, try it again.\nCome back and-and we\xc2\x92ll work through it.'
Monica	 Are you sure?'
Phoebe	 Yes.'
Monica	 I guess.'
Phoebe	 Great! Okay, if you\xc2\x92ll just excuse me. (To the guy) So, did you\nhear something you liked?'
Rachel	 Hey Ross! Check it out! I learned a new trick!'
Ross	 Hey uh, I brought you some lunch.'
Rachel	 Ohh! That\xc2\x92s so sweet of you! Oh yum! (Takes a bite out of the\nsandwich and starts to get sick.) Did you put pickles on this?'
Ross	 Well yeah!'
Rachel	 Oh Ross!! (Runs to the bathroom and closes the door.)'
Ross	 What?! What?! Rach what?!'
Joey	 What\xc2\x92s going on?'
Ross	 I made her favorite, tuna salad with pickles.'
Joey	 Pickle? Pickles make her sick. Giving her pickles is like giving me salad.'
Ross	 (to Rachel) I-I\xc2\x92m sorry Rach, I didn\xc2\x92t know. Are you gonna be\nokay?'
Rachel	 Yeah, I\xc2\x92ll be fine. But could someone please make sure that\nsandwich is gone when I get out there?'
Joey	 I\xc2\x92m on it! (Takes a bite out of the sandwich.)'
Ross	 I can\xc2\x92t believe this! I shouldn\xc2\x92t be the one making her throw\nup!'
Joey	 Dude relax! It could happen to anyone.'
Ross	 Yeah? Not to you, because you know this stuff. I don\xc2\x92t know any of it\nand I\xc2\x92m the father. I wish I\xc2\x92d be more involved y\xc2\x92know.'
Rachel	 (entering) Well, if anyone is keeping score, I no longer eat tuna.'
Joey	 Hey uh, can I, can I talk to you guys for a second?'
Ross	 Yeah.'
Rachel	 What\xc2\x92s up?'
Joey	 Uh, sit down. I wanna talk about our situation.'
Rachel	 (Gasps) Are you breaking up with us?'
Joey	 The thing is\xc2\x85\xc2\x92cause I live with Rachel I\xc2\x92m here for a lot\nof the stuff, okay? (To Rachel) And Ross\xc2\x85Ross is missing everything. So\xc2\x85'
Rachel	 Yeah?'
Joey	 Maybe you two should live together.'
Rachel	 Are you asking me to move out? Do you not want me here?'
Joey	 Oh no-no, no-no I love living with you. It just seems that\xc2\x85if\nyou\xc2\x92re gonna have a roommate, y\xc2\x92know it might as well be the father.'
Rachel	 But Joey, I don\xc2\x92t think Ross wants me to move into his apartment\nand disrupt his life like that. I mean\xc2\x97(Ross turns to her with wishful eyes.)\xc2\x97Or\nhe does.'
Ross	 No I-I-I would love to be around for you and the baby. And we-we can just\ntry it like on a temporary basis.'
Rachel	 But Ross, its you and me!'
Ross	 So? Sure! But it-it wouldn\xc2\x92t be anything romantic. And\nI\xc2\x92m-I\xc2\x92m dating Mona\xc2\x97Damnit Mona! I was supposed to meet her like an hour\nago! What is wrong with me?!'
Joey	 All right now, so? What do you think?'
Rachel	 I don\xc2\x92t know. Is it crazy?'
Ross	 No! No it\xc2\x92s not. Joey, this is a smart idea.'
Joey	 Well, I was due.'
Rachel	 Okay, let\xc2\x92s do it. I\xc2\x92ll move in.'
Ross	 Really?'
Rachel	 Yeah.'
Ross	 Oh Rach that\xc2\x92s great. That\xc2\x92s great. (They hug and Joey breathes\na sigh of relief.)'
Chandler	 Not to shabby, I got this all off myself\xc2\x85using my wife\xc2\x92s\ntools. (He takes the door off the frame and we finally get to see what\xc2\x92s behind the\ngreen door! It is stacked, floor to ceiling, with junk.) Oh my God!'
Monica	 (entering) (Gasps) How did you get in there?!'
Chandler	 (laughs) You\xc2\x92re messy.'
Monica	 Oh no! You weren\xc2\x92t supposed to see this!'
Chandler	 I married Fred Sanford!'
Monica	 No Chandler, you don\xc2\x92t understand! (Chandler starts singing the\ntheme for Sanford and Son, an old TV show starring Redd Fox.) Okay! Okay! Okay!\nFine! Now you know. Okay? I\xc2\x92m y\xc2\x92know\xc2\x85I\xc2\x92m sick.'
Chandler	 No, honey you\xc2\x92re not sick! Look, I don\xc2\x92t love you because\nyou\xc2\x92re organized, I love you in spite of that.'
Monica	 Really? You promise you won\xc2\x92t tell anyone?'
Chandler	 Yes! And look, now that I know if I got some extra stuff lying around\ncan we, can we share the closet.'
Monica	 Well\xc2\x85it\xc2\x92s just umm\xc2\x85I\xc2\x92m afraid you might mess it up.'
Chandler	 Hey.'
Joey	 Hey.'
Chandler	 So Rachel\xc2\x92s all moved out huh? How are you taking it?'
Joey	 Well uh, I wanted to have a few beers, but uh, I got rid of those because\nRachel couldn\xc2\x92t stand the smell of them. But I have thrown back a lot of orange juice\nwith calcium though. And uh, it\xc2\x92s a couple weeks past it\xc2\x92s expiration date, so\nit\xc2\x92s got a bit of a kick.'
Chandler	 Are you okay?'
Joey	 Are you kidding me? I\xc2\x92m great! Yeah, I\xc2\x92m uh; I\xc2\x92m better\nthan great. I am good. And now that she\xc2\x92s gone, I can uh, I can do all this stuff\naround here that I couldn\xc2\x92t do before. Y\xc2\x92know? Like umm, I can walk around naked\nagain. Y\xc2\x92know? I can uh, I can watch porn in the living room. Right? This is uh, this\nis good for me. Y\xc2\x92know? I like being on my own, I\xc2\x92m uh, better off this way.\nI\xc2\x92m uh, a lone wolf. Y\xc2\x92know? A loner. Alone. All alone. Forever. What\xc2\x92s a\nwolf got to do to get a huh around here?! (Chandler rushes over and hugs him.)'

Monica	 Ohhh.'
Phoebe	 That\xc2\x92s it. Just relax.'
Monica	 Ohh. Oh! Ohh!'
