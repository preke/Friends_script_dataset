Ross	 And that's why, no matter what mommy says, we really \n  were on a break. (baby talk) Yes we were! Yes we were! (picks Emma up) Come \n  here gorgeous. (puts her on his knees and talks to her) Oh! Look at you! You \n  are the cutest little baby ever! You're just a... a little bitty baby, you know \n  that? But you've got... (in a softer voice) You've got big beautiful eyes... \n  Yes you do... and a... and a big round belly. (emphasises the B's) Big baby \n  butt! I like big butts. (raps) I like big butts and I cannot lie / you other \n  brothers can't deny / when a girl walks in with an itty, bitty, waist / and \n  a round thing in your face you get...(Emma laughs) Oh my God, Emma... you're \n  laughing! Oh my God, you've never done that before, have you? You never done \n  that before... Daddy made you laugh, huh? Well, daddy and Sir Mix Alot... What? \n  What? You... you wanna hear some more? Uhm...(raps) My anaconda don't want \n  none / unless you got buns hon... (Emma laughs again and Ross looks worried) \n  I'm a terrible father!"

Chandler	 Hi!'
Joey	 Hey... hey listen... What do you guys know about investments?'
Chandler	 How come?'
Joey	 Well, I'm starting to make good money on the show and \n  I'm thinking... I should probably do something with it."
Monica	 What do you do with your money now?'
Joey	 Well, I just tape it to the back of my toilet tank. \n  (realises that anyone could have overheard that) I didn't say that! It's in \n  a bank guarded by robots!"
Chandler	 Do you have any ideas?'
Joey	 Uh, yeah... This guy at work got me excited about going \n  in on an emu farm. That'd be kinda cool huh? Pitchin' in on the weekends, helping \n  to plant the emus..."
Monica	 Joe... Emus are birds. You raise them for meat.'
Joey	 (laughs) Yeah! Right! (points at Monica) People eat \n  birds... Bird meat... Now do they just fly into your mouth or you go to... you \n  go to a restaurant and you say
Monica	 Joey, I think you should consider something a little \n  less risky. I mean, I think in this market, real estate is your best investment.The \n  Fed. just lowered the rates and the interest on your mortgage is totally deductible. \n  (looks at Chandler) That's right, I know some stuff!"
Joey	 Real estate, huh? Hmmm...'
Monica	 (very excited) Oh, and you know who's selling a great \n  apartment? Richard!"
Chandler	 (imitating Monica) Oh, and you know whose knowledge \n  of her ex-boyfriend is shocking? Monica!'
Monica	 My dad told me. They play golf together.'
Chandler	 Oh, well... Maybe I'll join them some time. I just \n  hope the club doesn't slip out of my hand and beat the moustache off his face."
Phoebe	 Hi!'
Rachel and Monica	 Hey!'
Phoebe	 Listen! You have to help me pick a dress 'cause I'm \n  meeting Mike's parents tonight! (Rachel gasps)"
Monica	 Wow, the boyfriend's parents! That's a big step."
Phoebe	 (sarcastically) Really? That hadn't occurred to me."
Monica	 They just gonna love you, just be yourself.'
Phoebe	 They live on the upper east side on Park Avenue!'
Rachel	 Oh yeah, she can't be herself."
Phoebe	 Okay, so... allright... Which dress? (she holds up \n  two \'Phoebe\' dresses, Rachel and Monica look at them... taking their time, don\'t \n  wanting to hurt Phoebe) You can say "neither".'
Rachel and Monica	 Oh God, neither!'
Monica	 I'm sorry honey, but we're gonna take you shopping. \n  It's gonna be fine."
Rachel	 Yeah, totally! You are in such good hands. And I\'m \n  so good with meeting parents. With the father, you know, you want to flirt a \n  little bit, but not in a gross way. Just kind of like
Monica	 You went out with Wallis Pincer?'
Rachel	 Uh, he took the SAT's for me."
Monica	 I knew you didn't get a 1400!"
Rachel	 Ssshyeah, well, duh! I mean...'
Phoebe	 So... now... What about with Mike's mom?"
Rachel	 Oh, with the mother, just... just constantly tell \n  her how amazing her son is. Take it from me, moms love me. Ross's mom one time \n  actually said I'm like the daughter that she never had."
Monica	  (Monica looks at Rachel in disbelief) She said WHAT?'
Phoebe	 (speaking louder and articulating) That's she's like \n  the daughter she never had. (Phoebe points at her ears) Listen! (Monica looks \n  at Phoebe in a duh! way)"
Rachel	 Hi.'
Ross	 Hi.'
Rachel	 I just finished getting Phoebe all dressed to meet \n  Mike's parents. She's so nervous, it's so sweet!"
Ross	 Guess what? I made Emma laugh today.'
Rachel	 (in disbelief) You WHAT? And I missed it? Because \n  I was giving a makeover to that stupid hippie?'
Ross	 Yeah, and it was uhm... it was like a real little person \n  laugh too. It was... it was like uhm... (Ross tries to impersonate Emma's laugh, \n  but it comes out very squeaky, very high pitched. He laughs about himself but \n  then looks at Rachel, realises that it sounded weird and straightens his face.) \n  Only... only not creepy."
Rachel	 Well... well, what did you do to make her laugh? (excited)'
Ross	 I uhm... Well, I sang... (Rachel gasps) well actually \n  I rapped... Baby Got Back... (Rachel's face changes from excited to angry)"
Rachel	 You WHAT? You sang... to our baby daughter... a song \n  about a guy who likes to have sex with women with giant asses?'
Ross	 But you know what, if you think about it, it actually \n  promotes a healthy uhm... body image... because... even big butts or uhm... \n  juicy doubles.'
Rachel	 (disgusted) owwwww...'
Ross	 Please don't take her away from me!"
Catherine	 Oh hi, come on in. I'm Catherine, the listing agent."
Joey	 Hi I'm Joey. This is Chandler."
Chandler	 So how come Richard's selling the place? Went bankrupt? \n  Medical malpractice? Choked on his own moustache?"
Catherine	 Actually, he is buying a much bigger place. It's \n  got a great view of Central Pa....."
Chandler	 mmm That's enough about you!"
Joey	 Is there anything we should know about the apartment?'
Catherine	 All the appliances are included. There is a lot \n  of light, a new kitchen... I think you guys would be very happy here... (Joey \n  and Chandler both realise what she's assuming and start laughing.)"
Chandler	 No, no, no, no, no, NO! No, no... we're not together. \n  We're not a couple. We're definately not a couple."
Catherine	 Oh... Okay, sorry!'
Joey	 Well, you seem pretty insulted by that. What? I'm not \n  good enough for you? "
Chandler	 We're not gonna have this conversation again... \n  Look at this place. Why am I so intimidated by this guy? Pretentious art, this \n  huge macho couch. When we know all he does is sit around all day crying about \n  losing Monica to a real man! (laughs) You don't think he's here, do you? (Joey \n  looks around)"
Joey	 You know what it is? It's a nice place but I gotta see \n  I don't know if I see myself living here. Oh, oh, oh, let me see... (Joey sits \n  down on the couch, mimes opening a can and puts his hand down his pants) Yeah, \n  I could see it."
Chandler	 (Chandler looks around the place and his eye gets \n  caught by Richard's video collection) Look at these videos. You know, I mean, \n  who does he think he is? Magnum Force, Dirty Harry, Cool Hand Luke... Oh my \n  God!"
Joey	 What?'
Chandler	 There's a tape here with Monica's name on it."
Joey	 Ooh! A tape with a girls name on it. It's probably a \n  sex tape... (realises) Wait a minute... This says Monica... (looks around) And \n  this is Richard's apartment... (realises some more)"
Chandler	 Get there faster! (Joey gasps and finally understands...)'
Mike	 Wow! You look like... like my mom.'
Phoebe	 I'm wearing pantyhose!"
Mike	 Great! Come on in! (Mike kisses her on the cheek. A \n  butler walks in and takes Phoebe's coat.)"
Phoebe	 Oh, thank you! Oh... Oh my God, you're RICH!"
Mike	 No, my parents are rich.'
Phoebe	 Yeah, so... They gotta die someday. (Mike's parents \n  walk in) HELLO!"
Mike	 Mom, dad, this is Phoebe. Phoebe, these are my parents
Phoebe	 (in a very posh accent) Theodore... Bitsy... What \n  a delight!'
Bitsy	 It's so nice to finally meet you!"
Phoebe	 And you... Your home is lovely.'
Bitsy	 Well thank you, I'll give you a tour later. It's actually \n  three floors."
Phoebe	 Holy crap!'
Bitsy	 Phoebe, why don't you come in the living room and meet \n  our friends?"
Phoebe	 Oh, try and stop me!'
Mike	 Hey... Wh... What are you doing?'
Phoebe	 (no accent) I'm trying to get your parents to like \n  me."
Mike	 Yeah, I'm sure they will, but you don't have to do this... \n  I'm wanting them to get to know Phoebe, not (accent) Phoebe..."
Phoebe	 (accent) Got it! It... It's hard to stop..."
Mike	 Well, come on...'
Theodore	 Phoebe, these are our friends, Tom and Sue Angle.'
Bitsy	 Phoebe, come sit. Tell us a little bit about yourself... \n  So where are you from?'
Phoebe	 (no accent) Uhm... Okay, well, allright, uhm... Originally \n  I'm from upstate, but uhm... then my mom killed herself and my stepdad went \n  to prison, so... I just moved to the city where uhm... I actually lived in a \n  burned out Buick LeSabre for a while... (frowns are received) which was okay, \n  that was okay, until uhm... I got hepatitis, you know, 'cause this pimp spit \n  in my mouth and... but I... I got over it and uhm... anyway, now I'm uhm... \n  a freelance massage therapist, uhm... which, you know, isn't always steady money \n  but at least I don't pay taxes, huh... (everyone in the room finds it a bit \n  surreal, which Phoebe realises and starts to talk in the accent again) So... \n  where does everyone summer?"

Phoebe	 God! God! This is not going well.'
Mike	 No, no, no, you're doing fine, really... Why don't you \n  go talk to my dad?"
Phoebe	 Okay, okay, okay, okay... Still sure about me being \n  myself?'
Mike	 Absolutely! Or maybe just a little less pimp spit.'
Phoebe	 So Theodore... I uhm... I can see where Mike gets \n  his good looks from...'
Theodore	 Oh... Well...'
Phoebe	 Yeah... And that physique! You must work out all the \n  time...'
Theodore	 Oh no, not all the time... I do the best I can...'
Phoebe	 Yeah I bet! Look out! (Phoebe punches Theodore right \n  in the stomach)'
Theodore	 OH! OWWWWW! (Theodore grabs his stomach in agony)'
Phoebe	 Oh my God, are you okay?'
Theodore	 I recently had surgery.'
Phoebe	 I'm so sorry!"
Theodore	 No, I'll be fine... I just should check the stitches..."
Phoebe	 I really, really am sorry.'
Theodore	 How could you know. Why wouldn't you punch me in \n  the stomach? (Theodore walks out... Mike walks towards Phoebe)"
Mike	 Uhm... Did you just hit my dad?'
Phoebe	 Yes... I'm sorry, I've never met a boyfriends parents \n  before..."
Mike	 But, I mean, you have met... humans before, right? Look, \n  why don't you go talk to my mom?"
Phoebe	 Yeah okay... yeah, your mom... okay... She looks nice, \n  I can talk to her.'
Mike	 Yeah, you do that, and I go check my dad for signs of \n  internal bleeding. (Mike walks away and Bitsy walks in the same direction.)'
Phoebe	 Yeah... Oh Bitsy, hi. Uhm... listen I just wanted \n  to thank you again for having me here tonight.'
Bitsy	 Well, not at all...'
Phoebe	 Also uhm... I just want you to know what a wonderful \n  man your son is.'
Bitsy	 Thank you, I think so too.'
Phoebe	 Well, and you know, it really is a testament to how \n  he was raised. Especially to you. Because he's very respectful of women."
Bitsy	 Is he really?'
Phoebe	 Are you kidding. He is so considerate of my feelings \n  and... you know I think... you'd also like to know that he is a very gentle \n  lover."
Bitsy	 E-e-excuse me?'
Phoebe	 (Mike now enters and stands behind Phoebe) Oh no, \n  no, no, no, no, no. Don't get me wrong. No, he's not in like a sissy way. No, \n  no, no... when he gets going, he can rattle a headboard like a sailor on leave..."
Bitsy	 That's... my boy. (Bitsy walks away)"
Mike	 Awesome!'
Chandler	 I'm not gonna watch it... I don't NEED to watch \n  it... I mean, what good could possibly come from watching? (sighs) Well, we \n  know I'm gonna watch it. (Chandler moves to put the tape in the VCR and Joey \n  enters the apartment)"
Joey	 Hey dude, what's up?"
Chandler	 Don't judge me, I'm only human!"
Joey	 Did you take that tape?'
Chandler	 I had to! Okay, imagine you were married... and \n  you found a tape of your wife in another guys' apartment... Wouldn't you need \n  to know what was on it?"
Joey	 I don't know. Who'm I'm married to?"
Chandler	 Some girl...!?'
Joey	 She hot?'
Chandler	 Yeah...!?'
Joey	 How did she get me to settle down?'
Chandler	 Allright, I'm gonna watch it... I mean look, it's \n  probably not even what I think it is... And even if it is... It can't possibly \n  be as bad as what I'm picturing in my head... (laughs nervously) Can it?"
Joey	 Guess I don't know. My experience
Chandler	 Then you're gonna have to watch it for me."
Joey	 (backs off) What? Whoo... What?'
Chandler	 Just for a few seconds, so I can know what it is... \n  Please?'
Joey	 All right, fine... But if I enjoy this, you have only \n  yourself to blame... (Chandler turns his back to the TV. Joey puts the tape \n  in the VCR, switches it on and watches what's on the tape... It's clearly a \n  american football match, with the referee's whistle blowing, the crowds cheering...)"
Chandler	 Why am I hearing cheering?'
Joey	 Well it's okay, its like... its just a football game."
Chandler	 Football? Just football?'
Joey	 Yeah, see... you were all worried for nothing.'
Chandler	 It's football... It's just football... This is great! \n  This is the first time I've ever enjoyed football... It may be customary to \n  get a beer... (Chandler walks to the fridge, his back turned to the TV and a \n  moaning sound replaces the cheering of the crowd... Joey's eyes double in size...) \n  What the... (Chandler turns around, but Joey already took a sprint for Chandler, \n  jumps, and floors Chandler in the open space in front of the apartment door...) \n  What are you doing?"
Joey	 You don't wanna see what I just saw! (at this moment \n  Monica comes home, and sees Chandler flat on his back on the floor and Joey \n  pinning him down)"
Monica	 What are you guys doing? (Monica hears the moaning \n  coming from the TV and looks at it) Oh my God, is that Richard? (It only takes \n  a split second for Joey to realise, he pulls Monica down by her jacket, and \n  she falls, face down next to Chandler. Chandler gets up a bit, and Joey quickly \n  covers Chandler's eyes with his hand.)"
Rachel	 Okay... aahhh... Please laugh for mommy... Please? \n  Please laugh for mommy... (Rachel makes a funny face, sticking her tongue out, \n  making a farting noise and using her hands as antlers, wiggling her fingers... \n  No response from Emma...) Not funny huh? Oh so, is it... only offensive novelty \n  rap? Or maybe just, you know, rap in general? \'Cause mommy can rap... (Rachel \n  tries to rap and makes weird movements with her arms in the process.) My \n  name is mommy and I\'m here to say / that all the babies are... Oh, I can\'t \n  rap... Allright sweetheart... This is only because I love you so much, and I \n  know that you\'re not gonna tell anybody... (Rachel\'s face is telling "Oh \n  what am I doing? The things I have to go through... and she starts to rap) I \n  like... big butts and I cannot lie... / You other brothers can\'t deny... / when \n  a girl walks in with an itty bitty waist and a round thing in your face... (Emma \n  starts to laugh) Yes! Yes! Yes! YES! Oohhhhh! Oh! (Rachel now really gets into \n  it, and her insecure movements start getting better) I like big butts and \n  I cannot lie... / You other brothers can\'t deny... Oh Emma you\'re laughing! \n  Oh you are, you really do like big butts, don\'t you. Oh you beautiful little \n  weirdo... (Rachel picks up Emma and Ross now enters)'
Ross	 Hey!'
Rachel	 Oh you missed it. She was laughing. Oh it was amazing. \n  It was amazing. It was the most beautiful, beautiful sound that...'
Ross	 Oh I know, isn't it? Ooh... what'd you do to get her \n  to laugh?"
Rachel	 Oh! You know, I just... couple of things I tried ... \n  I just sang a little doo... Itsy Bitsy Spider...'
Ross	 You sang Baby Got Back didn't you?"
Rachel	 Nothing else worked. That girl is all about the ass...'
Phoebe	 ...and then it goes back to the chorus... Smelly \n  cat, Sme-lly ca-t / I-t's not your fau-lt. And that's the end of the song... \n  I realise that you didn't ask to hear it, but uhm... no-one had spoken in seventeen \n  minutes."
Mike	 Phoebe writes lots of great songs. Wha... What was that \n  one you sang the other night that everybody just loved?'
Phoebe	 Oh, Pervert Parade?'
Mike	 (sighs) No...'
Phoebe	 Oh, Ode To A Pubic Hair?'
Mike	 Stop! (The butler serves dinner)'
Phoebe	 Oh God! Is that veal?'
Mike	 Mom, I thought I told you... Phoebe's a vegetarian."
Bitsy	 Oh!'
Phoebe	 Oh no, no, no, no... That's okay, that's okay... I \n  mean, I'm... I am a vegetarian... except for veal... Yeah no, veal I love..."
Mike	 Phoebe you don't have to eat..."
Phoebe	 No, no, no, I actually it's any baby animals
Mike	 So...? What do you think? (looks at his parents, which \n  look in disgust)'
Monica	 So you stole that tape from Richard's apartment?"
Chandler	 Whoho ho... Listen to the judgement from the porn \n  star!'
Monica	 That tape was never meant to be seen by... (pauses) \n  Joey I would feel more comfortable if I was having this conversation in private. \n'
Joey	 (laughs) Monica, look... I don't think you and I have \n  any secrets anymore... (Monica keeps looking at Joey) Not ready to joke about \n  it yet, okay, I see you later. (Joey walks out)"
Monica	 Why in the world would you take this tape and and \n  why would you watch it?'
Chandler	 Because that's who I am, okay? I'm sure a mature \n  man like Richard could see a tape like that and it wouldn't bother him. Just'd \n  be another saucy anecdote for him to share at his men's club over brandy and \n  moustaches."
Monica	 Is all this about you not being able to grow a moustache?'
Chandler	 This is about you and Richard. He's clearly not \n  over you. He keeps a tape so he can... look at it whenever he wants."
Monica	 Isn't that sad? I mean, can you see how pathetic that \n  is? You shouldn't be jealous. You should feel bad for him."
Chandler	 Oh, yeah, well, poor Richard. Y'... I can grow a \n  moustache!"
Monica	 Chandler, this is not our problem. We've got each \n  other. That's all that matters."
Chandler	 Yeah, oh, but I just keep picturing you rolling \n  around with him with your cowboy boots in the air...'
Monica	 Cowboy boots? I've never worn cowboy boots in my whole \n  life! (she turns on the video again)"
Chandler	 Oh, good, good. Play more, 'cause I wanna see how \n  it ends."
Monica	 THAT'S NOT ME!"
Chandler	 What...? That's not you! Life is good again! Ride \n  'em cowgirl!"
Monica	 That bastard taped over me! (Chandler's expression \n  changes)"
Chandler	 Is that a problem? '
Monica	 I-It's just so insulting! Big spring for a new blank \n  tape, Doctor!"
Theodore	 I can't imagine what he sees in her."
Bitsy	 She actually makes me miss that pill-popping ex-wife \n  of his. (Mike walks in) Oh, hello dear...'
Mike	 Hey, what's going on?"
Bitsy	 We were just chit-chatting. How's your friend?"
Mike	 A little better.'
Bitsy	 By the way, do you know who's moving back into town? \n  Tom and Sue's daughter Jen."
Theodore	 You remember her Michael, she's lovely and... well \n  behaved and... single."
Mike	 I'm not interested."
Bitsy	 Oh, please darling, let's be honest. You can have all \n  the... sailor fun you want with that one, but... let's be real..."
Mike	 All right, stop! You know, all Phoebe has done tonight \n  is trying to get you to like her. And maybe that hasn't been clear all the time, \n  but she did her best. And yeah... She's a little different than you are..."
Bitsy	 Michael, a pimp spit in her mouth! (Phoebe almost enters \n  the room, but she hears the discussion and waits and evesdrops next to the door-opening.)'
Mike	 So what? I mean if even I can get past that, it shouldn't \n  bother you. And you don't have to like her. You just have to accept \n  the fact that I do. I mean, if you even can't be civil to the woman I love..."
Bitsy	 The woman you what? (Phoebe overheard what Michael \n  said and now enters the room)'
Phoebe	 Yeah... The woman you what?'
Mike	 The woman I love... (he walks to Phoebe) I love you... \n  Which is probably something I shouldn't say for the first time in front of my \n  parents... and Tom and Sue...Who are by the way the most sinfully boring I've \n  ever met in my life..."
Phoebe	 I love you too... '
Mike	 You do?'
Phoebe	 YEAH...! How great is this...? (they kiss)'
Mike	 Wanna get out of here?'
Phoebe	 Okay.'
Mike	 Mom, dad, thanks for dinner.'
Phoebe	 I had a great time. (accent) It was really top drawer. \n  And here's something rich

Ross	 She sweat, wet. got it going like a turbo 'vette."
Rachel	 So fellas'
Ross	 Yeah!'
Rachel	 fellas'
Ross	 Yeah!'
Rachel	 has your girlfriend got the butt?'
Ross	 Hell yeah!'
Rachel	 So shake it! (Rachel slaps Ross's butt on \n  the beat)"
Ross	 Shake it!'
Rachel	 Shake it!  (Phoebe, Mike, Chandler, Monica \n  and Joey step in)'
Ross	 Shake it!'
Rachel	 Shake that nasty butt...'
Ross	 Baby got back (Then Ross turns around and sees \n  their friends standing in the doorway)'
Rachel	 One more time from the top... I like big butts \n  and I cannot lie, you other br... (She also turns and sees the gang)'
Ross	 Rachel please! That is so inappropriate!'
