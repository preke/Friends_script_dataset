\nChandler	  Hi!'
Ross	 Hey!'
Monica	 Hey!'
Chandler	 We're just here to say goodbye, we're off to Ohio."
Phoebe	 Oh, right! Your adoption interview!'
Monica	 Yep, we're gonna meet the lady who could be carrying our baby."
Joey	 I can't believe it. When you guys come back, you're gonna have a baby! That is so weird!"
Chandler	 And so incorrect!'
Monica	 She's only a couple of months pregnant. She liked our application but who knows if she's gonna like us."
Ross	 Come on, she's gonna love you guys!"
Chandler	 Uhm, thank you, but we're really trying not to get our hopes up."
Monica	 And a lot could still get in our way.'
Chandler	 Yeah. I mean, this girl could decide against adoption or she could like another couple better..'
Phoebe	 What are you gonna name the baby?'
Chandler	 I can develop a condition in which I talk and talk and no one hears a word.'
Joey	 But just think, ok? What if everything goes right? What if this woman does pick you guys?'
Monica	 Oh my God. She's gonna pick us!"
Chandler	 So we're standing firm on the 'not getting our hopes up'?"
Monica	 You know, I know that things could still go wrong but if they don't? If this works out, we're gonna have a baby Chandler, a baby!"
Chandler	 Yes, but...'
Monica	 Oh my God, it's gonna WORK! We're gonna make it work! I'm gonna be a mummy and (to Chandler) you're gonna be a daddy! All right, I'll see you suckers. I'm gonna get me... A BABY! {she leaves)"
Chandler	 Oh, screw it, I'm gonna be a daddy!!"

Rachel	 (to Joey) Hey, who's Phoebe with?"
Joey	 I'm gonna say someone I'm gonna have sex with. (the girl leaves and Phoebe goes toward the couch) (to Phoebe) Hey!"
Phoebe	 Hey!'
Joey	 So... who's your friend?"
Phoebe	 Oh, that's Sarah. No, no. Don't you get any ideas, ok? No, I'm not setting you up with any more of my friends!"
Joey	 OW, why, why, why?'
Phoebe	 Because you'll date her once, sleep with her and then forget she exists!"
Joey	 Oh, name one friend of yours that I did that with.'
Phoebe	 Mandy.'
Joey	 Mandy, uh? Uh... really hot blonde, big boobs?'
Phoebe	 No.'
Joey	 I know why I don't remember her, huh? (he winks at Rachel)"
Rachel	 Do you think I'm someone else?"
Joey	 Ok, I may not have treated your friends well in the past, but I have grown up a lot, really. Honest, Rach?'
Rachel	 Well, believe it or not, it's true. When Joey and I were together, he was wonderful. He was thoughtful and mature. And for the one week that we went out, he didn't sleep with anybody else!"
Joey	 (pointing at himself) Growth!'
Phoebe	 Fine, I'll give you her number."
Joey	 Ok, thank you. And I promise you I will not forget this one. (he starts writing on his hand) Mandy.'
Phoebe	 SARAH!'
Joey	 Saraaah.'
Ross	 (entering) Hey!'
Rachel	 Hi!'
Ross	 Hey you guys, I need some fashion advice.'
Rachel	 Oh!'
Ross	 (he takes a baby blue beret out of a shopping box and puts it on) How does this look?'
Rachel	 Well, it's a little low... pick up a little... (Ross picks it up) a little bit more... (he picks it up again) a little bit more... (he takes it off) There you go! (pause) Now throw it away!"
Ross	 C'mon! This looks good!"
Rachel	 Ross, please, trust me. I buy 30 fashion magazines a month. Now, I don't know who's running for president or who that... NATO guy is, but I do know that you have to get as far away as you can from that hat."
Ross	 Damnit! I have this date tomorrow night and I have to look cool!'
Phoebe	 Well, you know, if you want fashion help, Rachel and I are going shopping tomorrow. You're more than welcome to come with us, right?"
Ross	 Really? That would be great. I mean, I have to do something, she kinda teased me about how I dress. '
Joey	 I can see why, nice shirt!'
Ross	 You're wearing the same shirt."
Joey	 Stupid Gap on every corner!\n'
\nAgency guy	 Please, make yourself comfortable and I will back in a moment with Erica.'
Monica	 Ok, thank you.(the man leaves) Uh, well this is it. Are you OK?'
Chandler	 Yeah. Just weird, you know. It\'s like
Monica	 Uh, we're gonna be great."
Chandler	 You're gonna be great."
Monica	 Well... obviously!'
Agency guy	 (he enters with Erica) Monica, Chandler. I'd like you to meet Erica."
Monica	 Hi. It is so, so nice to meet you.'
Erica	 (whispering) Hi...'
Chandler	 Thank you so much for agreeing to see us.'
Erica	 Hi.'
Agency guy	 I'll let you get acquainted."
Chandler	 Ok.'
Erica	 So, it's Monica and Chandler. I only know you as file 0W33815-D."
Chandler	 That's what our friends call us."
Erica	 Gosh, you know, you're just such an amazing couple. It's... kind of intimidating."
Monica	 I don't know about that."
Erica	 You're kidding me? I mean, it's enough that you are a doctor. But on top of it, you're married to a reverend?"
Chandler	 (astonished) I don't think that's exactly..."
Monica	 (overlapping) Let her finish, doctor.'
\nPhoebe	 Hey!\n'
Joey	 Hey.'
Phoebe	 Oh, my friend Sarah had a great time last night.'
Joey	 Well...'
Phoebe	 Yeah! So you're gonna call this one back?"
Joey	 Nope.'
Phoebe	 What are you talking about? Sarah's great!"
Joey	 Oh, really? You know what your great friend did? We're out to dinner, ok? (he starts talking about the date and we can see what happened through a flashback video) We're getting along, having a really nice time. I was thinking she was really cool. And then, out of nowhere... "
Phoebe	 That\xe2\x80\x99s it? That\xe2\x80\x99s why you won\xe2\x80\x99t go out with her again? So, she took some fries, big deal!'
Joey	 Hey, hey, look! It\xe2\x80\x99s not about a few fries... it\xe2\x80\x99s about what the fries represent.'
Phoebe	 What?'
Joey	 ALL FOOD!'
Phoebe	 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, I can\xe2\x80\x99t believe I set you up with such a MONSTER!'
Joey	 Hey, hey, hey, hey. Look. I take a girl out, she can order whatever she wants! The more, the better! All right? Just don\xe2\x80\x99t order a Garden salad and then eat my food! That\xe2\x80\x99s a good way to lose some fingers!'
Phoebe	 (to Rachel) Oh'
Rachel	 Hi'
Phoebe	 Thank God you\xe2\x80\x99re here. Listen to this!'
Rachel	 what?'
Phoebe	 Joey and my friend were out last night and having dinner and she reaches over and takes a few of his fries...'
Rachel	 Oh! Oh, no!'
Phoebe	 What? You know about the plate thing?'
Rachel	 Oh, yeah. Joey doesn\xe2\x80\x99t share food. I mean, just last week we were having breakfast and he had a couple of grapes on his plate and ...'
Phoebe	 (to Joey) You wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t let her have a grape?'
Rachel	 Oh no! Not me! Emma!'
Joey	 (mad and pointing a finger to himself) JOEY DOESN\xe2\x80\x99T SHARE FOOD!'
Phoebe	 Well, I still think that it\xe2\x80\x99s a stupid reason not to call someone again. You are calling her! And if you need to, just get an extra plate of fries for the table!'
Joey	 (he thinks a little, considering the option and seems to be quite satisfied) I like that! A sharing buffer! Yeah! I\xe2\x80\x99ll order some extra fries! Maybe a plate of onion rings. Yeah. And a shrimp cocktail. And some buffalo wings. Maybe an individual pizza, uh? And some mozzarella sticks. (he looks absorbed in his food thoughts) What were we talking about?'
\nPhoebe	 (to Ross) This place is awesome!\n'
Ross	 You know, we should just go, I\xe2\x80\x99m not gonna find anything here! This stuff is ridiculous! '
Rachel	 Ah, this place is great!'
Phoebe	 Wow!'
Ross	 Rach, come on, I\xe2\x80\x99m not gonna wear any of this! (he picks up a shirt) Nothing silver. (Rachel sighs). Ok? Nothing with hair! (Rachel sighs again) And nothing with padlocks on it! (Rachel heaves a long disappointing sigh).'
Rachel	 Ross, look, I know that some of this stuff is out there, but I mean, come on, look at this, look at this sweater! (she picks up a blue sweater). I mean, this is just beautiful!'
Ross	 (feeling the fabric) Wow, this is really soft (he looks the price). Three hundred and fifty dollars?'
Rachel	 Yeah, down from seven hundred, you are saving like two hundred bucks!'
Ross	 Both logic and math are taking a serious hit today.'
Ross	 Wow!'
Phoebe	 Yeah!'
Ross	 Actually this looks like pretty good! Yeah!(he turns and watches his back and there\xe2\x80\x99s a sign on the back of the jacket, \xe2\x80\x9cboys will be boys\xe2\x80\x9d) Boys will be boys?'
Phoebe	 What? They will be!'
Ross	 All right, that\xe2\x80\x99s it, I\xe2\x80\x99m getting out of here.'
Rachel	 No, no, no, no! Ross, wait! Come on! You know, there\xe2\x80\x99s other stuff. Here\xe2\x80\x99s a nice shirt, look at these nice pants...'
Ross	 Uh, actually these might look pretty good on me.'
Rachel	 Yes, they will! You know what you should do? Just go take a walk, all right? I know your size and I\xe2\x80\x99m... I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna pick up some really good stuff for you.'
Ross	 Really?'
Rachel	 Yes! And I know what looks sexy on guys. Please, just wear what I suggest, and she\xe2\x80\x99s gonna go nuts for you.'
Ross	 So, you\xe2\x80\x99re saying, uh, if I wear these pants I might be getting into hers?'
Rachel	 (to Phoebe) Why do men keep talking to me like this?'
Chandler	 So, the fact that I am a doctor, and my wife\xe2\x80\x99s a reverend, that\xe2\x80\x99s important to you?'
Erica	 Yeah, I read some great applications, but then I thought \xe2\x80\x9cwho better then a minister to raise a child!\xe2\x80\x9d'
Monica	 Amen.'
Chandler	 Plus I thought the baby would be in good hands with a doctor!'
Monica	 Uh, good hands. (she holds Chandler hands) Healing hands.'
Erica	 Reverend, can I ask? Does the bible say anything about adoption?'
Monica	 It says \xe2\x80\x9cDo it!\xe2\x80\x9d. And behold she did adopt onto them a baby. And it was good.'
Erica	 Wow.'
Chandler	 Yeah, wow.'
Erica	 I was wondering you both have such serious jobs. (to Monica) Would you have time to take care of a baby and your flock?'
Monica	 Oh, you know, my flock is good, I mean, yeah, my flock pretty much takes care of themselves at this point. Good flock. Flock, flock, flock.'
Erica	 (to Chandler) Being a doctor must take up a lot of time.'
Chandler	 No-ot for me it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t.'
Agency guy	 So, how\xe2\x80\x99s everything going in here?'
Erica	 We\xe2\x80\x99re great, I think I may have asked all my questions.'
Agency guy	 Do you have any question for Erica?'
Chandler	 Yeah, actually. So, you read a file that you liked and you gave the agency the serial number and they contacted us?'
Agency guy	 Yes, our system assures total anonimity. We\xe2\x80\x99re very proud of it.'
Chandler	 You should be. You\xe2\x80\x99re really on top of stuff..'
Agency guy	 (to Erica) Well, then if there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing else, then the two of us should talk.'
Erica	 Actually, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think we have to.'
Monica	 We don\xe2\x80\x99t?'
Erica	 Yeah, when I read about you two, I was pretty sure I wanted you, but I just thought we should meet face to face. (to the agency guy). I've made my decision. I choose them."
Monica	 Oh my God, this is great! This is so great! (to Chandler, who looks bewildered). Did you hear that?'
Chandler	 Yeah, I did.'
Monica	 (to Erica) Hey, thank you. Thank you so much. (they hugs). You are SO going to Heaven!'
\nRachel	 We got some really great stuff!'
Phoebe	 Yeah, yeah but I am not sure about some of the bra's I got."
Rachel	 Oh! Really? Do you wanna try some of them on for me? '
Phoebe	 Oh! okay. Wait, are we in Joey's imagination?"
Rachel	 (looking into one of her shopping bags) Oh no! I took one of Ross' bags by  \n  mistake, and one of mine is missing."
Phoebe	 oh, well, Ross probably has it, you can get it from him later.'
Ross	 (to Joey) So? What do you think? (Shows himself - Joey observes him with a strange look on his face.)'
Joey	 I think were not wearing the same shirt anymore!!'
Ross	 (not getting it) Yeah! Yeah! Rachel picked it out for me. She told me to trust her and you know what? I'm glad I did! I turned quite a few heads on my way over here."
Joey	 (now laughing a little) Dude, I really don't think you should be wearing that."
Ross	 Oh, I see, somebody is afraid of a little competition with the ladies?'
Joey	 (looking a little agitated now) Looks like someone IS the ladies!!'
Ross	 You're just jealous because you couldn't pull this off. Yeah, now if you'll excuse me (getting up and taking his coat) I have a date. (As he is walking out, everyone turns and stares at him) See? (To Joey) ALL eyes on ME!"
Chandler	 We are NOT signing those papers.'
Monica	 Why not?'
Chandler	 It's wrong. They made a mistake. They think we're somebody else."
Monica	 God works in mysterious ways.'
Chandler	 You have gotta stop!'
Monica	 But she liked us.'
Chandler	 She likes Doctor Chandler and Reverend Monica.'
Monica	 Well, if you think about it, I am kind of like a Reverend. I mean, as a chef, I serve God, by feeing the hungry and poor. (looks very convinced about what she just said)'
Chandler	 Your Veal Chop is $34,95!'
Monica	 C'mon Chandler, I think we have been given an opportunity. I mean, the mistake has already been made. They are writing up the paper right now."
Chandler	 But we are not the one she chose! How can you feel okay about this?'
Monica	 (very emotional) Because... We may not be who she thinks we are but no-one will ever love that baby more than us.'
Chandler	 I know..'
Monica	 I mean, who knows how long it's gonna take for someone else to give us a baby? What if, what if no one ever picks us?"
Chandler	 oh, honey..'
Monica	 (Almost crying) Please.. please, we are so close.'
Chandler	 Monica, I want a baby too, but this woman is giving away her child. She deserves to know who it's going to. \n\nMonica
Chandler	 So, we'll tell the truth and who knows, maybe she'll like us for us."
Monica	 (sniffing) Maybe she will. Uh! Why couldn't I have been a Reverend?"
Chandler	 You're Jewish."
Monica	 Technicality!'
Waiter	 A garden salad for the lady (sets the plate down)'
Joey	 Oh, that looks great! Good ordering!'
Waiter	 Seafood platter for the gentleman and extra fries. Enjoy!'
Sarah	 Mmmh, those fries look delicious.'
Joey	 oh, I didn't know you liked French fries. Help yourself! What's mine is yours. (Sarah reaches over and takes a few fries)"
Sarah	 (looks over at Joey's platter) Oh wow, are those stuffed clams?"
Joey	 Uuuh.. yes, they are my stuffed clams.'
Joey	 How about those fries though, huh? (Holds the plate between Sarah\xe2\x80\x99s fingers and his plate, thus blocking her from reaching his)'
Sarah	 They are delicious (takes a few from the plate, puts one in her mouth and places the rest on her plate, then starts to reach over to Joey's platter again)"
Joey	 (Spotting her movements takes her hand into his own) You are beautiful, you know that?'
Sarah	 Oh, that is so sweet..'
Joey	 Oh (grinning, trying to hold in his impatience with her) okay.. (she takes her hand back)'
Joey	 (Visibly annoyed) NOW look what you did!!'
Sarah	 What? what is the matter with you?'
Joey	 I don't like it when people take food off of my plate, okay?"
Sarah	 But you just said "What\'s mine is yours"?'
Joey	 WELL, I DIDN'T MEAN IT!"
Sarah	 Fine, I'm sorry, I didn't think it was that big a deal."
Joey	 I'm sorry, I'm overreacting. Okay, It's just when it comes to food, I have certain rules, okay, I mean (bends down and with his plate and his hands, scrapes the dropped dinner back onto the plate and puts it back on the table) There are things you do..and you now, things.. (takes something from the plate and blows it a little) that you don't do (He takes a bite from it). "
Girl	 Wow, this place looks great.'
Ross	 Oh! You are gonna love it! (The girl is looking in the other direction as Ross is taking off his own coat, revealing the pink and white ladies shirt) and I'm so glad, we're finally doing this."
Girl	 Me too! (starts to take her coat off)'
Ross	 Here (gets behind her to help. When the coat comes off we see she is wearing the exact same shirt Ross is wearing. They look at each other, shocked. They abruptly put their coat back on) So this was fun! (They leave the room and head into opposite directions)'
Joey	 I really am sorry about, you know..before. I just want to make sure you know that I really do like you.'
Sarah	 Sure (smiling) Just not as much as clams.'
Joey	 (Jokingly) Well, stuffed clams.'
Waiter	 Chocolate Torte for the lady, cheesecake for the gentleman.'
Joey	 Uh, excuse me sir, there seems to be some sort of red crap on my cheesecake.'
Waiter	 Yes, that's Raspberry coule."
Joey	 (More to himself than anyone else) So stupid, ordering cheesecake, trying to  \n  be healthy. (pushes it aside)'
Sarah	 (tasting hers) Oh my God! (Looks at the waiter and then to Joey)'
Joey	 Oh, all right, I'll just have what she's having instead."
Waiter	 Oh, I'm sorry sir, that was our last piece."
Sarah	 Mmmm! Mmm!'
Sarah	 Oh, no! This is work. I should call in. Can you excuse me?'
Joey	 Oh yeah, sure. No problem.'
Sarah	 What are you doing? I thought you don't share food."
Joey	 Sure I do. (holding up his own dessert) Coule?'
Sarah	 (laughing) No. If I can't have your clams, you can't have my dessert. This is a two way street."
Joey	 (laughing) Really?'
Sarah	 Really! Now this all better be here when I come back. (puts her plate back at her side of the table)'
Joey	 Yeah, of course. I can control myself. (laughs uneasily and Sarah leaves the room)'
Joey	 (to the torte) Stop staring at me!'
Joey	 Why, just a tiny little...'
Joey	 Oh-oh!'
Joey	 I'm not even sorry."
Erica	 Hi!'
Adoption Agency guy	 Hey.'
Chandler	 Hey.'
Agency guy	 So, these are the preliminary forms for an open adoption. There's a lot to go over, but I'll explain everything as we go through it."
Monica	 (pointing to a picture on the table) I-Is... Is that a picture?'
Erica	 Yeah. It's a sonogram they took of the baby last week. I thought you might want to see it. (gives it to Monica, who looks at it for a long time, and then shows it to Chandler)"
Monica	 Look, doctor!'
Agency guy	 I don't understand."
Chandler	 The agency must have made some mistake. My wife is not a reverend and I'm not a doctor."
Erica	 What?'
Agency guy	 That's impossible."
Chandler	 I could perform an operation on you and prove it if you'd like."
Agency guy	 I'll go check your file. Excuse me."
Erica	 So who are you?'
Chandler	 Well, our names really are Monica and Chandler. We're from New York."
Monica	 Yeah, but the important thing to know about us, is how much we would care for this little baby. (holds up the sonogram)'
Erica	 So you lied to me before?'
Monica	 Well, we... (makes quotation signs in the air) "bore false witness"... See I could be a reverend.'
Erica	 I can't believe this. "
Monica	 But we were hoping that since we told you the truth that you still might consider...'
Erica	 Giving you my baby? You think I'd give you my child after this?"
Monica	 Well, you don't have to decide right now, but if you could just look at our file..."
Erica	 I don't want to look at your file! This is over."
Chandler	 Erica wait!'
Erica	 I've nothing to say to you. (walks a few paces)"
Chandler	 You have every reason to be upset. We did lie. But only because we've been waiting and trying to have a baby for so long. Now we don't know how long it's gonna be before we can get another chance again."
Erica	 Why don't you ask the reverend to pray on it?"
Chandler	 Erica, please. Just consider us. Ask them to see our file. Our last name's Bing. My wife's a chef and I'm in advertising."
Erica	 Oh yeah. I actually liked you guys. But it doesn't matter, because what you did was wrong. (walks away again, but Chandler catches up with her again)"
Chandler	 But you did like us. And you should. My wife's an incredible woman. She's loving and devoted and caring. And don't tell her I said this but the woman's always right... I love my wife more than anything in this world. And I... It kills me that I can't give her a baby... I really want a kid. And when that day finally comes, I'll learn how to be a good dad. But my wife... she's already there. She's a mother... without a baby... Please?"
Chandler	 You still want that baby?'
Monica	 God bless you Chandler Bing!'

Ross	 Turns out this sweater is made for a woman.'
Joey	 (nods) So, why are you still wearing it?'
Ross	 Because it's soft... Hey, so how was your date?"
Joey	 Ooh... Not so good.'
Ross	 Well, looks like it's just the two of us tonight, huh old buddy?"
Joey	 Yeah, and you know what? We could do a lot worse.'
Joey	 (shouting to Ross) JOEY DOESN'T SHARE FOOD!"
