Phoebe	 (holding a lure) So now, what is this now?'
Joey	 Guggly worm.'
Phoebe	 (laughs and picks up another lure) And this?'
Joey	 Glow-pop giggly jammer.'
Phoebe	 (laughs harder) You make it so funny.'
Monica	 (not wanting to be left out, picks up something) Hey umm, what\xc2\x92s\nthis?'
Joey	 (examining it) Ohh, a hunk of sandwich from last year. (Monica drops the\nsandwich)'
Ross	 (pretend fishing in the living room) Ohh, Geller\xc2\x92s got one hooked!\nOhh! Looks like a big one! Yeah, ohh! Ohh! (Swinging the rod back and forth) It\xc2\x92s the\nclassic struggle between man and\xc2\x97(swings the rod and knocks over a lamp.) Someone\nknocked over a lamp.'
Joey	 (going over and picking up the rod) That\xc2\x92s all right. Hey you guys,\nyou know what\xc2\x92s going to be great about the fishing trip this year? When my dad gets\nme out in the middle of the lake and gives me that, "Joey, what are you doing with\nyour life?" stuff. I can say, "Well, I\xc2\x92m doing a movie with Charlton Heston\ndad. What are you doing with your life?"'
All	 Great!'
Chandler	 You don\xc2\x92t have to stop having fun just because I\xc2\x92m here.\nKathy didn\xc2\x92t cheat on all of you. (To Joey) Well, except you. (They hug and Chandler\ngoes into the bathroom with the chick and duck following him.)'
Monica	 Hey, Joey, I don\xc2\x92t think that you should leave Chandler alone. I\nmean it\xc2\x92s only been two days since he broke up with Kathy. Maybe you can go fishing\nnext week?'
Joey	 Look, there\xc2\x92s nothing I can do for him right now, he\xc2\x92s still in\nhis sweat pants, that\xc2\x92s still Phase One. Y'know? I\xc2\x92ll be back for Phase Two, I\nwould never miss Phase Two."
Monica	 What\xc2\x92s Phase Two?'
Joey	 Gettin\xc2\x92 drunk and going to a strip club. '
Rachel	 How does going to a strip club help him better?'
Ross	 Because there are naked ladies there.'
Joey	 Which helps him get to Phase Three, picturing yourself with other women.'
Ross	 There are naked ladies there too.'
Joey	 Yeah.'
Chandler	 (opening the bathroom door and kicking out the chick and duck) Would\nyou give me one minute!! Please.'

Joshua	 So, these will match the jacket you picked out for me last week?'
Rachel	 Um-hmm. (Joshua turns to look in the mirror and leaves Rachel staring at\nhis ass.) There we go. There it is.'
Joshua	 (turning around) Oh! You know what I need? '
Rachel	 Yeah!'
Joshua	 Gloves. Brown, leather dress gloves.'
Rachel	 Oh, okay. Uhh, well let\xc2\x92s see. (Grabs his hand.) You\xc2\x92re\nabout\xc2\x97well uh, this one is large. And this one\xc2\x97(Grabs the other hand.)'
Joshua	 Also large?'
Rachel	 Yeah! Okay, two larges coming right up!'
Joshua	 Okay.'

Rachel	 Yes.'
Mr. Waltham	 I-I was wondering, my niece you see is in from London\xc2\x97well\nShropshire really but y\xc2\x92know\xc2\x97well she\xc2\x92s about your age I say. Anyway I have\ntickets for the opera, Die Fledermaus, and I was wondering if you\xc2\x92d like to keep her\ncompany this evening?'

Rachel	 Me, Fledermaus, great. I really\xc2\x97(motions to Joshua.)'
Mr. Waltham	 Ohh! Yes of course, thank you, thank you, thank you so very much.'
Joshua	 So\xc2\x85(Holds out his hands as to say, "Where are my\ngloves?")'
Rachel	 So? (She puts her hands in his, totally forgetting about the gloves, and\nhoping for something more intimate.)'
Joshua	 Gloves?'
Rachel	 Ohh! Right! Right, sorry, I\xc2\x92ll be right back!'
Joshua	 Uhh, actually y\xc2\x92know what, I kinda\xc2\x97I have to take off. '
Rachel	 Oh.'
Joshua	 But, I was curious; do you have any plans for tonight?'
Rachel	 No! Nothing!'
Joshua	 I invested in this night-club and it\xc2\x92s opening tonight, would you\nlike to come?'
Rachel	 Yeah! That would be great!'
Joshua	 You\xc2\x92re into hardcore S&M right?'
Rachel	 (shocked) Well, I-I guess\xc2\x97I\xc2\x85'
Joshua	 Kidding! (Rachel is relived) I\xc2\x92m gonna get there early, but\nI\xc2\x92m going to put you on the V.I.P list, okay? Look for me.'
Rachel	 Yeah, great, you betcha!'
Mr. Waltham	 (entering) I almost forget the tickets, didn\xc2\x92t I?'
Rachel	 What?'
Mr. Waltham	 For you and Emily, tonight, Die Fledermaus.'
Rachel	 Oh. Oh, right.'
Mr. Waltham	 I think you\xc2\x92ll like it, it has two out of the three tenors.'
Rachel	 Oh yay!'
Chandler	 Y\xc2\x92know, I can\xc2\x92t believe Kathy did this too me. I really,\nthought that she was the one. I tell you what, from now on I\xc2\x92m never getting out of\nthis chair, ever! Okay? From now on, this chair is the one! You wanna what else is the\none? My sweat pants!'
Ross	 Come on, man! Just-just take the sweats off. Okay? Just take \xc2\x91em off\nand we\xc2\x92ll have some fun.'
Joey	 (entering) Hey-hey!'
Ross	 Hi!'
Phoebe	 Hey!'
Ross	 Catch any big fish? (Phoebe, Ross, and Monica all go over to him.)'
Joey	 Oh my God, you guys have no idea. '
All	 (they all recoil from the smell emanating from him) Oh! God! Wow!'
Monica	 You stink!'
Ross	 Are you kidding?!'
Joey	 Yeah, three days on the lake without a shower. Plus! I fell in that big\ntub of worms at the bait stand! Hey, how-how\xc2\x92s he doing?'
Ross	 He hasn\xc2\x92t gotten out of that chair in two days.'
Joey	 (goes over to Chandler) Hey buddy! How\xc2\x92s it going?'
Joey	 (To the rest of the gang) Hey, see that? He just needed his pal to come\nhome. All right, uh, I\xc2\x92ve got to go memorise my lines. (Starts to go his bedroom) Me\nand Charlton Heston bright and early tomorrow morning! Yeah-yeah!'
Rachel	 (entering) Hey!'
Ross	 Hey!'
Rachel	 Hey, Monica!'
Monica	 Uh-oh, what\xc2\x92s the matter?'
Rachel	 Ohh, it\xc2\x92s Joshua invited me to this fancy club opening tonight.\nBut, I already told Mr. Waltham that I would take his niece to this dumb old opera.\nSo\xc2\x85 What are you gonna do?'
Monica	 I don\xc2\x92t know sweetie.'
Rachel	 No! Help me!'
Monica	 I can\xc2\x92t! I have to work!'
Rachel	 Phoebe?'
Phoebe	 I would, but I get my morning sickness in the evening. '
Rachel	 Ugh!'
Phoebe	 Unless! She wants to spend the night holding my hair back for me.'
Rachel	 Ohh, gosh. You guys, come on, this is\xc2\x97I have to meet Joshua! This\nis my one chance for him to see the fun Rachel. Y\xc2\x92know the "Wouldn\xc2\x92t it be\ngreat if she was my wife" Rachel. Ohh, all right! Are Joey and Chandler back?'
Monica	 No, Chandler\xc2\x92s still in Phase One, and Joey\xc2\x92s that thing you\nsmell.'
Rachel	 Ohh! (Realises that Ross is in the room.) Hi!'
Ross	 Hi!'
Rachel	 So\xc2\x85.'
Ross	 No.'
Rachel	 Ohhhh, come on!!!'
Monica	 I think she\xc2\x92s here.'
Rachel	 No! Wait! Wait-wait! Ross, please!'
Ross	 You want me to take some girl I\xc2\x92ve never met to the opera so you can\ngo to a club and flirt with some guy, hmm, that-that is a toughie.'
Monica	 (looking out the peephole) Ohh, she\xc2\x92s looking down the hall. Oh!\nShe looked right at me! Oh wait, you can\xc2\x92t see people through that little hole, can\nyou? (Goes back to the door.) Hello!'
Woman	 Hello! (Monica screams)'
Rachel	 I\xc2\x92ll be right there! (to Ross) Okay, Ross, please come on! I\nthought we have moved on! I thought we\xc2\x92ve gotten to a place where we could be happy\nfor each other! I mean was that just me?'
Ross	 All right, I\xc2\x92ll do it.'
Rachel	 Oh thank you! Thank you, thank you, thank you! (Monica opens the door.)\nEmily?'
Emily	 Yes.'
Rachel	 I\xc2\x92m Rachel Green.'
Emily	 Thank goodness.'
Rachel	 There\xc2\x92s been a teeny-teeny change in plans. It turns out that\nI\xc2\x92m not free tonight. So\xc2\x85'
Emily	 Really?! Well, that\xc2\x92s just lovely, isn\xc2\x92t it? I must\xc2\x92ve\nmissed your call, even though I didn\xc2\x92t leave the flat all day. '
Rachel	 Oh well, no I\xc2\x85'
Emily	 Oh, no-no-no, that\xc2\x92s not rude! It\xc2\x92s perfectly in keeping with a\ntrip that I\xc2\x92ve already been run down by one of your wiener carts, and been\nstrip-searched at John F. Kennedy Airport, apparently to you people, I look like someone\nwho\xc2\x92s got a balloon full of cocaine stuffed up their bum.'
Monica	 I-I-I think you look great.'
Emily	 Good night, it was very nice to meet you all. (Storms out.)'
Rachel	 I\xc2\x92ll get her.'
Ross	 Please hurry.'
Phoebe	 Don\xc2\x92t you just love the way they talk?!'
Phoebe	 Ohh!'
Monica	 What?'
Phoebe	 It kicked! I think the baby kicked!'
Monica	 Oh my God!'
Phoebe	 Oh no wait, oh no, the elastic on my underwear busted.'
Joey	 (running from his bedroom) Oh my God! I overslept! I was supposed to be on\nthe set a half an hour ago! I gotta get out of here!'
Monica	 Oh wait, Joey, you can\xc2\x92t go like that! You stink!'
Joey	 Look, I know I feel asleep before I could shower and now I don\xc2\x92t have\ntime! They\xc2\x92re just ten blocks away, if I run, I can make it.'
Monica	 Yeah. Run ten blocks, that\xc2\x92ll help the smell.'
Rachel	 Hey\xc2\x97whoa, slow down. (Gets a whiff of him) No, keep moving. (Joey\nruns off.) Wow!'
Monica	 So? How did it go with Joshua last night?'
Rachel	 Well, I didn\xc2\x92t see Joshua last night, but I did punch a girl\nin the face.'
Monica	 What?'
Phoebe	 Why?'
Rachel	 The whole night was horrible, it was pouring down rain, and when I got\nthere, there was no Rachel Green on the list, but there was a Rachel Greep.'
Phoebe	 Ohh! So, did you get to meet her?'
Rachel	 No, there is no Rachel Greep, but then this other girl overheard us and\nshe was all, "I\xc2\x92m Rachel Greep! I\xc2\x92m Rachel Greep!" and he let her\nright in. '
Monica	 So you hit her in the face?'
Rachel	 No, she was already in, but then this big bitch behind me tried to steal\nmy umbrella, so I clocked her. Ohhh! I can\xc2\x92t believe this, all I wanted was a few\nhours outside of work to see Joshua, so he can go ahead and start falling in love with me.'
Phoebe	 (going over to comfort her) Aww, Pheebs.'
Rachel	 Honey, that\xc2\x92s you\xc2\x92re name.'
Phoebe	 That\xc2\x92s short for Phoebe?! I thought that was just what we called\neach other!'
Monica	 Hey! You\xc2\x92re wearing pants!'
Chandler	 That\xc2\x92s right! Where are the guys? I\xc2\x92m ready to get drunk and\nsee some strippers.'
Monica	 It\xc2\x92s 9
Chandler	 They got a breakfast buffet.'
Monica	 Hello. (Listens) Oh, hey Ross!'
Chandler	 Ooh, let me talk to him!'
Monica	 Oh-oh, my God!'
Chandler	 Well, can I just\xc2\x85'
Monica	 (to Chandler) Shh!! (On phone) Wait, what?'
Chandler	 She\xc2\x92s shhing me! It\xc2\x92s my phone and she\xc2\x92s shhing me!'
Phoebe	 Shhh!! Please! What\xc2\x92s he saying?'
Monica	 He\xc2\x92s with Emily at a Bed and Breakfast in Vermont!'
Phoebe	 What? Oh my God!'
Rachel	 What? Who the hell is Emily\xc2\x97(realises) noooo!!'

Rachel	 They\xc2\x92re in Vermont!! How could this happen?! (She waves her arms\nfranticly and hits Chandler.)'
Chandler	 Ow!'
Rachel	 How\xc2\x97how did end up in Vermont with that awful witch?! (She hits\nChandler again.)'
Chandler	 Maybe, she doesn\xc2\x92t hit him all the time. '
Ross	 When we first met her, she was soaking, her feet were wet! Who\nwouldn\xc2\x92t be miserable? I\xc2\x92m telling you when I got her into a dry pair of shoes,\nshe was a totally different person.'
Emily	 (rushing in) Ross! Come quickly! There\xc2\x92s a deer just outside eating\nfruit from the orchard!'
Ross	 I\xc2\x92ve gotta go, there\xc2\x92s a deer just outside eating fruit from the\norchard! (He hangs up and runs out.)'
Monica	 He had to go, there\xc2\x92s a deer just outside eating fruit from the\norchard.'
Rachel	 I don\xc2\x92t get this! She was horrible! (She hits Chandler, yet again.)'
Chandler	 Okay, I\xc2\x92m going to go stand over there. (Points and moves into\nthe living room.)'
Monica	 Why do you care so much anyway?'
Rachel	 I don\xc2\x92t care! All right, y\xc2\x92know what I\xc2\x92m just upset that\nI\xc2\x92m getting nowhere with Joshua that\xc2\x97y\xc2\x92know what still, you do not meet\nsomeone and go flitting off to Vermont!'
Monica	 Well, when you first met Barry, you flitted off to Vail.'
Rachel	 Oh, y\xc2\x92know, would you just for once, not remember\nevery\xc2\x85little\xc2\x85thing!! (Storms out.)'
Chandler	 So y\xc2\x92know, uh, when\xc2\x92s he getting back?'
Monica	 A couple of days.'
Chandler	 Y\xc2\x92know, I knew something like this was going to happen. (He\nstarts to take off his pants, revealing that he is still wearing his sweat pants.)'
Monica	 What are you doing?! Chandler! You can\xc2\x92t just go back a phase!'
Chandler	 Yes you can. You\xc2\x92re thinking about time, you can\xc2\x92t go back\nin time.'
Phoebe	 Well, look, why don\xc2\x92t you just, why don\xc2\x92t you do your Phase\nTwo strip club thing with us.'
Monica	 Yeah, come on, we can be guys!'
Chandler	 (laughs) No you can\xc2\x92t.'
Phoebe	 Come on! Let us be guys! Maybe we want to be guys!'
Chandler	 You don\xc2\x92t want to be guys, you\xc2\x92d be all hairy and\nwouldn\xc2\x92t live as long. (Starts to go to his bedroom)'
Phoebe	 Y\xc2\x92know you, you just stop being such a wuss and get those off and\nyou come with us and watch naked girls dance around!!'
Chandler	 Okay. (Starts to cry)'
Phoebe	 I\xc2\x92m sorry. (Goes and hugs him)'
Joey	 (rushing in) Hey! Joey Tribbiani! I\xc2\x92m here! I\xc2\x92m here! '
The A.D	 Calm down, we got time, we\xc2\x92re running a little late.'
Joey	 Look at that, Charlton Heston eating a liquorice whip!'
The A.D	 Yeah, we loves \xc2\x91em. I\xc2\x92ve never seen him with\xc2\x97(He gets a\nwhiff of Joey and starts smelling around.)'
Joey	 (trying to act like he\xc2\x92s not the one that stinks.) Whoa! Yeah, what\nthe hell is that? What smells so bad?'
The A.D	 You.'
Joey	 Y\xc2\x92know, I can see why you think that, but ah, actually, you know who\nI think it is?'
The A.D	 You?'
Joey	 No-no, it\xc2\x92s uh, it\xc2\x92s Heston.'
The A.D	 What?'
Joey	 Yeah, the man wreaks! Smells like he went on a three day fishing trip and\nthen ate some liquorice. '
The A.D	 There\xc2\x92s no way he smells, he\xc2\x92s the only one around here with\na shower in his dressing room.'
Joey	 Really, a shower huh? And uh, which-which room might that be?'
The A.D	 The one with "Heston" on it.'
Joey	 Interesting.'
Monica	 (coming back to the stage and sitting next to Chandler) Okay, I\xc2\x92ve\ngot some Ones, you wanna put them in her panties?'
Chandler	 No thanks, Mom!'
Phoebe	 Oh, no umm, hi, that-that, you have to put that out, \xc2\x91cause\nI\xc2\x92m pregnant.'
The Cigarette Smoking Guy	 (No, not the Cigarette Smoking Man from The\nX-Files.) Well, maybe you and your baby should go to another strip club.'
Phoebe	 Ha-ha, it\xc2\x92s not my baby, ha-ha-ha! (He leaves.)'
Monica	 Very good, (getting up and sliding a One into the dancer\xc2\x92s hot\npants) so good.'
Phoebe	 (doing the same) I really, really enjoyed it. Very exotic.'
Rachel	 (joining them) Well, I just checked our messages and Joshua didn\xc2\x92t\ncall. I mean you\xc2\x92d think he\xc2\x92d be worried about me not showing up at his club.\nUgh, you know what makes it so much worse, Ross is all happy in Vermont!'
Phoebe	 Come on! Look where you are!!'
Monica	 (to the waitress) When you get a sec, another round of daiquiris.'
Phoebe	 Remember, a virgin for me please.'
Monica	 Oh! And don\xc2\x92t let me leave without getting the name of that carpet\nguy.'
Chandler	 Ahh, come on! Y\xc2\x92know what\xc2\x97y\xc2\x92know what, I think I\xc2\x92m\njust gonna go home and call Kathy.'
Phoebe	 Well, if you think it will help.'
Chandler	 No! That was a test! In a couple of hours I\xc2\x92m gonna get really\ndrunk and wanna call Kathy and you guys are gonna have to stop me! And then after that,\nI\xc2\x92m gonna get so drunk, I\xc2\x92m gonna wanna call Janice'
Phoebe	 You should! How is she?'
Chandler	 Ohhh!!'
Monica	 I think somebody needs another lap dance. (Motions for one.)'
Charlton Heston	 Hello! Who\xc2\x92s in there? (He opens to curtain to reveal a\nnaked and wet Joey.)'
Joey	 How ya doin\xc2\x92?'
Charlton Heston	 Who in the hell are you?'
Joey	 I guess you wouldn\xc2\x92t believe me if I said I was Kurt Douglas, huh?'
Charlton Heston	 Put some pants on kid so I can kick your butt.'
Joey	 No-no-no, no, no, wait. You see, I\xc2\x92m an actor, Joey Tribbiani,\nI\xc2\x92m doing a scene with you today, and well, I stink.'
Charlton Heston	 (shocked) You\xc2\x92re in this picture?'
Joey	 Yeah-yeah, I\xc2\x92m one of the cops that won\xc2\x92t work with you\n\xc2\x91cause you a lose cannon. Anyway, look, I\xc2\x92m really sorry, but I stink!'
Charlton Heston	 Joey, right?'
Joey	 Yeah.'
Charlton Heston	 (tosses him a towel, motions for him to get out of the shower\nand sits down on the couch) Every actor at one time or another\xc2\x97opp! (Joey tries to\nsit down next to him and Heston makes him sit somewhere else.) Every actor thinks he\nstinks, even Lawrence Oliver at sometimes thought he stank, Bob Redford won\xc2\x92t even\nwatch himself.'
Joey	 Oh no-no-no, you don\xc2\x92t understand\xc2\x85'
Charlton Heston	 Listen to me!'
Joey	 Oh yeah, yeah.'
Charlton Heston	 I don\xc2\x92t know one actor worth his salt that didn\xc2\x92t say\nat one time or another, "God, I stink!" Hell, I just did a scene out there,\nfirst take, I stunk the place up. But, the important thing you must remember, no matter\nhow badly you think you might stink, you must never, ever bust into my dressing room and\nuse my shower! Do you understand me?!'
Joey	 Yes sir! Yes sir, I\xc2\x92m-I\xc2\x92m\xc2\x97(he starts to leave)'
Charlton Heston	 Wait a minute! Take your pants.'
Joey	 Yeah. Oh, yeah.'
Monica	 So, we did okay at the strip club, right?'
Chandler	 Oh yeah, that was great. Thanks to you, the hottest cocktail waitress\nthere is quitting to teach the third grade!'
Rachel	 (entering) I can\xc2\x92t believe it! He still hasn\xc2\x92t called.'
Phoebe	 Who, Josh?'
Rachel	 It\xc2\x92s Joshua.'
Monica	 What, he doesn\xc2\x92t like Josh?'
Rachel	 No, I don\xc2\x92t.'
Chandler	 All right, well I\xc2\x92m gonna put my sweats back on.'
Phoebe	 Oh no! Wait! Wait! Okay, y\xc2\x92know what, you were right, you were\nright. We really weren\xc2\x92t great at being guys, but you know why? Because we\xc2\x92re\ngirls.'
Chandler	 Yeah?'
Phoebe	 And do you know what girls are really good at?'
Chandler	 Stripping!'
Phoebe	 No, listening! Sit! Y\xc2\x92know, maybe it would just really, really help\nif you would just talk.'
Rachel	 Yeah, come on! What\xc2\x92s going in on in there? (Pats his chest.)'
Monica	 Yeah. And y\xc2\x92know, if you wanna cry, that\xc2\x92s okay too.'
Chandler	 Okay, look, I\xc2\x92m gonna have to ask you all to leave.'
Monica	 Come on! Chandler!'
Chandler	 Look, forget it. We tried, but Phase Three is a lost cause, Okay?\nThose strippers were insanely hot, and I couldn\xc2\x92t picture myself with any of them.\n(Sits back in disgust.)'
Monica	 They really were pretty, weren\xc2\x92t they? (Rachel and Phoebe both\nagree)'
Phoebe	 Yeah, I really liked that fighter pilot one.'
Monica	 Oh, Candy! She was so spunky! '
Phoebe	 Yeah.'
Monica	 Y\xc2\x92know, I think if I were going to be with a woman. (Chandler is\nintrigued.) It\xc2\x92d, it\xc2\x92d be with someone like Michelle, she was so oh, she was so\npetite.'
Rachel	 See, I don\xc2\x92t know, for me it would have to Chantal.'
Monica	 Oh, Chantal!'
Rachel	 Oh my goodness, she had the smoothest skin! I mean when I stuck that\ndollar bill in her g-string and grazed her thigh\xc2\x85'
Chandler	 (jumping up) Phase Three! I just achieved Phase Three!'
Monica	 Really?!'
Chandler	 I am totally picturing you with all those women!'
Monica	 That\xc2\x92s-that\xc2\x92s not Phase Three.'
Chandler	 Well, I\xc2\x92m there too!'
Rachel	 Well, are we all together? Like in a group?'
Chandler	 Stop it! You\xc2\x92re killing me! I think I just moved on to Phase\nFour!'
Phoebe	 Oh! What is that? What is that?'
Chandler	 Where I don\xc2\x92t want to have a relationship ever! I just want to\nhave sex with strippers and my friends!!'
Chandler	 Come on, let me see that smile.'
Joey	 I don\xc2\x92t wanna.'
Chandler	 Please?'
Joey	 I wanted to go to the strip club!'
Chandler	 I know, I know, but you\xc2\x92re gonna have plenty of chances. There\nare literally thousands of women out there just waiting to screw me over.'
Joey	 Yeah, all right. (Ross enters.)'
Monica	 Hey!'
Ross	 Hey!'
Phoebe	 Hey\xc2\x97ooh so, how was Vermont?'
Ross	 Emily is\xc2\x85incredible. I mean there-there are no words to describe it,\nI mean the whole weekend was like a dream. (Sees Rachel coming back from the bathroom.)\nOh! And you! Rach!'
Rachel	 Oh, hey!'
Ross	 Hey! You were so right!'
Rachel	 What?'
Ross	 Uh, what you said, about us being in a place where we could finally be\nhappy for each other. '
Rachel	 Oh, hmm.'
Ross	 I mean, I, I-I admit I-I wasn\xc2\x92t quite there. Y\xc2\x92know, I mean the\nthought of you and that-that Josh guy\xc2\x85'
Rachel	 Joshua.'
Ross	 Joshua\xc2\x85guy at that club, dancing and having a good time, the thought\nof it kinda\xc2\x85y\xc2\x92know.'
Rachel	 Yeah, I\xc2\x85'
Ross	 But now! I\xc2\x92m there! I\xc2\x92m totally there! I\xc2\x92m-I\xc2\x92m finally\nwhere you are!'
Rachel	 Oh, thank goodness!'
Ross	 Yeah, and-and thank you for Emily.'
Rachel	 Oh, no problem. I\xc2\x92m so glad I could help. Happy for you. (She\nplayfully punches him.)'
Ross	 Happy for you. (He punches her back.)'
Rachel	 No, happy for you! (Hits him harder.)'

Chandler	 All right ladies, here\xc2\x92s what we\xc2\x92re gonna do. (Points to a\nstripper.) You are gonna take off my clothes. (To another two strippers) You two,\ngo get the oils. (To another stripper) And you just constantly scream at the top of your\nvoice, "Chandler\xc2\x92s the king! Chandler\xc2\x92s the king!"'
Phoebe	 I-I wanna be with her, (points to the stripper next to her) I like her.'
Chandler	 Oh, that\xc2\x92s fine! Go with your instincts, go with your instincts.'
Monica	 Wait, now, what am I doing again?'
Chandler	 Come on! Would you please pay attention, I could wake up at any\nmoment!'
The Cigarette Guy	 Hi, I\xc2\x92m Joshua, I\xc2\x92m here to pick up Rachel.'
Rachel	 No-no-no, that\xc2\x92 not Joshua.'
Chandler	 What do you want from me, I\xc2\x92ve never met the guy. So anyway,\nRachel, I\xc2\x92m sorry you can\xc2\x92t stay, (Rachel is upset about leaving the orgy with\nthe cigarette guy.) but the rest of us have a lot of work to do. (The cigarette guy\nstarts rubbing Chandler\xc2\x92s back.) What are you doing? (The guy just nods) All right,\nlisten, I\xc2\x92ve got to wake up!'
