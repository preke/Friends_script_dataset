Monica	 So the wedding caterer sent me this list of twelve appetizers and I have\nto narrow it down to six.'
Joey	 Food? Uh-huh gimme! (She hands him the paper.)'
Chandler	 So did Monica tell you about this great band called the Swing Kings\nthat we\xc2\x92re trying to get to play at the wedding?'
Phoebe	 Since when are you into swing music?'
Chandler	 Oh since forever! I used to go all over town listening to bands!'
Monica	 Chandler.'
Chandler	 Gap commercial. (To Monica) So did you book them? Did you call?'
Monica	 I will.'
Chandler	 Do you want me to call?'
Monica	 No, I\xc2\x92ll do it. You just stick to your job.'
Phoebe	 What is your job?'
Chandler	 Staying out of the way.'
Joey	 This is impossible Monica, why don\xc2\x92t you just pick all 15? (Hands\nback the paper.)'
Monica	 There were only twelve.'
Joey	 Oh yeah, I added three.'
Monica	 What are peanut butter fingers?!'
Joey	 Oh yeah\xc2\x85 (He mimes sticking his fingers into a jar of peanut butter,\nscooping some out, and eating it off his fingers.)'

Ross	 (noticing a beautiful woman moving in down the street) Well hello!\nShe\xc2\x92s cute! Should we uh, go try to talk to her?'
Chandler	 Sure! That\xc2\x92s one of the great things about being engaged.\nI\xc2\x92m not nervous talking to pretty girls anymore.'
Ross	 Uh yeah! Let me, let me get that for you.'
Ross	 (exhales) I got it. (He lifts the box and grunts under the strain.)\n(Calmly) So hi, I\xc2\x92m uh, I\xc2\x92m Ross and this is my friend Chandler. (He shyly\nwaves.)'
Ross	 Kristen, hi. Are you uh, new to the area, \xc2\x91cause if you\nare\xc2\x85I\xc2\x92d love to show you around sometime.'
Kristen	 I\xc2\x85I uh, actually just moved from four blocks over.'
Ross	 Ah.'
Kristen	 But-but this block is like a whole other world.'
Ross	 Y\xc2\x92know actually it does have a very interesting history. Uh, this\nstreet is the first street in the city to have an underground sewer system. (Kristen\ncrinkles her nose at that.) Before that sewage and waste would just flow right down the\nstreet. Yeah, sometimes ankle deep! (He stops when he realizes what he\xc2\x92s talking\nabout.)'
Chandler	 (To Ross) Smooth.'
Kristen	 (To Chandler) Excuse me? (Chandler does the shy thing again.)'
Ross	 Umm, say you\xc2\x92re gonna be starving after all this moving. What do you\nsay I take you to dinner tonight?'
Kristen	 Oh I\xc2\x92d like that.'
Ross	 Yeah?'
Kristen	 Yeah.'
Ross	 Great! Uh, let me take this up for you. (The box he\xc2\x92s holding.)'
Kristen	 After you.'
Ross	 Oh no-no, after you. (She grabs a chair and heads upstairs.) (When\nshe\xc2\x92s gone.) Oh my God! (He drops the box and Chandler can\xc2\x92t pick it up.)'
Phoebe	 (wearing a veil) Am I crazy or does this totally go?!'
Rachel	 Oh my God! You look so beautiful!'
Phoebe	 (To Rachel) Thank you Rachel but, look at Monica!'
Monica	 This is it. Yeah, this is the one. I can\xc2\x92t believe I found it!'
Monica	 Well I\xc2\x92m Monica Geller, ball like a baby.'
Monica	 Have you found your dress yet?'
Megan	 Oh no, these dresses are all so amazing but there is no way I could\nafford one.'
Monica	 No, I can\xc2\x92t afford this either. No. I-I-I\xc2\x92m, I\xc2\x92m just to\nfigure out which one I want then I\xc2\x92m gonna get it at Kleinman\xc2\x92s, this discount\nplace in Brooklyn, day after tomorrow they are having a huge sale.'
Megan	 Oh, thanks for the tip.'
Monica	 Yeah! So-so when are you getting married?'
Megan	 Oh I\xc2\x92m not, I just like to try these on.'
Rachel	 I do the same thing.'
Megan	 I\xc2\x92m just kidding. I\xc2\x92m getting married July 25th.'
Rachel	 I\xc2\x92m just kidding too. (Laughs) I\xc2\x92m getting married in\nDecember. (Turns away not happy with herself.)'
Megan	 (To Monica) So when are you getting married?'
Monica	 Oh May 15th.'
Megan	 Oooh it\xc2\x92s getting close!'
Monica	 Yeah!'
Megan	 So uh, who\xc2\x92s your photographer?'

Monica	 The best man? Wow!'
Megan	 I know! I almost called off my wedding. Oh, who\xc2\x92s your band?!'
Monica	 Oh, my fiancee wants the Swing Kings.'
Megan	 Oh, you\xc2\x92re so lucky. My fiancee wants the heavy metal band Carcass. '
Phoebe	 Ooh, is that spelled with a \xc2\x91C\xc2\x92 or a \xc2\x91K\xc2\x92? Oh my God!\nIt doesn\xc2\x92t matter; they\xc2\x92re both great!'
Rachel	 Oh y\xc2\x92know what? Y\xc2\x92know what? Now that you know what you want\nyou should go to Kleinman\xc2\x92s and get it half off. This place is so overpriced.'
Rachel	 So, does this (The dress) come in another color or\xc2\x85 (The store\nowner walks away.)'
Joey	 (checking her out) Hi! You uh, movin\xc2\x92 in or movin\xc2\x92 out?'
Kristen	 I\xc2\x92m moving in.'
Joey	 Oh uh, can I give you a hand?'
Kristen	 Oh okay. But y\xc2\x92know what? Be careful. Because a guy was helping me\nbefore had to leave because he hurt his back.'
Joey	 Boyfriend?'
Kristen	 No.'
Joey	 I\xc2\x92m Joey. (They shake hands.)'
Kristen	 Kristen.'
Joey	 Oh wow, what a beautiful name! (Pause) What is it again?'
Kristen	 Kristen.'

Kristen	 So uh, do you live around here?'
Joey	 Yeah! Yeah! Right down there. (Points.) Hey listen; let me give you a\nlittle tip. Do not take a nap on this stoop (Points to hers) or you can wake up with your\nshoes gone.'
Kristen	 I\xc2\x92ll remember that.'
Joey	 Okay. Yeah. Listen would you uh, would you like to have dinner with me\ntonight?'
Kristen	 Oh I, I have plans tonight. '
Joey	 Oh.'
Kristen	 But how about tomorrow?'
Joey	 Sounds great! Okay all right, well where does this go? (The lamp he\xc2\x92s\nholding.)'
Kristen	 You look strong, why don\xc2\x92t I take that and you grab one of the\nboxes.'
Joey	 Okay. Yeah. (She leaves and he goes to pick up a box marked books, but\ndecides to take the box marked pillows instead.) Yeah, I\xc2\x92ll grab this one. (He\nfollows her upstairs.)'
Rachel	 (To Phoebe) So this is Brooklyn.'
Monica	 All right, listen up. There is usually only one dress in each size so\nwhen they open those doors, fan out. Now, this is what you\xc2\x92re looking for! (Holds up\na picture of it.) Memorize it! When you locate the dress, blow on these. All right? (She\npasses out whistles to them.) Three short blasts, when you hear it. Come running.'
Rachel	 Okay.'
Phoebe	 Got it.'
Monica	 All right.'
Rachel	 Oh they\xc2\x92re pushing! They\xc2\x92re pushing!!'
Monica	 (To Rachel) Hey! Don\xc2\x92t be a baby!'
Rachel	 Well I\xc2\x85'
Phoebe	 (coming back out) Hey! Rachel! Come on!!!!'
Monica	 No. No. Not it. Not it. Not it. (Checks another rack and another woman\ntries to reach around her.) (To the woman) Don\xc2\x92t crowd me! (Finds it) This is it!\nThis is the dress! Oh my God, it\xc2\x92s perfect! (She takes it off of the rack and someone\nhas a hold of it on the other side of the rack and tugs on it.) I\xc2\x92m sorry, this\none\xc2\x92s taken! (The other woman tugs harder pulling Monica through the rack.) Whoa!'
Monica	 Megan!'
Megan	 Monica!'
Monica	 You came?!'
Megan	 Yeah!'
Monica	 This is my dress!'
Megan	 No!'
Monica	 Yes it is! You saw me wearing it!'
Megan	 And now you\xc2\x92ll see me buying it.'
Monica	 What? You freak! You wouldn\xc2\x92t even have known about this place if\nit wasn\xc2\x92t for me!'
Megan	 Look, you don\xc2\x92t want to fight me.'
Monica	 Maybe I do! I\xc2\x92m pretty feisty! (She blows the signal.)'
Phoebe	 (hearing the signal) I\xc2\x92m coming! I\xc2\x92m coming! (She takes off\ntowards the signal and almost knocks another woman over.)'
Phoebe	 Okay! (Runs that way and hears another whistle blast.) Hey! (Heads the\nother way and hears another blast.) What do I do?!! (She runs in the second direction and\nfinds that the whistling is coming from inside a rack. She moves the dresses out of the\nway to find Rachel curled up in a fetal position frantically blowing on the whistle.) What\nare you doing? (Rachel doesn\xc2\x92t stop.) Did you find the dress? (Rachel won\xc2\x92t stop\nso Phoebe pinches her nose shut which causes her to spit the whistle out.)'
Phoebe	 Did you find the dress?'
Rachel	 No! You gotta get me out of here Phoebe! These bargain shoppers are\ncrazy!'
Phoebe	 I\xc2\x97We gotta get Monica. (She starts to leave.)'
Rachel	 No! You gotta hold my hand!!'
Phoebe	 Oh my God!! (She grabs Rachel\xc2\x92s hand and drags her towards Monica.)\nExcuse me! Excuse me! (She\xc2\x92s knocking women and veils out of the way as she moves.) '
Monica	 (handing Phoebe the dress) Go! Go! Go!'
Rachel	 (seeing who\xc2\x92s trapped) Hey\xc2\x85'
Monica	 NOW!!!!!!!! (Rachel runs off and Monica gets up to follow her.)'
Chandler	 So Ross, how was your date the other night? Did you tell her about the\nmagical ride that starts with the flush of every toilet?'
Ross	 Laugh all you want but uh, she actually left me a message saying\nshe\xc2\x92d like to go out again.'
Chandler	 Huh.'
Ross	 Yeah in fact, I\xc2\x92m gonna go call her right now. And I\xc2\x92ll make\nsure to tell her my friend Chandler says\xc2\x85 (He mimics the shy reaction Chandler did.)'
Joey	 (entering) Hey Chandler!'
Chandler	 Hey!'
Joey	 Listen, sorry I didn\xc2\x92t stop by last night but I had a date.'
Chandler	 Uh Joe, when it\xc2\x92s one o\xc2\x92clock in the morning and you\ndon\xc2\x92t come by? That\xc2\x92s okay!'

Joey	 Well, I sorta am. I mean yeah, I\xc2\x92m dating this girl who\xc2\x92s also\nseeing another guy. But, I don\xc2\x92t know, I\xc2\x92m not to worried about it.'
Ross	 Well you shouldn\xc2\x92t be. Believe me I wouldn\xc2\x92t want to be the guy\nwho\xc2\x92s up against you. (Chandler laughs.) I mean that doofus is going to lose!'
Chandler	 So this is nice! I wish I didn\xc2\x92t have to go, believe me! But\nunfortunately I have to. (He gets up and Joey moves over next to Ross.) Oh uh, by the way,\nwhat\xc2\x92s the name the girl you\xc2\x92re dating?'

Ross	 Well obviously only one of us can keep dating her.'
Joey	 Obviously! So, how do we decide?'
Ross	 Well now let\xc2\x92s-let\xc2\x92s look at this objectively, I think I should\ndate her\xc2\x85'

Ross	 That\xc2\x92s interesting, but check this out. I date her\xc2\x85'

Joey	 Ah yeah\xc2\x97wait a second now! Look we\xc2\x92re gonna have to set a\nspending limit on the date. I don\xc2\x92t have the money to take her to a fancy place like\nthat.'
Ross	 Well sorry, that\xc2\x92s what I do on dates.'
Joey	 All right, well I guess I\xc2\x92ll just have to do what I do on dates.'
Ross	 So let\xc2\x92s decide on the spending limit\xc2\x85'
Joey	 Yeah. Uh, (thinks)\xc2\x85a slice\xc2\x85(Thinks)\xc2\x85six dollars?'

Chandler	 Look all I know is when Monica and I went to see them, we had fun! And\nthere\xc2\x92s another reason too.'
Rachel	 Well, what is the other reason?'
Chandler	 I don\xc2\x92t want to say.'
Rachel	 Well you have to because maybe it\xc2\x92s stupid.'
Chandler	 Well it\xc2\x92s just while Monica and I were dancing to them it\nwas\xc2\x85the first time I knew that\xc2\x85you were the woman I wanted to dance all my\ndances with.'
Monica	 Oh crap!'
Ross	 So they said our table will be ready in just a few minutes.'

Kristen	 You said the waiter ate my crab cake.'
Joey	 (laughs that one off) Yeah. So uh Ross, well now\xc2\x97why did that first\nmarriage breakup? Was it because the woman was straight or she was a lesbian?'
Kristen	 Do you two know each other?'
Joey and Ross	 No. No.'
Joey	 No. It just seems like Ross is the kind of a guy that would marry a woman\non the verge of being a lesbian and then push her over the edge.'
Ross	 Wait a minute! Were you on a poster for gonorrhea?'
Joey	 Have you ever slept in the same bed as a monkey?!'
Ross	 Hey you leave Marcel out of this!'

Chandler	 Okay I promise. I\xc2\x92ll-I\xc2\x92ll hate it. (She enters.) Wow!\nYou-you look\xc2\x85hideous.'
Monica	 Really?'
Chandler	 Yeah, that\xc2\x92s like the most ugliest dress I\xc2\x92ve ever seen.\nWh-why do you to return it?'
