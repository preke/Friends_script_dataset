Joey	 What secrets?'
Chandler	 Oh no-no Joey, I am not going to tell you because I am an excellent\nsecret keeper.'
Joey	 (whispering to Chandler) You\xc2\x92ll tell me later?'
Chandler	 You already know.'

Phoebe	 Oh, it's so romantic to send people off on their honeymoon."
Joey	 Y\xc2\x92know, Monica and Chandler are married. Ross and Rachel are having a\nbaby. Maybe you and I should do something.'
Phoebe	 All in good time my love. All in good time. Oh shoot! I left my guitar\nin their apartment. Well you can let me in later.'
Joey	 I don\xc2\x92t have a key, they took mine to give to you.'
Phoebe	 What?! They took mine to give to you!'
Joey	 Why would they take away our keys?'
Phoebe	 Maybe they don\xc2\x92t trust us.'
Joey	 No that\xc2\x92s not it. They let me keep my key the last time they were out\nof town. '
Phoebe	 You mean the time you broke the ketchup bottle and cleaned it up with\nMonica\xc2\x92s guest towels?'
Joey	 Hey, I washed those!'
Phoebe	 No you didn\xc2\x92t.'
Joey	 Yeah that didn\xc2\x92t sound like me.'
Phoebe	 Well, what am I gonna do? I really need my guitar!'
Joey	 Yeah, I have stuff in there too.'
Phoebe	 What stuff?'
Joey	 Monica\xc2\x92s chicken parm! I\xc2\x92ll take care of it. (He picks up the\nphone) Hey Mr. Treeger, it\xc2\x92s Joey Tribbiani.

Phoebe	 Well, she really wanted to talk to you now.'
Joey	 Yeah, it seemed pretty important.'
Ross	 Oh no.'
Phoebe	 What?'
Ross	 I think I might know what this is about.'
Joey	 Really?'
Ross	 Yeah. Uh, uh we promised we weren\xc2\x92t gonna tell anybody this but uh,\nabout a month ago Rachel and I slept together.'
Phoebe	 (deadpan) And?'
Ross	 Wow! I thought you would be a little more shocked.'
Phoebe	 Oh sorry. (Shocked) And?!'
Ross	 Well, we-we said we\xc2\x92d just do it that one time but, but now I think\nshe may wanna start things up again.'
Joey	 Yeah, I don\xc2\x92t think that\xc2\x92s what it is.'
Ross	 Why? What-what else could it be?'
Joey	 Oh wow, I don\xc2\x92t feel well.'
Ross	 I\xc2\x92m telling you. I\xc2\x92m telling you. That\xc2\x92s what it is. No\nwonder she was looking at me all funny during the wedding. She didn\xc2\x92t say anything to\nyou?'
Phoebe	 (To Joey) Maybe it\xc2\x92s something you ate?'
Joey	 Please, just-just, just go and talk to Rachel.'
Ross	 Yeah, I guess I should. (Starts to leave.) Man, y\xc2\x92know what I have to\nrealize? Maybe I\xc2\x92m just not the type of guy women can have just one night with.\nY\xc2\x92know, they-they always seem to want a little bit more. I should remember that. (He\npauses and then exits.)'
Ticket Agent	 Next?'
Monica	 They\xc2\x92re kissing let\xc2\x92s just go around them.'

Monica	 You see, if we\xc2\x92d gone around them like I said, we\xc2\x97She\nwould\xc2\x92ve given us those tickets. Damnit!'
Chandler	 25J and K, any chance those aren\xc2\x92t together?'
Joey	 I still can\xc2\x92t believe they took away my key. You trust me with yours.'
Phoebe	 Of course I do! And I\xc2\x92m gonna give it back to you as soon as\nthey\xc2\x92re done with it at the key shining place.'
Joey	 What the hell is that?'
Joey	 Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Treeger, what are you doing?'
Mr. Treeger	 You said there was a gas leak in here.'
Phoebe	 Well why don\xc2\x92t you use your key?'
Mr. Treeger	 Because by the time I find it on this thing (Holds up a huge key\nring with a thousand keys on it), the whole place might have exploded. If that happens at\nanother building that I manage, people are gonna start asking questions. (To the fireman)\nCome on! Hurry up.'
Phoebe	 Oh! We could have done that.'
Monica	 Look at that! Look at that! They\xc2\x92re going into the first class\nlounge! Do you know what they have in there?'

Ross	 Hi.'
Rachel	 Hi. (He helps her up.) Umm, I think there\xc2\x92s something that we\nreally need to talk about.'

Rachel	 You do?'
Ross	 Yeah, and to save you from any embarrassment umm, I think maybe I should\ntalk first.'

Ross	 Okay. (He sits her down in a chair.) Uh, Ross and Rachel. Rachel and Ross.\nThat\xc2\x92s been one heck of a see-saw hasn\xc2\x92t it?'
Rachel	 (confused) What?'
Ross	 I mean look, that-that one night we had was fun and\xc2\x85and certainly\npassionate, but don\xc2\x92t you think it\xc2\x92s better if we just stayed friends?'

Joey	 (eating) Huh. So then I can heat this up? (Goes and does so.)'
Mr. Treeger	 Anyway uh, I\xc2\x92ll get moving on that new door.'
Phoebe	 Oh great! And listen, could you do us a favor and not tell Chandler and\nMonica about this? \xc2\x91Cause y\xc2\x92know umm, they don\xc2\x92t-they don\xc2\x92t have any\nkids of their own and-and this door was like a child to them.'
Mr. Treeger	 Well I\xc2\x92m gonna have to put on a new lock, they\xc2\x92ll find\nout anyway.'
Phoebe	 Oh no.'

Ross	 You already know don\xc2\x92t you?'
Phoebe	 A little bit.'
Joey	 How are you doing?'
Ross	 Okay. Okay. I mean I\xc2\x92ll be okay. It\xc2\x92s just I don\xc2\x92t think I\nhandled it very well.'
Joey	 Well, what did you say to her?'
Ross	 Nothing. But the complaint department at the condom company got an earful.\nAnd then when I turned around she was gone.'
Phoebe	 Oh Ross.'
Ross	 But hey, in my defense I-I just found out condoms are like only 97%\neffective.'
Joey	 (shocked) What?'
Ross	 I gotta go find her.'
Joey	 Whoa! Hey! Whoa!! Hold up! Are you serious?! So like 3% of the time they\ndon\xc2\x92t even work?! Huh? They should put that on the box!'
Ross	 Evidently they do.'
Joey	 What?! (Grabs his condoms from his pocket and looks.)'
Monica	 I can\xc2\x92t believe we\xc2\x92re here.'
Chandler	 Oh you\xc2\x92ve got to be kidding me.'
Monica	 What? (Monica sees the first couple and gasps.)'
Front Desk Clerk	 As a wedding gift to you, the hotel would like to give you the\nhoneymoon suite.'
Monica	 No!! You have been screwing us all day!'
Man	 Who are you?'
Chandler	 We\xc2\x92re you just ten seconds later!'
Monica	 Yeah! You already got the first class tickets; you got the lounge! I\nmean we should get free stuff too! I mean you\xc2\x92re not the only ones on your honeymoon!'
Woman	 Well you can have the suite if you want. We don\xc2\x92t care about where\nwe stay. We\xc2\x92re here to celebrate our love together. We don\xc2\x92t have to get free\nstuff. We just want to be together.'
Chandler	 (looks at Monica then at them) We need the stuff.'
Joey	 Hey Monica it\xc2\x92s Joey. Listen uh, Phoebe and I smell gas comin\xc2\x92\nfrom your apartment.'
Monica	 What? Are you serious?! (To Chandler) Joey smells gas!'
Chandler	 What else is new?'
Joey	 Yeah and we\xc2\x92d go check it out, but you took away our keys.'
Monica	 Well do something! Get in there!'
Joey	 How? I guess I could break down your door.'
Monica	 Yeah! Do that!'
Joey	 And-and you won\xc2\x92t blame us for any damage? (Gives Phoebe a thumbs\nup.)'
Monica	 No! (Pause) Are you doing it?! I don\xc2\x92t hear anything! Come on!'
Joey	 Uh, okay I\xc2\x92ll-I\xc2\x92ll-I\xc2\x92ll break it down. (He hands the phone\nto Phoebe, gets up, picks up a chair, and starts banging it on the floor.)'
Phoebe	 Oh hey hi, he\xc2\x92s doing it. He\xc2\x92s breaking down the door. (The\nchair breaks in half.) Okay, we\xc2\x92re in. (She hangs up the phone.)'
Nurse	 Okay Rachel, are you comfortable?'
Rachel	 (sighs) If I said I was, would you judge me?'
Nurse	 The doctor will be here in a minute to do your sonogram.'
Rachel	 Okay. (The nurse exits.) Oh man, I swear if they sold these at Pottery\nBarn\xc2\x85'
Ross	 Hi!'
Rachel	 (shocked) Hi!'
Ross	 Uh we-we need to talk.'
Rachel	 Uh-uh-uh, right now? Because I\xc2\x92ve kinda got an el fresco situation\ngoing on over here.'
Ross	 Please, please I want to apologize for the way I acted earlier today.'
Rachel	 Okay Ross that\xc2\x92s fine, but can you please stand near my head?'
Ross	 What? Oh yeah. (He moves next to her head.) I\xc2\x92m sorry. I mean I-I\nthink I went a little crazy. I mean I was thinking about myself when I (Wanders towards\nRachel\xc2\x92s feet) really\xc2\x97I should have been thinking about you Rach\xc2\x85'
Rachel	 Okay. Head Ross! Head Ross! Head Ross!'
Ross	 Right! Right! I just\xc2\x97I want you to know that I\xc2\x92m going to be\nthere through this whole thing, okay? Okay? The doctor\xc2\x92s appointments, the uh, the\nLamaze classes, uh baby-proofing the apartment\xc2\x97Although we could probably worry about\nthat \xc2\x91til after we get married.'
Rachel	 What married?'
Ross	 Well yeah, I think we should get married.'
Rachel	 What, because that\xc2\x92s your answer to everything?'
Ross	 No, because that\xc2\x92s the right thing to do.'
Rachel	 Yeah, maybe if you\xc2\x92re in love. But Ross, we are not in love, are\nwe?'
Ross	 No but\xc2\x85but still you can\xc2\x92t possibly do this alone.'
Rachel	 Excuse me?'
Ross	 Come on Rach, you can\xc2\x92t even eat alone in a restaurant.'
Rachel	 What?!'
Ross	 I\xc2\x92m just saying if you can\xc2\x92t eat by yourself, how do you expect\nto have a baby by yourself?'
Rachel	 I can too eat by myself!'
Ross	 When have you ever?'
Rachel	 When certain people leave the table and I am not finished!'
Ross	 Well certain other people take two hours to eat a bowl of soup!'
Rachel	 Oh please, you inhale your food!'
Ross	 I grew up with Monica! If you didn\xc2\x92t eat fast you didn\xc2\x92t eat!!'
Dr. Long	 (entering) Am I interrupting?'
Rachel	 Oh no Dr. Long, please come in. This is Ross, he is the father.'
Ross	 But not the husband, because evidently she can do this alone.'
Dr. Long	 Huh. Nice to meet you. I\xc2\x92ll get started on this.'
Ross	 (To Rachel, standing by her feet) I don\xc2\x92t know why you can\xc2\x92t\nadmit that you need me.'
Rachel	 I do need you! I need you to stand near my head!'
Dr. Long	 Okay, everything looks good. Here it is on the screen. (We see Ross\nand Rachel looking at the screen.) Here is your uterus. And right here is your baby.'

Rachel	 I know, I lied! I didn\xc2\x92t want her to think I was a terrible mother!\nI can\xc2\x92t even see my own baby!'
Ross	 Oh sure, come here! (Sits her up) Sure you can! Uh, look come here look,\n(rolls the machine closer) it\xc2\x92s-it\xc2\x92s-it\xc2\x92s, it\xc2\x92s right there (Points).'
