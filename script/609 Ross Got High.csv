Monica	 (on phone) Okay, great!\xc2\xa0 Bye. (Hangs up as Chandler enters.) So\nguess who\xc2\x92s coming to Thanksgiving dinner?'
Chandler	 Sydney Portier? Hehheh.'
Monica	 (not amused by Chandler\xc2\x92s joke) I miss Rachel. (To Chandler) No, my\nparents.'
Chandler	 Oh! That\xc2\x92s great, they haven\xc2\x92t seen the place since I moved\nin!'
Monica	 Yeah, and y\xc2\x92know, if you could not mention to them that we live\ntogether, that would be great! (Quickly trying to change subjects), I was thinking we\nwould eat around four.'
Chandler	 (shocked at the news) Why can\xc2\x92t I tell them that we live\ntogether?'
Monica	 Because they don\xc2\x92t know we\xc2\x92re dating. (Again, trying to\nquickly change subjects.) Do you think we should eat in the kitchen? (Goes to the sink and\nthe stove to cook.)'
Chandler	 Why haven\xc2\x92t you told them?!'
Monica	 Um, well, I was going to, I-I-I really was. But um, then somewhere, just\nout of nowhere, I didn\xc2\x92t.'
Chandler	 Why haven\xc2\x92t you told them?! Wouldn\xc2\x92t they be happy?!'
Monica	 (trying to change subjects, excitedly) So! Dinner in the kitchen around\nfour! I\xc2\x92ll see you then. (Pats Chandler on the shoulder and goes into the living\nroom.)'
Chandler	 Why wouldn\xc2\x92t they be happy?'
Monica	 Well, um, because mainly, um, they don\xc2\x92t like you. I\xc2\x92m sorry.'
Chandler	 What? What? Why?!'
Monica	 Maybe because you used to be aloof, or that you\xc2\x92re really\nsarcastic, or that, y\xc2\x92know, you joke around all the time. Or that you take off your\nclothes and throw them on the couch.'
Chandler	 Is this why they don\xc2\x92t like me or why you don\xc2\x92t like me?'
Monica	 Look, I know that I should\xc2\x92ve told them. I know I shouldn\xc2\x92t\ncare what they think. I\xc2\x92m sorry. '
Chandler	 Y\xc2\x92know, it\xc2\x92ll be okay. It\xc2\x92ll be okay. Because when they\ncome over, I will be all charming, I will make them fall in love with me, and then\nwe\xc2\x92ll tell \xc2\x91em.'
Monica	 You really think that\xc2\x92ll work?'
Chandler	 Hey, I can be pretty charming, babe, I won YOU over, didn\xc2\x92t I?'
Monica	 (hugging Chandler) I don\xc2\x92t think you\xc2\x92ll ever get my parents\nthat drunk! '

Chandler	 Hey! (Sees Ross is there) Oh, good, Ross! You\xc2\x92re parents like me,\nright?'
Ross	 (only half-paying attention) Yes, of course they like you!'
Chandler	 Well Monica just told me that they don\xc2\x92t.'
Ross	 (not paying attention) Yeah, they don\xc2\x92t like you.'
Chandler	 (annoyed) Do you know why?'
Ross	 I dunno, maybe it\xc2\x92s because you\xc2\x92re really sarcastic. Or maybe\nit\xc2\x92s cause you uh-'
Chandler	 (angry) Well if people don\xc2\x92t know they shouldn\xc2\x92t just guess!'
Chandler	 This is great, another Thanksgiving with nothing to give thanks for.'
Joey	 Maybe I could give thanks for you shuttin\xc2\x92 up, eh?'
Chandler	 Maybe I could give thanks by taking my Playstation over to my\nnew apartment.'
Joey	 Well maybe I love ya\xc2\x92.'
Chandler	 [mocks that last comment].'
Chandler	 Hey.'
Janine	 Hey guys!'
Ross	 (trying to act manly in front of Janine) No I don\xc2\x92t want to\nplay video games, Joey!'
Janine	 Are you guys going to Chandler\xc2\x92s for Thanksgiving?'
Joey	 Yeah! Yeah, why? What\xc2\x92s up?'
Janine	 Well, me and my dancer friends are thinking of doing Thanksgiving\nuptown. I thought you guys might like to come.'
Ross	 For real?'
Janine	 No, but you should go to Chandler\xc2\x92s. Because none of us knows how\nto cook, we\xc2\x92ll probably just end up drinking all day.'
Joey	 Ye-ye, we go to yours!'
Ross	 Yeah, see, we-we-we have to stop across the hall, because it\xc2\x92s my\nsister. But, uh, uh y\xc2\x92know actually, growing up with a sister was nice because it\nreally helped me understand women. Yeah, you-you should tell your friends that.'
Janine	 (not sure of what to make of that) Okay.'
Joey	 How you got three women to marry you, I\xc2\x92ll never know.'
Phoebe	 Hey!'
All	 Hey!'
Rachel	 Hey! Hey, Pheebs, check it out. Yeah, for my desert, I have chosen to\nmake a traditional English truffle!'
Phoebe	 Wow, that sounds great! And what are you making Monica, in case\nRachel\xc2\x92s dessert is...[about to say \xc2\x93bad\xc2\x94] so good that I eat all of it.\nThere\xc2\x92s none left for anybody else!'
Monica	 Nothing.'
Rachel	 (worried) Nothing?'
Monica	 No, sweetie, I-I trust you.'
Rachel	 So, if-if I mess this up, there\xc2\x92s nothing else for dessert?'
Monica	 You\xc2\x92re not gonna mess it up.'
Rachel	 Wow, Monica, I love that, you really have faith in me. Thank you.\nTechnical question, how do you know when uh, the butter\xc2\x92s done?'
Monica	 Well, it\xc2\x92s done about two minutes before it looks like that.'
Joey and Ross	 Hey!'
All	 Hey!'
Joey	 Oh, ooh the food smells great, Mon!'
Ross	 And the place looks so nice!'
Joey	 Yeah, hey hey, Happy Thanksgiving everybody!'
Ross	 Happy Thanksgiving!'
The Girls	 Happy Thanksgiving!'
Joey	 Well, this has been great!'
Ross	 See ya!'
Monica	 Whoa whoa whoa! Where\xc2\x92re you goin\xc2\x92?'
Ross	 Oh, oh, we did say we\xc2\x92d stop by this little thing Joey\xc2\x92s\nroommate is having.'
Monica	 Oh, Janine, the really hot dancer girl?'
Ross	 Some would say she\xc2\x92s attractive, yes.'
Phoebe	 And who else is going to be there?'
Joey	 Uh, some of her friends, yeah.'
Rachel	 Her dancer friends?'
Joey	 (frustrated) Yes, all right? All of her hot dancer friends are gonna be\nthere and they\xc2\x92re gonna be, be drinkin\xc2\x92 and dancin, and we really wanna go!'
Ross	 (to Joey) Dude, we were good!'
Monica	 You\xc2\x92re not gonna go anywhere, you said you were gonna eat here, and\nyou\xc2\x92re gonna eat here!'
Phoebe	 Yeah, and-and leaving us to go see hot dancer girls is not very\nThanksgivingy.'
Ross	 Oh, but-but it is, uh, it\xc2\x92s just like the first Thanksgiving, when\nthe Indians and the Pilgrims uh, sat down to dinner.'
Joey	 Yeah, yeah, and the Indians taught the Pilgrims what it meant to be hot in\nthe new world!'
Mrs. Geller	 Hello everybody!'
Mr. Geller	 Hi!'
All	 Hi!'
Monica	 Dad [kisses Jack], Mom [kisses Judy]. Look! Look who it is it\xc2\x92s\nChandler!'
Mrs. Geller	 (less than pleased) Oh yes of course, hello Chandler.'
Chandler	 Mr. and Mrs. Geller, you look wonderful, it is great to have you hear,\nlet us take off your coats!'
Chandler	 Whoa, snowing out there?'
Mr. Geller	 (angry) No.'
Mr. Geller	 Monica, all this food looks wonderful, you should think about doing\nthis for a living.'
Mr. Geller	 Ok, I have dandruff. There\xc2\x92s no need to laugh and point.'
Monica	 Dad, Chandler was just laughing at your joke.'
Mr. Geller	 My joke wasn\xc2\x92t funny.'
Phoebe	 Rach, Rach, I just remembered. I had a dream about Mr. Geller last\nnight.'
Rachel	 Really?!'
Phoebe	 Yeah, I dreamt that he saved me from a burning building and he was so\nbrave and so strong! And it\xc2\x92s making me look at him totally differently. Y\xc2\x92know,\nI mean he used to be just, y\xc2\x92know \xc2\x93Jack Geller Monica and Ross\xc2\x92s dad\xc2\x94\nand now he\xc2\x92s he\xc2\x92s \xc2\x93Jack Geller, dream hunk."'
Rachel	 I dunno. Y\xc2\x92know to me he\xc2\x92ll always be \xc2\x93Jack Geller, walks\nin while you\xc2\x92re changing.\xc2\x94'
Monica	 Y\xc2\x92know dad, Chandler is one of Ross\xc2\x92s very best friends!'
Chandler	 Yeah, Ross sure is a great guy, y\xc2\x92know I\xc2\x92ve always felt that\nhow a young man turns out is a reflection on his father.'
Mr. Geller	 I always thought that too. Tell me, what does your father do?'
Chandler	 (worried) He\xc2\x92s the headliner of a gay burlesque show.'
Joey	 Rach, you\xc2\x92re killin\xc2\x92 us here, will ya serve the dessert already?\nThose drunken dancers are waiting! '
Rachel	 (looking at her truffle) Look at it, isn\xc2\x92t it beautiful?'
Ross	 Yeah, yeah, what is it?'
Rachel	 It\xc2\x92s a truffle. It\xc2\x92s got all of these layers. First\nthere\xc2\x92s a layer of ladyfingers, then a layer of jam, then custard, which I made from\nscratch, [Joey and Ross make impressed faces] then raspberries, more ladyfingers, then\nbeef sauteed with peas and onions, [Joey and Ross look like something\xc2\x92s wrong.] then\na little more custard, and then bananas, and then I just put some whipped cream on top!'
Ross	 W-What was the one right before bananas?'
Rachel	 The beef? Yeah, that was weird to me, too. But then, y\xc2\x92know, I\nthought \xc2\x93well, there\xc2\x92s mincemeat pie,\xc2\x94 I mean that\xc2\x92s an English\ndessert, these people just put very strange things in their food, y\xc2\x92know. [To Joey]\nOh! by the way, can I borrow some Rum from your place?'
Joey	 Y-sure!'
Rachel	 (teasingly) And while I\xc2\x92m gone don\xc2\x92t you boys sneak\na taste.'
Joey and Ross	 (faking dissapointment) Okay.'
Ross	 Beef in a dessert?! I- no no no, there is no way!'
Joey	 I know, and only one layer of jam?! What is up with that?'
Ross	 Oh my God, the pages are stuck together!'
Joey	 (turning to Chandler in a scolding tone) Chandler!'
Ross	 Oh My God, she-she made half a English Trifle, and half a...Sheperd\xc2\x92s\nPie!'
Joey	 (sad) Oh man! Now she\xc2\x92s gonna start all over! We\xc2\x92re never gonna\nget to introduce the hot girls to the new world!'
Ross	 No, no, we will. We just won\xc2\x92t tell her she messed up.'
Joey	 Just let her serve the beef-custard thing?'
Ross	 Yeah, it\xc2\x92ll be like a funny Thanksgiving story!'
Joey	 (shrugging his shoulders to go along with it) Vomiting stories are\nfunny...'
Rachel	 Joey, God, your apartment is like a hundred degrees!'
Joey	 Did-did it make you wanna walk around in your underwear?'
Rachel	 No!'
Joey	 (frustrated) Still not hot enough!'
Phoebe	 Rachel?'
Rachel	 Yeah?'
Phoebe	 Okay, look at him. Look at those strong hands. Oh what I wouldn\xc2\x92t\ngive to be that can of (looks closer to see what Jack is drinking) condensed milk.'
Monica	 Mom, uh, Chandler was just saying how beautiful your sweater is.'
Mrs. Geller	 Oh, thank you Chandler! I just bought it.'
Chandler	 Oh, yes. Well it\xc2\x92s very beautiful. It\xc2\x92s cream-colored and\ntight [Realizes what he just said and looks worried. Monica and Ross also looked shocked.\nJudy and Jack give Chandler a very dirty look.] I don\xc2\x92t mean tight, I mean it\xc2\x92s\nnot too tight, not that I was looking at-[giving up all hope, he puts his head into his\nhands.]'
Mr. Geller	 What\xc2\x92s the matter with him?'
Mrs. Geller	 (whispers to Jack a little loudly) I think he\xc2\x92s stoned again.'
Chandler	 (shocked) What?'
Monica	 (shocked) What?'
Ross	 (worried) Dude, I need to talk to you a sec.'
Ross	 Okay, I think I might know why my parents don\xc2\x92t like you.'
Chandler	 You do? Why?'
Ross	 Okay, remember, we were young. Hey, Spring break, sophomore year, I got\nhigh in my bedroom and my parents walked in and smelled it and so I told them that you had\ngotten stoned and jumped out the window.'
Chandler	 What?! Why did you do that?'
Ross	 I don\xc2\x92t know, aheh, your\xc2\x92s was the first name that-that popped\ninto my head, I\xc2\x92m I\xc2\x92m sorry. I-I didn\xc2\x92t think it would matter.'
Chandler	 How could it not matter?!'
Ross	 How was I supposed to know we\xc2\x92d end up being friends after college,\nlet alone you-you would be living with my sister?'
Chandler	 What about all that \xc2\x93friends forever\xc2\x94 stuff?'
Ross	 I don\xc2\x92t know, I-I was all high. '

Monica	 Mom and dad just sent me in here to find out if you (points to Chandler)\nwere trying to get Ross stoned!'
Chandler	 Your parents caught Ross smoking pot in college and he blamed it on\nme!'
Monica	 Ross, I can\xc2\x92t believe you\xc2\x92d do that!'
Chandler	 The reason we haven\xc2\x92t told them we\xc2\x92re together is because\nthey hate me, okay? So will you fix this?'
Ross	 Okay, okay, I\xc2\x92ll tell \xc2\x91em it wasn\xc2\x92t Chandler who got high.\nNow who should I say it was?'
Monica	 You! It\xc2\x92s not like it\xc2\x92s a big deal! You-you don\xc2\x92t still\ndo it or anything!'
Ross	 Alright, alright, now-now who should I say tricked me into doing it?'
Monica	 Dad, please don\xc2\x92t pick your teeth out here! Alright, and if\nyou\xc2\x92re gonna put your feet up, why don\xc2\x92t you sit on the-'
Phoebe	 Monica, leave him alone!'
Joey	 (to Rachel) Will you hurry up? Did you not hear me before when I told you\nthat all of Janine\xc2\x92s friends are dancers?! And that they\xc2\x92re going to be drinking\nalot!?'
Rachel	 (sarcastically) No, I did, but tell me again, because it\xc2\x92s so\nromantic.'
Joey	 Well you\xc2\x92re whippin\xc2\x92 so slow! Can\xc2\x92t you do it any faster?'
Rachel	 Joey! Come on! I don\xc2\x92t wanna make any mistakes, alright? This is\nthe only dessert and if I screw it up everybody's gonna be like \xc2\x93Oh, remember that\nThanksgiving when Rachel screwed up the trifle?\xc2\x94"
Rachel	 So why don\xc2\x92t you just let me worry about making the trifle and you\njust worry about eating it, alright?'
Joey	 Oh I am!'
Monica	 Ross, if you don\xc2\x92t tell them, then I will!'
Ross	 Okay, fine!'
Joey	 Ross! Can I talk to you for a second?'
Ross	 Oh, uh, can it wait a second Joey? I have to tell my parents something. No\nit can\xc2\x92t? Okay.'
Joey	 Okay, look, I think we have to tell Rachel she messed up her dessert.'
Ross	 What?! What is with everybody? It\xc2\x92s Thanksgiving, not...Truth-Day!'
Joey	 Look, when everyone eats that...that...Banana-Meat thing, they\xc2\x92re all\ngonna\xc2\x92 make fun of her, do you want that?'
Ross	 Okay, okay, we\xc2\x92ll just get everyone to act like they like it.\nThat-that way noone makes fun of her and we still get to go to Sweet Potatoe Pie!\n(Referring to the dancers.)'
Joey	 (scolding) Dude, they\xc2\x92re not objects.'
Joey	 Just kiddin,\xc2\x92 I\xc2\x92ll talk to them, you distract Rach.'
Ross	 Hey Rach, can I talk to you outside for a second?'
Rachel	 Okay...'
Rachel	 What\xc2\x92s up, Ross?'
Ross	 So um...Thanksgiving. The holiday season is upon us, hm? '
Rachel	 Yeah!'
Ross	 And um...You look nice today.'
Rachel	 Oh no. No Ross, don\xc2\x92t do this.'
Ross	 What?'
Rachel	 I just- I don\xc2\x92t think us getting back together is a good idea.'
Ross	 (shocked) Eh?'
Rachel	 I thought this might happen today. Ross, I know the holidays can be\nrough. Y\xc2\x92know? And it\xc2\x92s probably really hard for you to be alone right now.'
Ross	 (cutting her off) You\xc2\x92re alone.'
Rachel	 No, I-I live with Phoebe. I mean you\xc2\x92re [pity-tone] alone,\nalone. And I just-it\xc2\x92s just not the time for us. I\xc2\x92m sorry.'
Ross	 (just trying to get out of the conversation) Ah well, can\xc2\x92t blame a\nguy for trying!'
Joey	 Oh and (Ross begins to open the door and Joey says some gibberish word to\nindicate to Ross that he\xc2\x92s not done yet. Ross closes the door again.) Okay, and uh if\nanyone needs help pretending to like it, I learned something in acting class, try uh,\nrubbing your stomach (Rubs his stomach) or uh, or saying \xc2\x93mmm\xc2\x94 and uh, oh oh!\nAnd smiling (Smiles while pretending to stir a bowl), okay?'
Chandler	 Yeah, I\xc2\x92m not gonna pay for those acting classes anymore.'
Joey	 Rachel, there you are! Come on, let\xc2\x92s serve that dessert already!'
Rachel	 Joey, you\xc2\x92re gonna have to stop rushing me, you know what? You\ndon\xc2\x92t get any dessert.'
Joey	 (happily) Really?'
Rachel	 No, I\xc2\x92m just kidding I would never do that to you! Okay, everybody,\nit\xc2\x92s trifle time!'
Phoebe	 So, now, Rach, this is a traditional English trifle, isn\xc2\x92t it?'
Rachel	 It sure is.'
Phoebe	 Wow. So then did you make it with beef or Eggplant?'
Rachel	 Beef.'
Phoebe	 I can\xc2\x92t have any. You know I don\xc2\x92t eat meat. (Faking\ndissapointment.) Ohhh no.'
Rachel	 Alright, Monica, I want you to have the first taste.'
Monica	 Really?'
Rachel	 Oh oh oh, wait! You only got whipped cream in there! Ya gotta take a\nbite with all the layers!'
Monica	 Okay.'
Rachel	 Op! Wait, you dropped a pea.'
Rachel	 Well?'
Monica	 (faking joy. Rubbing her stomach and smiling at the same time, like Joey\nsaid) Mmmm! It\xc2\x92s good!'
Rachel	 Really? How good? '
Monica	 It\xc2\x92s so good, that I feel really selfish about being the only one\nwho\xc2\x92s eating it, that I think we should have everyone taste how good it is.\nEspecially Ross.'
All	 (faking enjoyment) Mmm.'
Chandler	 (clearly lying and hating the dessert) Yeah, this is so good, that\nI\xc2\x92m gonna go enjoy it on the balcony so that I can enjoy the view whilst I enjoy my\ndessert.'
Mrs. Geller	 (lying) I\xc2\x92ve gotta call my friend Mary and tell her how good\nthis is, from Monica\xc2\x92s room.'
Mr. Geller	 (also lying) I\xc2\x92ll help you dial.'
Monica	 (again, lying) I\xc2\x92m gonna go into the bathroom so I can look at it\nin the mirror, as I eat it.'
Rachel	 Okay, now what was that all about? Is it-does it not taste good? Let me\ntry it.'
Ross	 Wha? No no! Ah! (Ross scarfs all of his trifle down in about a second. He\nlooks like he\xc2\x92s going to throw up.) (Lying) All gone! So good! Maybe Chandler has\nsome left.'
Ross	 It tastes like feet!'
Joey	 I like it.'
Ross	 Are you kidding?'
Joey	 What\xc2\x92s not to like? Custard? Good. Jam? Good. Meat? Gooooood.'
Rachel	 ...So a bird just grabbed it, and then tried to fly away with it and,\nand then just dropped it on the street?'
Chandler	 (lying) Yes, but if it\xc2\x92s any consolation, before the bird dropped\nit, he seemed to enjoy it.'
Phoebe	 Rachel, come here. (Rachel walks over to Phoebe. Chandler sits down on\nthe lounge-chair.) Okay, I was just starting to take my Thanksgiving nap, and I had\nanother dream about Jack.'
Rachel	 Oh, Phoebe, do I wanna hear this?'
Phoebe	 I dunno, let\xc2\x92s see! So, okay, I dreamt that we were gonna get\nmarried, and he left, becuz he had to go fight a fire. And, um, so okay, I went to a night\nclub, and I saw him making out with a girl.'
Rachel	 (humoring Phoebe) Oh my God, he dream-cheated on you!'
Phoebe	 Yeah, but then Jacques Cousteau came and he kicked his ass for betraying\nme! It was soo cool! Then, he took me diving and he introduced me to his pet seahorse,\nwho, by the way, was totally coming on to me, and please, that is not gonna happen.'
Mr. Geller	 Boy, I\xc2\x92m glad I wore the big belt today.'
Phoebe	 Five minutes ago, a line like that would\xc2\x92ve floored me. Now\nnothing. Well, not nothing, I am still a woman.'
Monica	 Ross? Let\xc2\x92s go.'
Ross	 Oh yeah, about telling Mom and Dad, I was thinking about maybe writing a\nletter.'
Monica	 Alright, you know what? That\xc2\x92s it. You\xc2\x92ve had your chance.'
Ross	 Wha-what?'
Monica	 (out loud, to her parents) Mom! Dad! Ross smoked pot in college!'
Mr. and Mrs. Geller	 What?!'
Ross	 (in a 5 year old\xc2\x92s tone) (To Monica) You are such a tattletale! Mom,\nDad, you remember that-that time you walked in my room and smelled marijuana?'
Mr. and Mrs. Geller	 Yes. (They look at Chandler angrily.)'
Ross	 Well I told you it was Chandler who was smoking the pot but it was me.\nI\xc2\x92m sorry.'
Mrs. Geller	 It was you?'
Monica	 And Dad, y\xc2\x92know that mailman that you got fired? He didn\xc2\x92t\nsteal your Playboys! Ross did!'
Ross	 Yeah, well, Hurricane Gloria didn\xc2\x92t break the porch swing, Monica\ndid!'
Monica	 Ross hasn\xc2\x92t worked at the museum for a year!'
Ross	 Monica and Chandler are living together!'
Monica	 Ross married Rachel in Vegas! And got divorced! Again!!!!'
Phoebe	 (joining in) I love Jacques Cousteau!'
Rachel	 (reading the recipe magazine, finally figuring out that...) I\nwasn\xc2\x92t supposed to put beef in the trifle!'
Joey	 (pounding the table) I wanna gooooooo!'
Mrs. Geller	 (rubbing her temples) That\xc2\x92s alot of information to get in in\nthirty seconds! Alright Joey, if wanna leave, just leave. Rachel, no you weren\xc2\x92t\nsupposed to put beef in the trifle. It did not taste good. Phoebe, I\xc2\x92m sorry, but I\nthink Jacques Cousteau is dead. (Phoebe makes a sad face.) Monica, why you felt you had to\nhide the fact that you were in an important relationship is beyond me.'
Mr. Geller	 And we kinda figured about the porch swing.'
Mrs. Geller	 Ross, drugs? Divorced? Again?'
Mr. Geller	 What happened son?'
Ross	 I-I uh, I got tricked into all those things!'
Mrs. Geller	 Chandler! You\xc2\x92ve been Ross\xc2\x92s best friend all these years,\nstuck by him during the drug problems. (Ross gets disgusted.) And now you\xc2\x92ve taken on\nMonica as well. Well, I don\xc2\x92t know what to say. You\xc2\x92re a wonderful human being.'
Chandler	 Thank you!'
Mr. Geller	 No! Thank you! (Hugs Chandler) Monica, and Ross! I don\xc2\x92t know\nwhat I\xc2\x92m gonna do about the two of you!'
Chandler	 (In a parent-like tone) I\xc2\x92ll talk to them! '

Rachel	 You guys! It was bananas, cream, and beef! I-I just cannot believe that\nyou ate that so that I wouldn\xc2\x92t feel bad!'
Monica	 Well actually, I-I didn\xc2\x92t eat mine. It\xc2\x92s still in the\nbathroom.'
Joey	 No it isn\xc2\x92t, I ate that.'
Mrs. Geller	 (pointing to herself and Jack) Well we left ours in Monica\xc2\x92s\nbedroom.'
Joey	 Nope, got it and I got yours (Pointing to Jack) too. '
