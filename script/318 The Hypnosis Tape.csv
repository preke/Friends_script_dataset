Monica	 (to Joey) What\xc2\x92s so funny?'
Joey	 Oh, nothing, no. It\xc2\x92s an acting exercise, I\xc2\x92m practising my fake\nlaugh.'
Monica	 Oh. (she laughs)'
Joey	 What-what\xc2\x92s so funny?'
Gunther	 (to Chandler) Oh, no-no, no-no-no, there\xc2\x92s none of that in here.'
Chandler	 Oh come on man! At least let me finish this last one.'
Gunther	 Okay, but only if you give me a drag.'
Chandler	 Okay.'
Gunther	 Oh dark mother, once again I suckle at your smokey tit. (hands Chandler\nback the cigarette.)'
Chandler	 No-no, why don\xc2\x92t you hang on to that one.'
Chandler	 Okay, that\xc2\x92s like the least fun game ever.'
Rachel	 Well, I\xc2\x92m really sick of your smoking, so I brought something that\nis going to help you quit. (hands him an audio cassette)'
Chandler	 Oh. (takes the cassette and puts it on his arm like the stop smoking\npatch, and it falls off.) Nope, that patch is no good. (Joey and Monica both do their fake\nlaughs.)'
Rachel	 Come on, it\xc2\x92s a hypnosis tape. This woman at work used it for two\nweeks straight and she hasn\xc2\x92t smoked since.'
Ross	 Pffhah.'
Rachel	 (to Ross) What\xc2\x92s your problem?'
Ross	 Nothing, it\xc2\x92s just that hypnosis is beyond crap.'
Rachel	 Ross, I watched you get hypnotised in Atlantic City.'
Ross	 Hey, that guy did not hypnotise me! Okay.'
Rachel	 Oh right, \xc2\x91cause you always pull your pants down at the count of\nthree and play Wipe-out on your butt cheeks.'
Phoebe	 All right, y'know forget hypnosis. The way to quit smoking is you have\nto dance naked in a field of heather, and then bath in the sweat of six healthy young men."
Chandler	 Or what my Father called Thursday night.'

Ross	 Here you go.'
Rachel	 Oh, y'know what, I didn\xc2\x92t want cinnamon on this."
Ross	 Sorry. (To remedy that, Ross scoops the cinnamon off of the top with his\nhand.)'
Frank	 (entering) Hi!'
Phoebe	 Oh my God!! '
Frank	 Hi!'
Phoebe	 Frank! Hi!'
Frank	 How are you?'
Phoebe	 What are you doing here?'
Frank	 Oh, well y'know, I would\xc2\x92ve called but I lost your phone number and\nthen ah, my Mom locked me out of the house so I couldn\xc2\x92t find it. And then, I tried\nto find a pay phone, and ah, the receiver was cut off. So..."
Phoebe	 What happened?'
Frank	 Ah, oh, the ah, vandalism.'
Phoebe	 But, also, what happened between you and your Mom?'

Frank	 Okay, cool, all right, she just ah, parking the truck. (to Joey) I\xc2\x92m\ngonna, I\xc2\x92m gonna get my ah, my fianc\xc3\xa9e man!'
Chandler	 Y'know, I would\xc2\x92ve bet good money that he\xc2\x92d be the first one\nof us to get married."
Phoebe	 Yeah, isn\xc2\x92t it fantastic?'
Monica	 Yeah, ah, but Pheebs don\xc2\x92t you think he\xc2\x92s a little young to\nget married?'
Phoebe	 What, he\xc2\x92s 18.'
Ross	 Exactly, it\xc2\x92ll be illegal for him to drink at his own bachelor party.'
Joey	 Yeah, or-or to get a hooker.'
Chandler	 Always illegal Joe.'
Frank	 (entering with his fianc\xc3\xa9e Alice, who is obviously much, much older than\nhe is) Hey! Hey! This is ah, my fianc\xc3\xa9e, Mrs. Knight. (he points out Phoebe to her)'
Alice	 Y'know it-it\xc2\x92s funny, um, Frank told me so much about you, but your\nnot how I pictured you at all."
Phoebe	 Yeah, I\xc2\x92m a big surprise.'
Monica	 So, um, how-how did you guys meet?'
Frank	 Well um, I was in ah Mrs. Knight\xc2\x92s ah, I mean Alice, sorry, Alice, I\nalways do that. I was in her ah, Home Ec class.'
Alice	 And he was my best student.'
Frank	 Yeah, she was my best teacher. '
Alice	 Ohhh. (They embrace in a very passionate kiss.)'
Chandler	 If that doesn\xc2\x92t keep kids in school, what will?'
Ross	 And so now you guys are gonna be married?'
Alice	 Yeah. Y'know we-we talked about just living together, but um, we want to\nhave kids right away."
Rachel	 Oh my God!! Great!'
Phoebe	 Wow, kids. Frank, are you sure you\xc2\x92re ready for that?'
Frank	 I mean, how hard can it be? Y'know, I mean, y'know, babies, y'know who\ndoesn\xc2\x92t want babies right? And besides y'know, I never had a Dad around, and ah,\nnow-now I always will, \xc2\x91cause y'know, it\xc2\x92ll be me. Right?"
Alice	 Y'know, I mean, really we do realise that there\xc2\x92s an age difference\nbetween us."
Phoebe	 Oh good! Okay. \xc2\x91Cause you were acting like you didn\xc2\x92t.'
Alice	 Oh no, but when it comes to love, what does age matter?'
Hypnosis Tape	 You are falling fast asleep. Deeper. Deeper. Deeper. You are now\ncompletely asleep. You don\xc2\x92t need to smoke. Cigarettes don\xc2\x92t control you. You\nare a strong, confident woman, who does not need to smoke. A strong, confident woman.'
Monica	 And y'know what, I just realised, in the last year I\xc2\x92ve only gone\nout with two guys, Richard and Julio. You gotta help me out here, you gotta set me up, you\ngotta get me back in the game."
Rachel	 Well, that shouldn\xc2\x92t be a problem. I mean I work in fashion and all\nI meet are eligible straight men.'
Monica	 (to a customer) Pete, can I get you something else?'
Pete	 Yeah, a slice of cheesecake and-and a date if you\xc2\x92re given\xc2\x92\n\xc2\x91em out.'
Monica	 Haven\xc2\x92t you and I covered that topic?'
Pete	 Hmm, come on, you just said to her that you\xc2\x85.'
Monica	 Aww, the only reason you want to go out with me because my blond wig,\nand the big boobs, and the fact that I serve you food.'
Pete	 Well, if that were true, I\xc2\x92d dating my Aunt Ruth. And the two times\nwe went out were just plain awkward. (to Rachel) Come on, you think she should go out with\nme, don\xc2\x92t you?'
Rachel	 (laughs) Well, I mean, are you sure you want to go out with her? I mean\nthat ain\xc2\x92t a pretty picture in the morning, y\xc2\x92know what I mean. That wig all in\ndisarray, and boobs flung over the night stand, y'know. "
Monica	 I mean really, think about it.'
Pete	 Ho-ho, I will.'
Phoebe	 No, I know, I know, that this is Frank\xc2\x92s life, (walks behind them,\nthey turn around in the leather chairs to face her) y'know. Y'know, I don\xc2\x92t want to\nbe all judgmental, y'know, but this is sick, it\xc2\x92s sick and wrong!"
Ross	 Pheebs, what, is it the age thing?'
Phoebe	 No-no, oh, I\xc2\x92m fine with the age thing y'know, until it starts\nsticking it\xc2\x92s tongue down my little brother\xc2\x92s throat! "
Joey	 Pheebs, he seems to enjoy it.'
Phoebe	 But, I mean, do you think he\xc2\x92s gonna enjoy it when he\xc2\x92s up to\nhis elbows in the diapers from all the babies they have to have right away?! This is not\nfair to Frank, (she walks behind them again, and hey again turn to follow her) and\nit-it\xc2\x92s not fair to the babies, and y'know what, it\xc2\x92s not good home economics."
Joey	 Well, have-have you told him how you feel?'
Phoebe	 Yes. Not out loud.'
Ross	 Pheebs, if you don\xc2\x92t tell him, soon he\xc2\x92s gonna be married, and\nthen you\xc2\x92re gonna hate yourself.'
Phoebe	 Yeah, but if I do tell him, then he\xc2\x92s gonna hate myself. I mean\nlook at him and his Mom, I can\xc2\x92t. (pause) But, you guys can, please you gotta talk\nhim out of it.'
Ross and Joey	 No-no-no-no-no. (They start to turn away, but Phoebe stops them,\nand turns them back to face her.)'
Phoebe	 Come on, you guys, you have nothing to lose, I have everything to lose.\nDo you want me to lose everything? Everything?!'
Ross and Joey	 No.'
Phoebe	 Okay, I\xc2\x92m gonna go get Frank. (exits)'
Joey	 So, we\xc2\x92re walking down the street and I turn to you and I say,\n\xc2\x93Hey, let\xc2\x92s go hang out at Totally Nude Nudes,\xc2\x94 remember? And then, and\nthen, you turn to me and say, \xc2\x93Nah, let\xc2\x92s just hang out at your place.\xc2\x94\nWell, that was a nice move dumb ass. '
Rachel	 I think you should definitely go out with this guy.'
Monica	 Nah, he doesn\xc2\x92t do anything for me.'
Rachel	 Monica, last Saturday night, what happened on Walker

Chandler	 (reading the check) Pete Becker. Pete\xc2\x85 (quickly grabs a magazine\nand opens it up to show her a picture) (pointing to the picture) Is this him?'

Rachel	 Oh my God, I can\xc2\x92t believe this is a real $20,000 check, oh this is\njust so exciting.'
Monica	 Or incredibly offensive.'
Rachel	 Oh yeah, sure, that too.'
Chandler	 (to the girls who are staring at him) What?'
Ross	 All we\xc2\x92re saying is don\xc2\x92t rush into anything.'
Joey	 Yeah, come on, think about it. You\xc2\x92re 18, okay, she\xc2\x92s 44, when\nyou\xc2\x92re 36, she\xc2\x92s gonna be 88.'
Frank	 What, you don\xc2\x92t think I know that?'

Frank	 You don\xc2\x92t have it anymore?'
Ross	 No, I ah, I slept with someone else.'
Frank	 Okay, so wait, all right, so how does that make things better?'
Ross	 It didn\xc2\x92t.'
Frank	 Okay, so what you used to have with Rachel, is what I\xc2\x92ve got with\nAlice.'
Joey	 Now, wh-what, what is that like?'
Frank	 It\xc2\x92s so cool man, it\xc2\x92s so, it\xc2\x92s just \xc2\x91cause being\nwith her is so much better than like not being with her.'
Ross	 Yeah, yeah.'
Joey	 (to Ross) Why can\xc2\x92t I find that?'
Ross	 Don\xc2\x92t ask me, I had it and I blew it!'
Joey	 Well, I want it!'

Ross	 I\xc2\x92m the ring bearer.'

Phoebe	 Hi! Oh, Alice, hi! Thanks. I\xc2\x92m so glad you could come, \xc2\x91cause\nI\xc2\x92ve got a real umm, Home Ec emergency. (Points to the table cloth, which has a huge\nmustard stain on it.)'
Alice	 Oh my God, who died on this?!'
Phoebe	 Yeah, I know. It\xc2\x92s a real mustard-tastrophe. Can you help me?'
Alice	 Absolutely. Okay, first we\xc2\x92ll start with a little club soda and\nsalt, and then if that doesn\xc2\x92t work we can go back to\xc2\x85'
Phoebe	 Y'know what, forget it. It\xc2\x92s ruined. "
Alice	 Oh no-no, never say that. If we can\xc2\x92t get it out then we can cut\naround the stain, add a little lace, you make a stylish throw.'
Phoebe	 Or instead, maybe you could just not marry my brother Frank.'
Pete	 Okay, that\xc2\x92s great, but can we make it smaller? Can we make it fit on\nthe head of a pin? I love when we make things fit on the head of a pin.'
All	 Got it. Yeah all right. Yeah, okay.'

Monica	 Seriously, what is this supposed to mean?'
Pete	 Well, y\xc2\x92know, I never know how much to tip.'
Monica	 You\xc2\x92re supposed to double the tax. Not double the tax of Romania. I\nmean, what\xc2\x92s-what\xc2\x92s the deal? Are you, are you trying to buy me? Is this the way\nyou get girls to go out with you?'
Employee	 Umm, I\xc2\x92m still here.'
Pete	 (turns off the TV) You\xc2\x92re taking this all wrong. Because, if I\ndidn\xc2\x92t leave you that tip, you wouldn\xc2\x92t of come down here, we wouldn\xc2\x92t be\nhaving this argument, and there wouldn\xc2\x92t be this ah, heat between us.'
Monica	 What?!'
Pete	 Come on, you gotta admit that our relationship is ah, is hitting a new\nlevel now. \xc2\x91Cause you used to be like the chef, and I was the customer, and now\nwe\xc2\x92re like this-this couple that fights.'
Monica	 Okay, umm, you\xc2\x92re a loon.'
Pete	 Look, forget the check, okay. (rips up the check) I like you. I think\nyou\xc2\x92re great. Come on, what do you say?'

Phoebe	 Okay. Whoa, sorry. Why were you just like all in the dark?'
Frank	 Oh well, um, your, your laundry just smelled so good, that I thought\nI\xc2\x92d curl up in it. Is that all right?'
Phoebe	 Oh, yeah, sure. So, how was your day?'
Frank	 Oh, well just probably the worst one since I\xc2\x92ve been alive.'
Phoebe	 What umm, what happened?'
Frank	 Umm, Alice ah, she ah, called it off.'
Phoebe	 Oh no. Did umm, did she say why?'
Frank	 Uh, no, not really, just that I was too young, y'know, but I don\xc2\x92t\nsee how I could all of the sudden be too young, \xc2\x91cause I\xc2\x92m older than I was when\nwe first got together."
Phoebe	 Yeah, yeah, no, I don\xc2\x92t, I don\xc2\x92t know. But, y'know what, maybe\nit\xc2\x92s just all for the best?"
Frank	 Yeah, if the best is like unbelievable pain!'
Phoebe	 Oh, sweetie, oh. (hugs him)'
Frank	 Y'know, I just was finally happy y'know. For the first time in my life!\nAfter my Dad left me, and then, and then getting arrested for stealing those birds, and\nthen, and then the whole punctured lung thing! I can, it\xc2\x92s still really hard to take\ndeep breaths in cold weather, but with Alice all that stuff kinda went away. And now\nit\xc2\x92s, and now it\xc2\x92s gone and I don\xc2\x92t know why!"
Phoebe	 Uh, well I can tell you why. It\xc2\x92s, it\xc2\x92s because of me. But,\ny'know what, I only did it because I love you. Okay?"
Frank	 What?'
Phoebe	 Umm, well I, I kinda had a little chat with Alice, and I sort of made\nher see why you two shouldn\xc2\x92t be together, y'know. And you\xc2\x92re gonna see it to,\none day, you really, really will."
Frank	 Wait a minute, wait, this is because of you?'
Phoebe	 Okay.'
Frank	 Well, you, wait no, my Mother didn\xc2\x92t want us to be together, but the\nworst thing she ever did was tie me to the porch. '
Phoebe	 Okay, but.'
Frank	 Wait, y'know what, I-I came to you because I thought you\xc2\x92d\nunderstand! Oh no!! Y'know, I would storm out of here right now if-if I had some money, or\na place to go\xc2\x85"
Rachel	 Oh my God! The millionaire\xc2\x92s here!'
Chandler	 (in a feminine way) Oh my God! (and he jumps all around)'
Monica	 Guys, please, I\xc2\x92m just gonna have dinner with him. Okay?'
Chandler	 Okay, okay, just because he buys you dinner, does not mean you owe him\nanything.'
Monica	 I know!!'
Chandler	 Okay, then get the lobster!'
Monica	 (opening the door) (to Pete) Hey!'
Pete	 Hi.'

Monica	 Oh, that\xc2\x92s sounds great.'
Pete	 I know a great little place.'
Pete	 You\xc2\x92re, hey, you\xc2\x92re not paying for the pizza!'
Monica	 Oh come on, it\xc2\x92s only fair, you paid for the flight. Now is, is\nthat enough lire?'
Pete	 Ahh, I\xc2\x92d throw another thousand on that.'
Monica	 Why, how much is that?'
Pete	 That\xc2\x92s about 60 cents.'
Joey	 Every night!! '
Hypnosis Tape	 You do not need to smoke. Cigarettes don\xc2\x92t control you. You\nare a strong, confident woman, who does not need to smoke. A strong, confident woman, who\ndoes not need to smoke. (Joey walks out smiling to himself.)'
Phoebe	 Hey, Frank. Look, okay, I know that you think I did like this totally\nevil thing, but I so didn\xc2\x92t. There\xc2\x92s someone here who can explain this better\nthan I can.'
Alice	 Hi Frank.'
Frank	 Hi, Mrs. Knight.'
Alice	 Phoebe\xc2\x92s right Frank. I know it\xc2\x92s hard to hear, but it\nwould\xc2\x92ve been wrong to go through with it. I-I-I was being selfish, even though we,\nwe want the same things now, in the future we may not. (to Phoebe) Is that it, is that\nwhat it is?'
Phoebe	 Yeah, but not just that.'
Alice	 Right, not just that. Umm, even though we love each other as much as we\ndo, none the less\xc2\x85'
Phoebe	 None the less.'
Alice	 None the less. Umm, you\xc2\x92re too young to, to really know what you\nwant. (They embrace in a passionate kiss.)'
Phoebe	 That\xc2\x92s right, exactly. (sees them) All right, it\xc2\x92s a good bye\nkiss, that\xc2\x92s good. (Frank picks Alice up and they move to the couch) Bye-bye. (They\nboth lie down on the couch and start to make out.) Okay, no, the important thing is that\nyou see what I\xc2\x92m saying, y'know, just y'know, this is clearly wrong. (They ignore\nher) Okay, I\xc2\x92ve decided I\xc2\x92m gonna let this happen! Okay, can I just get my\npurse? (She reaches in and Alice moans) Okay, all right, good. (leaves)."

Hypnosis Tape	 Cigarette\xc2\x92s don\xc2\x92t control you. You are a strong,\nconfident woman, who does not need to smoke. '
Joey	 (He\xc2\x92s recorded his voice on the tape) Joey\xc2\x92s your best friEnd.\nYou want to make him a cheese sandwich everyday. (he laughs) And you also want to buy him\nhundreds of dollars worth of pants. '
