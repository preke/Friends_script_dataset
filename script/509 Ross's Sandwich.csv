Phoebe	 What am I sitting on?'
Chandler	 Top of the world? Dock of the bay? (He tries to think of another but\ncan't) I'm out."
Phoebe	 (taking something out of the couch) Ew-eww!! Undies! '
Rachel	 All right! Who's are they? Who's are they?"
Ross	 Well, they're not mine!"
Chandler	 Well, they're Joey's! They gotta be Joey's!"
Joey	 Yeah, they're mine."
Chandler	 See? They're Joey's! J-J-J-J-J-Joey's!"
Ross	 Why are they here?'
Joey	 I don't know uhh\xc2\x85 (Pause as he thinks about it.) Well, I'm Joey.\nYeah, I'm disgusting, I take my underwear off in other people's homes."
Rachel	 Well, get 'em out of here! What's wrong with you?"
Chandler	 Yeah!'
Monica	 Yeah!'
Rachel	 (waving them in his face) Take 'em! (Joey makes a noise and jumps out of\nthe way.) Joey, you can touch them! They're your underwear."
Joey	 (reluctantly taking them) Chandler? A word.'
Joey	 That's it! I'm tired of covering for you two! This has got to stop!\n(Realizes he still has the underwear in his hand.) Ahh! (Throws them towards Chandler's\nroom.) And tighty-whiteys! What are you, 8?"
Monica	 (entering) Thank you Joey, thank you so much!'
Joey	 Oh hey, no, you're not welcome. Okay, look, I hate this! You guys keep\nembarrassing me! (To Monica) Yesterday, Rachel found your razor in our bathroom and I\ndidn't know what to say, so I said it was mine and-and that I was playing a woman in a\nplay. And one thing led to another and (He puts his leg on the chair and pulls up his\npants leg to reveal that he now has shaved legs.)"
Monica	 (inspecting his leg) Wow! And around the ankles, y'know that is a tough\nspot."
Joey	 Yeah, it was! All right, listen, I can't\xc2\x85"
Chandler	 (interrupting him) All this lying has been hard on us too.'
Joey	 Oh-oh, yeah-yeah, I bet all the sex makes it easier!'
Chandler	 Well, yeah actually.'
Monica	 We'll try to be more careful okay? It's just that, we don't want\neveryone to know because this is going really well, and maybe the reason it's going really\nwell is because it's a secret."
Chandler	 I know it sounds really weird, but we're just so bad at relationships."
Monica	 We are! Help us!'
Chandler	 Help!'
Joey	 All right! But, (To Monica) you do it with me once.'
Monica	 Joey!'
Joey	 Didn't think so."

Monica	 Hey, Phoebe!'
Chandler	 Hi, Pheebs!'
Rachel	 Hey, Pheebs!'
Joey	 Hey, Pheebs!'
Rachel	 What are you reading?'
Phoebe	 Umm, Wethering Heights. I'm taking a literature class at the New\nSchool and I have to finish it for the first session tomorrow."
Chandler	 I didn't know you were taking a class. That is so cool."
Phoebe	 Yeah! Well, I really liked that Lamaze class I took! Y'know and this\ntime I thought I'd go for something, y'know a little more intellectual, with a less\npainful final exam."
Rachel	 Honey that sounds like fun.'
Phoebe	 Yeah! Ooh, you should come with me! Oh yeah, then I'd have someone to\nsit with!"
Rachel	 Okay.'
Phoebe	 Yeah! Okay\xc2\x97ooh, but are you going to have time to read it?'
Rachel	 Oh, I read that in high school.'
Phoebe	 This is going to be so much fun! Okay-shhh, I have to finish.'
Ross	 (entering, depressed) Hi.'
Joey	 What's wrong buddy?"
Ross	 Someone at work ate my sandwich!'
Chandler	 Well, what did the police say?'
Ross	 My Thanksgiving leftover sandwich. I can't believe someone ate it!"
Chandler	 Ross, it's just a sandwich!"
Ross	 Just a sandwich? Look, I am 30 years old, I'm about to be divorced twice\nand I just got evicted! That sandwich was the only good thing going on in my life! Someone\nate the only good thing going on in my life!"
Monica	 Okay, look, I-I have enough stuff for one more sandwich, I mean I was\ngoing to eat it myself, but (motions that he can have it.)'
Ross	 (quietly) That-that would be incredible. Thank you so much. I-I still\ncan't believe someone ate it!! I mean, look, I left a note and everything. "
Chandler	 (reading) Knock-knock. Who's there? Ross Geller's lunch. Ross Geller's\nlunch, who? Ross Geller's lunch, please don't take me. Okay?"
Joey	 I'm surprised you didn't go home wearing your lunch."
Phoebe	 Okay, look you wanna hold onto your food? You gotta scare people off. I\nlearned that living on the street.'
Ross	 Really?! So what would you say Pheebs? Stuff like uh, "Keep your\nmitts off my grub?"'
Chandler	 Say Ross, when you picture Phoebe living on the street, is she\nsurrounded by the entire cast of Annie?'
Phoebe	 Okay, this will keep them away from your stuff. (Writes him a note and\nthe gang reads it.)'
All	 Whoa! Ohh!!'
Monica	 Phoebe, you are a bad ass!'
Phoebe	 Someday I'll, tell you about the time I stabbed the cop."
Monica	 Phoebe?'
Phoebe	 Well, he stabbed me first!!'
Rachel	 (To Phoebe) Sorry I'm late, but I left late."
Phoebe	 Okay.'
Rachel	 So Pheebs, what is the book about?'
Phoebe	 I thought you said you read it in high school.'
Rachel	 Well yeah, but then I remembered I started it and there was this pep\nrally and I was, I was on top of the pyramid but anyway\xc2\x97umm, what is this book about?'
Phoebe	 Okay, umm, it's this tragic love story between Cathy and Heathcliff and\numm, it takes place on like these really creepy mores in England. Which I think\nrepresents the wildness of Heathcliff's character. I totally get symbolism."
The Teacher	 How would you characterize the theme of this book, uh let's see\nhere (looks at his attendance sheet), Rachel Green?"
Rachel	 Umm, well I would have to say that it's a, it's tragic love story."
The Teacher	 Well, that's sort of a given, but yes. Anyone else?"
Rachel	 Oh-oh-oh, symbolism! And uh, the-the uh, wildness of the mores, which I\nthink is-is mirrored in the wildness of Heathcliff's character."
The Teacher	 Excellent! What Rachel has shrewdly observed here\xc2\x85'
Phoebe	 (To Rachel) You completely stole my answer!'
Rachel	 Well, honey that was pretty obvious.'
Phoebe	 Well how would you know?! You didn't even read it!"
The Teacher	 What do you think? You in the blue shirt.'
Phoebe	 I think that uh, yours is a question with many answers.'
The Teacher	 Would ya care to venture one?'
Phoebe	 Would you care to venture one?'
The Teacher	 Are you just repeating what I'm saying?"
Phoebe	 Are you just repeating what I'm saying?"
The Teacher	 All right, let's move on."
Phoebe	 Okay then.'
Phoebe	 Yeah but why didn't you just say that you didn't read the book?!"
Rachel	 Be-because I didn't want him to think I was stupid! I mean, that was\nreally embarrassing what happened to you!"
Ross	 (entering) Phoebe! '
Phoebe	 Yeah?'
Ross	 Phoebe! You're note, amazing! Not only did no one touch my sandwich, but\npeople at work are actually afraid of me. Yeah, a guy called me mental! Mental Geller,\nyeah, I always wanted a cool nickname like that."
Monica	 Yeah, the best you got in high school was Wet Pants Geller.'
Ross	 That was the water fountain! Okay?! Anyway, people are writing reports for\nme, uh pushing back deadlines to meet my schedule, I'm telling you, you get tough with\npeople you can get anything you want. (Joey walks by with a cup of coffee.) Hey Tribbiani,\ngive me that coffee! Now!"
Cynthia	 God, this was really fun! I've been wondering if you were going to ask\nme out."
Joey	 So you uh, still wondering?'
Cynthia	 No, we just went out.'
Joey	 You're smart. I like that."
Cynthia	 Oh, candles! (Notices something.) What is that? A blanket? A video\ncamera? Oh my God! (As she storms out, Rachel returns and overhears the conversation.)'
Joey	 Oh no-no-no-no, wait-wait-wait!!'
Cynthia	 I can't believe you thought that you were going to video tape us having\nsex on the first date! (She storms away and Rachel enters to confront Joey.)"
Joey	 Hiya.'
Rachel	 Joey, is what she just said umm\xc2\x97Oh my God. (Looks around the room.)\nYou were actually gonna\xc2\x85 (Chandler picks this moment to return to the living room.)\n(Rachel stares in shock.)'
Chandler	 What is going on here?'
Rachel	 And with Chandler in the next room. What are you, what are you sick?'
Joey	 I'm Joey. I mean, I'm disgusting. I make low-budget adult films. (Points\nat Chandler, angrily.)"

Joey	 You guys promised you'd be more careful! I mean, come on! The good\nJoey name is being dragged through the mud here!"
Monica	 We're so sorry."
Chandler	 Yeah.'
Joey	 Well, I'm telling everyone about you! That's the only way to explain the\nunderwear and the video camera that doesn't make me look like a pig!"
Chandler	 No-no, wait! There's got to be a better explanation. You can tell them\nyou had to make an adult film for your (Thinks) adult film class."
Joey	 Yeah, I like that. But no-no, how does that explain why Rachel found my\nunderwear at your place?'
Chandler	 Oh\xc2\x97I don't know."
Joey	 Well, get ready to come out of the non-gay closet!'
Monica	 Okay, just wait, please. I promise we'll come up with something. Just\ngive us a little more time."
Joey	 All right. Hey, but it better make me look really, really good. (Starts\nfor his room.) Oh, and another thing, the video camera? Nice!!'
Dr. Leedbetter	 Umm, Ross. May I have a word with you?'
Ross	 Yeah, of course, Donald.'
Dr. Leedbetter	 We've been getting reports of some very angry behavior on your\npart."
Ross	 What?!'
Dr. Leedbetter	 Threatening letters, refusal to meet deadlines, apparently\npeople now call you mental.'
Ross	 (Proudly) Yeah.'
Dr. Leedbetter	 We want you to speak to a psychiatrist. '
Ross	 Oh no, you-you don't understand. Ugh, this is so silly. Umm, this is all\nbecause of a sandwich."
Dr. Leedbetter	 (laughs) A sandwich?'
Ross	 Yeah. You see my-my sister makes these amazing turkey sandwiches. Her\nsecret is, she puts a, an extra slice of gravy soaked bread in the middle; I call it the\nMoist Maker. Anyway, I-I put my sandwich in the fridge over here\xc2\x85 '
Dr. Leedbetter	 (laughs) Oh, you know what?'
Ross	 What?'
Dr. Leedbetter	 I-I'm sorry. I, I-I-I believe I ate that."
Ross	 You ate my sandwich?'
Dr. Leedbetter	 It was a simple mistake. It could happen to anyone.'
Ross	 (getting upset) Oh-oh really? Did you confuse it with your own turkey\nsandwich with a Moist Maker?'
Dr. Leedbetter	 No.'
Ross	 Do you perhaps seeing a note on top of it?'
Dr. Leedbetter	 There may have been a-a joke or a limerick of some kind.'
Ross	 (getting angry) That said it was my sandwich?!'
Dr. Leedbetter	 Now-now calm down. Come look in my office, some of it my still\nbe in the trash.'
Ross	 (jumping to his feet in anger) What?'
Dr. Leedbetter	 Well, it was quite large. I-I-I-I-I had to throw most of it\naway.'
Ross	 You-you-you-you (trying to remain in control) threw my sandwich away!'
Ross	 (losing control, we hear him shout outside) MY SANDWICH?!!!'
Ross	 MY SANDWICH!!!!!! (Ross's scream scares a flight of pigeons away.)"
Rachel	 Hi!'
Phoebe	 Hi!'
Rachel	 (sitting down) So umm, what's this book about?"
Phoebe	 You didn't read this one either?!"
Rachel	 Well, I was gonna, but I accidentally read something else.'
Phoebe	 What?'
Rachel	 Vogue! Hey, so tell me about this Jane Eyre woman.'
Phoebe	 No! You should've read it yourself!"
Rachel	 Come on Phoebe! Don\xc2\x92t be such a goodie-goodie!'
Phoebe	 Fine! Okay, all right, so Jane Eyre, first of all, you'd think she's a\nwoman, but she's not. She's a cyborg. "
Rachel	 A cyborg?! Isn't that like a robot?!"
Phoebe	 Yeah, this book was light years ahead of its time.'
The Teacher	 (entering) Sorry I'm late. Let's get started. So, what did\neverybody think about Jane Eyre?"
Phoebe	 Umm, Rachel and I were just discussing it and she had some very\ninteresting insights.'
The Teacher	 Well, go ahead Rachel.'
Rachel	 Uh, thank you Phoebe. Umm, well, what struck me most when reading Jane\nEyre was uh, how the book was so ahead of its time.'
The Teacher	 If you're talking about feminism, I think you're right."
Rachel	 Yeah, well, feminism yes, but also the robots.'
Chandler	 Hey.'
Monica	 Hey. Okay, so umm, since that video camera thing didn't work out uh, I\nthought that I would give you just a little preview. (Hands him a Polaroid.)"
Chandler	 (gasps) You're naked in this picture!"
Monica	 I know.'
Chandler	 Ross?'
Ross	 (in a stupor) Hey Chandler. (Sees Monica.) Monica!'
Monica	 Ross, are you okay?'
Ross	 I'm fine! I saw a psychiatrist at work today."
Monica	 Why?!'
Ross	 On account of my rage.'
Chandler	 Which I may say, right now, is out of control.'
Ross	 He gave me a pill for it.'
Monica	 A pill?'
Ross	 Uh-huh. Well, when the psychiatrist told me I had to take a leave of\nabsence because I yelled at my boss I started to get worked up again, so he offered me a\ntranquilizer. And I thought was a good idea so, I took it.'
Monica	 Wait a minute, they're making you take time off work?"
Chandler	 And you're okay with that?"
Ross	 I don't know. It's going to be weird not having a job for a while, but I,\nI definitely don't care about my sandwich."
Rachel	 (entering, angrily) Ugh, that was so embarrassing! I can't believe you\nlet me go on and on like that!"
Phoebe	 (smiling) I'm sorry. It was just so funny when you started comparing Jane\nEyre to Robocop. "
Rachel	 That was not funny!'
Phoebe	 Well, I snapped! Okay? You weren't taking the class seriously."
Rachel	 Phoebe, come on! What is the big deal? I thought this was going to be\nsomething we could do together! Y'know, I thought it would be fun!"
Phoebe	 Well, yeah! Fun is good, but y'know I also wanted to learn. Y'know,\npeople are always talking about what they learned in high school and I never went to high\nschool."
Rachel	 Ohh. Oh, so you really wanted to learn. Yeah, y'know, Pheebs I just\nwanted to have fun. Ohh, you know who you should go with?"
Monica	 (yelling and waving her hand in the air) I know! I know! I know!'
The Teacher	 Monica, you asked the question.'
Rachel	 (sees the picture) Oh my God! That's Monica!!"
Joey	 Oh no-no-no! No-no-no-no-no-no-no!'
Rachel	 You get away from me!! You sick, sick, sick, sick-o!!'
Ross	 (entering, with the rest of the gang) What's going on?"
Rachel	 Joey has got a secret peephole!'
Chandler	 (Sees the picture) Oh no! No! No! No! (Monica gasps as well.)'
Rachel	 Yes! He has a naked picture of Monica! He takes naked pictures of us!\nAnd then he eats chicken and looks at them!'
Rachel	 Look! (Shows Ross the picture.)'
Ross	 (covering his eyes) Dude! That's my sister! (She shows the rest of the\ngang.)"
Monica	 (grabbing the picture) Give me that!'
Phoebe	 All right, wait! Just wait. Everybody just calm down. Okay? Let's give\nour friend Joey a chance to explain why he's such a big pervert!"
Joey	 No! I am not a pervert! Okay? It's just\xc2\x85 I just\xc2\x85\nKinda\xc2\x85"
Chandler	 All right, look! Look. I think I can explain this.'
Joey	 Thank you!'
Chandler	 Joey's a sex addict. "
Joey	 What?!! (He turns around and stares at Chandler who's silently pleading\nwith Joey to go along with it.) No I'm not!!"
Monica	 It's okay! It's good! It's good. It's a disease!"
Joey	 No! No! I am not a sex addict!'
Monica	 Yes you are! That's the only way to explain all this stuff!"
Joey	 No it isn't! No, it's not. Because you can also explain it with the truth!"
Rachel	 Well, what is the truth?'
Ross	 Yeah, what's going on?"
Phoebe	 What's going on?"
Joey	 (thinking) I slept with Monica.'
Chandler	 Well let's\xc2\x85.let's see what everybody thinks of that?"
Monica	 Oh no!'
Ross	 You slept with my sister?'
Joey	 Uh yes, but it was, we just did it once uh, in London.'
Ross	 This is not good for my rage. (Takes another pill.)'
Rachel	 Monica, is this true?'
Joey	 Of course it's true! How else would you explain all the weird stuff that's\nbeen going on?"
Monica	 Yes it's true."
Rachel	 Okay, but if it only happened that one time, how come we found your\nunderwear in our apartment the other day?'
Joey	 Ahh\xc2\x97oy! That was the underwear I was wearing that night in London.\nRight Monica?'
Monica	 I guess I wanted to keep it (Pause) as a souvenir. '
Ross	 My God Monica!!'
Chandler	 Are you sure Joe? Are you sure you're not just a sex addict?"
Joey	 No! If anyone's a sex addict here, it's Monica! Yeah. Yeah. She has been\ntrying to get me back in the sack ever since London!"
Phoebe	 So that's why she gave you a naked picture of herself."
Joey	 That makes sense!'
Rachel	 And the video camera?'
Joey	 Uhh, Monica?'
Monica	 I guess I set up the video camera to try and entice Joey.'
Joey	 But sadly I could not be enticed.'
Ross	 Unbelievable! I mean you really kept Joey's underwear?! Why? Why would you\ndo that?!"
Monica	 I'm Monica. I'm disgusting. I stalk guys and keep their underpants."
Joey	 Well, I think we've all learned something about who's disgusting and who's\nnot. Eh? All right, now, I'm going to get back to my bucket. I'm only eating the skin, so\nthe chicken's up for grabs. (Offers it to everyone.)"

Phoebe	 I really thought you making a good point. I mean y'know, until you got\ncut off."
A Female Student	 Yeah, what's up with that girl Monica?"
Phoebe	 I don't know! I didn't come with her!"
Monica	 (entering, happily) All right everybody! Everybody guess what? I just\nconvinced Paul to give us a test next week!'
All	 A test?!!'
Monica	 Come on! Tests make us all better learners! Oh yeah! (Running out) We\nshould have essay questions!!'
