Rachel	 Phoebe?'
Phoebe	 Yeah?'
Rachel	 Look at that guy by the window, wow!'
Phoebe	 He\xc2\x92s awfully short and I think he\xc2\x92s talking to himself. And to\r\r\nbe completely honest, he\xc2\x92s not that good in bed.'
Rachel	 Oh, what is wrong with me lately? I mean it\xc2\x92s like every guy I\r\r\nsee\xc2\x97I mean look here. (Points behind them) Look at that guy for example, I mean\r\r\nnormally that\xc2\x92s not someone I would-would be attracted to, but right now, with the\r\r\nway I\xc2\x92m feeling, all I want to do is rip off his sweatpants and fanny pack.'
Phoebe	 Wait a second! This is about the fourth month of your pregnancy, right?'
Rachel	 Yeah.'
Phoebe	 This is completely normal, around the fourth month your hormones start\r\r\ngoing crazy.'
Rachel	 Really?! So this has happened to you?'
Phoebe	 Oh absolutely yeah! Oh and keep in mind, now, I was carrying triplets so\r\r\nin, y\xc2\x92know, medical terms I was-I was thrice as randy.'
Rachel	 Wow! This explains so much! Last weekend, I went from store to store\r\r\nsitting on Santa\xc2\x92s lap.'
Phoebe	 Yeah. Yeah, I remember trying to steal a cardboard cutout of Evander\r\r\nHolyfield from a Foot Locker.'
Rachel	 Ah.'
Phoebe	 Yeah.'
Rachel	 Well, y\xc2\x92know what? I go see my doctor tomorrow, I\xc2\x92ll ask her\r\r\nabout this. Maybe she can give me a pill or something.'
Phoebe	 Yeah. Yeah, that\xc2\x92s what you need a good\xc2\x85pill.'

Mona	 Hey! (To Joey) Hey!'
Ross	 Hi!'
Mona	 Hi! Look! I got our pictures developed from Rockefeller Center.'
Ross	 Oh great! Hey-hey Joey, do you want to check out pictures of me and Mona\r\r\nice skating?'
Joey	 Oh uh, ordinarily I would love too, but I am just swamped right now.\r\r\n(Brushes something off of his shirt and looks around, but doesn\xc2\x92t move from his\r\r\nchair.)'
Ross	 Hey where-where are the pictures that creepy pretzel vendor took of us\r\r\ntogether?'
Mona	 Oh yeah, probably at the end. (Flips to the end.) Oh my God! He only took\r\r\npictures of my breasts!'
Joey	 I\xc2\x92m missin\xc2\x92 picture time?! (Jumps over to look, Ross glares at\r\r\nhim and he retreats.)'
Phoebe	 (sitting down next to Ross) Y\xc2\x92know she has a face Ross!'
Mona	 Okay. Okay, here\xc2\x92s a good one of us.'
Ross	 Wow! That is a good one! Wow, it looks like a, like a holiday card\r\r\ny\xc2\x92know, with the tree in the middle and the skaters and the snow.'
Mona	 Y\xc2\x92know, every year I say I\xc2\x92m gonna send out holiday cards and I\r\r\nnever do it. Do you wanna, do you wanna send this one out together?'
Ross	 (pause) Together? Like-like to people?'
Mona	 Yeah, y\xc2\x92know. Happy holidays from Mona and Ross. It\xc2\x92ll be cute,\r\r\nokay?'
Ross	 Okay. (Not happy about it.)'
Mona	 Oh, I gotta get to work. So call me later?'
Ross	 Uh sure, sure.'
Mona	 Bye guys.'
Phoebe	 Bye.'
Joey	 (To Ross) Congratulations! You just got married!'
Ross	 I know. Can you believe that?'
Phoebe	 Wait, I\xc2\x92m-I\xc2\x92m sorry. What\xc2\x92s the big deal about a holiday\r\r\ncard?'
Ross	 Married couples send out cards, families send out cards, people who have\r\r\nbeen dating for a couple of months do not send out cards! What-what is she crazy?!'
Joey	 Hey-hey-hey, hey that\xc2\x92s your wife you\xc2\x92re talking about!'
Doug	 Bing! Ho! And the Bing-ette!'
Chandler	 Honey, you remember my boss Doug right?'
Monica	 Yes, hi.'
Doug	 Hi. So good news, the divorce is final. I signed the papers this A.M.'
Chandler	 I didn\xc2\x92t know you and Carol were getting divorced, I\xc2\x92m\r\r\nsorry.'
Doug	 Sorry? Finally chewed my leg out of that bear trap. Hey, congratulations\r\r\nto you guys though!'
Monica	 No leg-chewing for us sir.'
Doug	 Oh well, give it time. So the divorce, the marriage, we\xc2\x92ve got a lot\r\r\nto celebrate. How about we all go out to dinner tomorrow night?'
Monica	 I can\xc2\x92t think of anything we\xc2\x92re doing. (Quietly) Why\r\r\ncan\xc2\x92t I think of anything we\xc2\x92re doing?'
Doug	 Tomorrow night it is then, I should be out of court by six. They keep\r\r\nthrowing these sexual harassment cases at me and I keep knocking them out of the park!'
Monica	 Okay, I\xc2\x92ll see you tomorrow! (Doug exits.) Just so you know,\r\r\nwe\xc2\x92re not seeing him tomorrow. (Chandler wonders why.) I-I cannot spend another\r\r\nevening with that man. Do you remember how he behaved at our wedding?'
Chandler	 No.'
Monica	 That\xc2\x92s because he wasn\xc2\x92t invited because of the way he behaved\r\r\nat our engagement party.'
Chandler	 Oh yeah. Boy, urine cuts right through an ice sculpture\r\r\ndoesn\xc2\x92t it?'
Mona	 Hi!'
Ross	 Hey!'
Mona	 Hey, I went by the photo shop, take a look, here is a mockup of our card.\r\r\nWhat do you think?'
Ross	 Huh. Wow, this is great.'
Mona	 Now, do you think it should say, "Love Ross and Mona?"'
Ross	 Well, we-we haven\xc2\x92t said that to each other yet, but I guess its okay\r\r\nto say it to other people.'
Mona	 How many did you want? I\xc2\x92m getting a hundred.'
Ross	 A hundred?! Well, I-I guess I\xc2\x92ll take a\xc2\x97Mona, uh\xc2\x85I-I\xc2\x92m\r\r\nnot sure about the whole uh, card thing.'
Mona	 Really? Why not?'
Ross	 Sending out a holiday card, together, I mean I just don\xc2\x92t know if\r\r\nwe\xc2\x92re really quite there yet.'
Mona	 Oh y\xc2\x92know, I didn\xc2\x92t think of it that way. You\xc2\x92re right.\r\r\nYou\xc2\x92re right. So, can I ask you a question? '
Ross	 Yeah.'
Mona	 Where are we?'
Ross	 Huh.'
Mona	 Y\xc2\x92know, like where are we? Where is this relationship going?'
Ross	 Hmm\xc2\x85'
Mona	 I mean I love spending time with you, y\xc2\x92know I just\xc2\x97I hope\r\r\nwe\xc2\x92re moving forward. I mean, we should probably talk about that. Don\xc2\x92t you\r\r\nthink?'
Ross	 Let\xc2\x92s do the card!'
Mona	 What?'
Ross	 The card! I think we\xc2\x92re there!'
Mona	 Okay. I\xc2\x97But I think we should still have this conversation.'
Ross	 Really?! I mean, even with the card?'
Nurse	 Hi!'
Rachel	 Hi!'
Nurse	 Just so you know, Dr. Long can\xc2\x92t be here today, she was called to\r\r\nthe hospital, so Dr. Schiff will be seeing you.'
Rachel	 Oh, okay. Hey, can I ask you a question? Was it me, or-or was the guy\r\r\nwho took my blood sample really cute? Y\xc2\x92know who I\xc2\x92m talking about, bald\r\r\nhaircut, hairy fingers\xc2\x85 (Stops when she realizes it was her.)'
Dr. Schiff	 (entering) Hi Rachel? I\xc2\x92m Dr. Schiff. (By the way, he\xc2\x92s an\r\r\nattractive man.)'
Rachel	 Yes, you are.'
Dr. Schiff	 So, how\xc2\x92s it going?'
Rachel	 Oh, really, really good. But enough about me, come on! Where-where are\r\r\nyou from? What do you do?'
Dr. Schiff	 I\xc2\x92m a doctor.'
Rachel	 Right! Right! I-I actually meant in your spare time, do you cook? Do you\r\r\nski? Or do you just hang out with your wife or girlfriend?'
Dr. Schiff	 Uh, I don\xc2\x92t have a wife or girlfriend, but I do like to ski.'
Rachel	 Oh, I love to ski! How amazing is this?!'
Dr. Schiff	 So, are you experiencing any discomfort?'
Rachel	 No. I\xc2\x92m very comfortable.'
Dr. Schiff	 Any painful gas?'
Rachel	 No! Shoot, Dr. Schiff what kind of question is that?!'
Dr. Schiff	 Okay then, would you like to lie down on the table?'
Rachel	 Well would you like me to lie down on the table?'
Dr. Schiff	 I\xc2\x92m sorry, is there something going on here?'
Rachel	 Do you feel it too?'
Rachel	 Hi.'
Phoebe	 Oh hey! So, how did your doctor\xc2\x92s appointment go?'
Rachel	 Well, let\xc2\x92s see. Uh, they gave me cute doctor today and in the\r\r\nmiddle of the exam I put my pinky in his chin dimple.'
Phoebe	 Oh my God.'
Monica	 Why did you do that?'
Phoebe	 Okay, remember that little problem I was having during my\r\r\nfourth month of\r\r\npregnancy?'
Monica	 Oh yeah, the Evander Holyfield phase. Oh man you were so hard up you\r\r\npractically came on to me.'
Phoebe	 You wish.'
Monica	 Hey, I could\xc2\x92ve had you if I wanted you.'
Phoebe	 Oh yeah? Come and get it.'
Rachel	 Okay, even this is turning me on!'
Ross	 (entering) Hey!'
Rachel	 Oh hey! Hey Ross! Hey how\xc2\x92s it, how\xc2\x92s it going with you and\r\r\nMona? Are you guys still together?'
Ross	 Oh yeah, yeah we\xc2\x92re moving forward. You\xc2\x92ll be getting our card!'
Monica	 You and Mona are doing a holiday card together?'
Ross	 Yeah, we\xc2\x92re not just doing a card! Y\xc2\x92know, she-she also wants to\r\r\nhave the conversation about where the relationship is going.'
Phoebe	 Ugh! Women!'
Ross	 I know! I know! Why do you guys need to have this conversation?! Huh? I\r\r\nmean no self-respecting man would ask a woman, "So, where is this going?"'
Rachel	 Uh Ross? You asked me that.'
Ross	 Hey! You were a closed book! Okay? I\xc2\x92m not a mind reader! Besides, I\r\r\nhate those conversations. I\xc2\x92m horrible at them. Really! Maybe-maybe I need kind of a\r\r\ngesture. Y\xc2\x92know, something that says we\xc2\x92re moving forward without having to talk\r\r\nabout it.'
Monica	 Like asking her to move in with you?'
Ross	 Smaller than that.'
Monica	 Making her a mixed tape?'
Ross	 Uh, bigger than that.'
Phoebe	 Give her a key to your apartment.'
Ross	 Whoa-hello! We were closer with the mixed tape.'
Monica	 All right. Have you said, "I love you?" You could say, I love\r\r\nyou.'
Ross	 Yeah I-I don\xc2\x92t-I don\xc2\x92t think I\xc2\x92m quite there yet, but I\r\r\ncould say I looove spending time with you.'
Phoebe	 No, we hate that.'
Monica	 That is a slap in the face.'
Ross	 Forget it. I-I\xc2\x97Y\xc2\x92know what? I\xc2\x92ll just have the\r\r\nconversation. I\xc2\x92ll just say I like things the way they are, and hope for the best.\r\r\nWhat do you think Rach?'
Rachel	 I think, if it was a little colder in here I could see your nipples\r\r\nthrough that sweater.'
Doug	 Bing! We\xc2\x92re all set for tonight, 8 o\xc2\x92clock.'
Chandler	 Oh uh, as it turns out, we can\xc2\x92t do it. Monica has to work.'
Doug	 Oh, my ex-wife didn\xc2\x92t work, unless you call turning into her mother\r\r\nwork. Fine. Tomorrow night then.'
Chandler	 Oh uh well tomorrow\xc2\x92s no good for her either.'
Doug	 Oh? Why not?'
Chandler	 It\xc2\x92s the semi-finals\xc2\x85of her\xc2\x85botchy ball tournament.'
Doug	 What\xc2\x92s going on Bing? Does uh, your wife have a problem with me or\r\r\nsomething?'
Chandler	 Well now-now you\xc2\x92re just talking crazy.'
Doug	 So why can\xc2\x92t the three of us go out together?'
Chandler	 Because uh\xc2\x85we-we\xc2\x85we split up. Monica and I split up. Hold\r\r\nme.'
Doug	 Good God Bing I\xc2\x85well I can\xc2\x92t say I\xc2\x92m altogether surprised,\r\r\nI saw the way she looked at you, and there was no love there. And the way she looked at\r\r\nme, pure lust.'
Chandler	 Y\xc2\x92know what would really help me through this tough time is\r\r\nchoking something. Can I choke ya?'
Doug	 Bing my boy, we\xc2\x92re gonna get you over this. Now here\xc2\x92s the plan,\r\r\ngrab your coat, we\xc2\x92re going to a strip club.'
Chandler	 Oh no-no-no, Monica would freak. (Doug looks at him.) But to hell with\r\r\nthat bitch.'
Ross	 Here we go. Mona umm, I think it\xc2\x92s time we-we had a conversation\r\r\nabout-about where things are with us.'
Mona	 Yeah, I-I think I suggested that.'
Ross	 Aw, we-we are so\xc2\x85(Motions that they\xc2\x92re connected.) So umm, well\r\r\nI-I-I like you and I-I love umm, y\xc2\x92know hanging out with you. And I mean-I\xc2\x92m\r\r\nhaving a lot of fun. (He pauses and thinks there might be more, but decides there\r\r\nisn\xc2\x92t.)'
Mona	 Okay.'
Ross	 I mean, there\xc2\x92s no point in spending time with someone if-if\r\r\nit\xc2\x92s just fun. It\xc2\x92s gotta be, it\xc2\x92s gotta be going somewhere right? So\r\r\nwhere-where is it going? (Pause) Ah! That\xc2\x92s-that\xc2\x92s the real question. And-and\r\r\nthe answer is\xc2\x85is it\xc2\x92s going somewhere\xc2\x85fun. Now I-I know what you\xc2\x92re\r\r\nthinking, fun was fine for you like ten years ago y\xc2\x92know, but you\xc2\x92re-you\xc2\x92re\r\r\nnot getting any younger. No I mean\xc2\x97No not you, not you, you\xc2\x97you are\r\r\ngetting younger. I mean\xc2\x97you-you look like you\xc2\x92re getting younger by the\r\r\nsecond\xc2\x97What\xc2\x92s your secret?'
Mona	 I\xc2\x92m sorry, so umm, so where are we?'
Ross	 Well, well to sum up, we\xc2\x92re having fun, you look young.'
Mona	 Okay\xc2\x85'
Ross	 But that\xc2\x92s not enough. So\xc2\x85 So\xc2\x85here\xc2\x92s a key to my\r\r\napartment. (Hands her his key.)'
Mona	 Really?!'
Ross	 Really.'
Mona	 You don\xc2\x92t think this is too fast. '

Rachel	 You gave her a key to your apartment?!'
Ross	 Not just a key, I gave her the only key! I am now a homeless person in a\r\r\nvery serious relationship.'
Phoebe	 (entering with some guy) Hey. Ooh Ross! How\xc2\x92d the conversation go?'
Ross	 Oh great, I live on the street.'
Phoebe	 Where?! (Ross exits.)'
Rachel	 Hey!'
Phoebe	 Hi! Okay, Monica, Rachel, this is my friend Roger.'
Roger	 Hey everybody.'
Monica	 Hi Roger.'
Phoebe	 So umm, I\xc2\x92m gonna get us some drinks. (To Rachel) Would you help me\r\r\nout?'
Rachel	 Yeah. (They go into the kitchen.)'
Phoebe	 Umm, he\xc2\x92s here to have sex with you.'
Rachel	 What?'
Phoebe	 You\xc2\x92re welcome.'
Rachel	 Phoebe no!'
Phoebe	 It\xc2\x92s okay, he\xc2\x92s a virgin.'
Monica	 Rachel umm, I was just talking to this guy and I think he\xc2\x92ll have\r\r\nsex with you.'
Phoebe	 Yeah, okay let\xc2\x92s leave these two alone.'
Rachel	 No! I do not care what my hormones are doing, I am not going to just do\r\r\nit with some random guy!'
Phoebe	 Fine! Then you tell Roger because he was really looking forward to this!\r\r\n(Phoebe exits.)'
Doug	 Oh Bing, look at those twin sisters dancing together. Let me buy you a lap\r\r\ndance with those girls. Huh?'
Chandler	 Oh that\xc2\x92s all right sir, and that\xc2\x92s just one girl.'
Doug	 Bing\xc2\x97What\xc2\x92s this?! (Grabs his hand.)'
Chandler	 It\xc2\x92s a hand. It\xc2\x92s a thing you use as a Jack and Coke\r\r\nholder.'
Doug	 No, it\xc2\x92s a wedding ring. You gotta get rid of it. We\xc2\x92re gonna go\r\r\nto the East River right now and throw it in there!'
Chandler	 Oh no-no-no!'
Doug	 Oh yeah-yeah-yeah, y\xc2\x92know I did it and I felt a hell of a lot better\r\r\nand if you whip it just right you might hit a seagull in the head.'
Ross	 Okay, and oh I\xc2\x92m gonna need a bunch of extra keys. Apparently I give\r\r\nthem away for no reason at all.'
Mona	 (entering) Hey Ross, what\xc2\x92s going on? You changing the lock?'
Ross	 No. That guy is.'
Mona	 I don\xc2\x92t understand. You-you give me a key to your apartment and then\r\r\nyou change the lock.'
Locksmith	 Good luck buddy. (Exits.)'
Mona	 Umm, I-I thought we were moving forward and now you\xc2\x92re-you\xc2\x92re\r\r\nsending me all these mixed signals. What are you trying to tell me?'
Ross	 I\xc2\x92m trying to tell you I made you a mix tape.'
Mona	 What?'
Ross	 I love you!'
Mona	 Ohh! (Hugs him.) And I love spending time with you. (Ross isn\xc2\x92t\r\r\nhappy.)'
Chandler	 Hi honey I\xc2\x92m home.'
Monica	 From the tequila factory?'
Chandler	 It was awful. To get out of going to dinner with Doug I told him that\r\r\nyou and I split up. So then he took me to all these strip clubs and sleazy bars, and then\r\r\nwhen I wouldn\xc2\x92t give him my wedding ring, he threw a soda can at a bird!'
Monica	 Come here. I can breath through my mouth.'
Chandler	 Y\xc2\x92know what the worse part was? I got to see what my life would\r\r\nbe like without you. It was like It\xc2\x92s a Wonderful Life with lap dances. Please\r\r\npromise that you will never leave me, that we will grow old together, and be with each\r\r\nother for the rest of our lives.'
Monica	 I promise. Hey, speaking of together, how about we send out a holiday\r\r\ncard this year?'
Chandler	 Ooh, I don\xc2\x92t know if we\xc2\x92re there yet.'
Rachel	 Yes. Hi, I\xc2\x92d like to order a pizza. Okay, can I ask you a question?\r\r\nIs-is the cute blond guy delivering tonight? Very Ambercrombie & Fitch. (Joey\r\r\nenters.) I\xc2\x92ll call you back.'
Joey	 Who was that?'
Rachel	 It\xc2\x92s just the pizza place.'
Joey	 You hung up on the pizza place? I don\xc2\x92t hang up on your friends.'
Rachel	 I\xc2\x92m sorry honey, I\xc2\x92m just having a, having a rough day.'
Joey	 Oh, what\xc2\x92s wrong?'
Rachel	 Oh you really, you really just don\xc2\x92t want to hear about it.'
Joey	 Then why did I ask?'
Rachel	 Okay, it\xc2\x92s just\xc2\x97and this is really embarrassing\xc2\x97but\r\r\nlately with this whole pregnancy thing I\xc2\x92m just finding myself\xc2\x85how do I put this\r\r\numm, erotically charged.'
Joey	 Is that college talk for horny?'
Rachel	 Yeah. So y\xc2\x92know, I have all of these feelings and I don\xc2\x92t know\r\r\nwhat to do about them, because I can\xc2\x92t date like a normal person, which is fine\r\r\nbecause I don\xc2\x92t need a relationship, I mean all I really want is one great night.\r\r\nJust sex, y\xc2\x92know? No strings attached, no relationship, just with someone that I feel\r\r\ncomfortable with and who knows what he\xc2\x92s doing. For just one great night, I mean is\r\r\nthat really so\xc2\x85hard\xc2\x85to find. (Looks at Joey.) So how was your day?'
Joey	 Good, I uh, I saw a pretty big pigeon.'
Rachel	 Well, I gotta get up early and it\xc2\x92s almost seven o\xc2\x92clock.'
Joey	 Yeah, I gotta, I gotta go to my room too.'
Rachel	 Okay, good night!'
Joey	 Good night. (They both enter their rooms.)'
Joey	 (entering) I can\xc2\x92t do it!'
Rachel	 (entering) I didn\xc2\x92t ask you to do it!'
Joey	 You\xc2\x92re Rachel!'
Rachel	 You\xc2\x92re Joey!'
Joey	 You\xc2\x92re my friend!'
Rachel	 Right back at ya!'
Joey	 But plus, it would be wrong and weird and-and-and bad.'
Rachel	 And so bad. I don\xc2\x92t even know what you\xc2\x92re talking about\r\r\nbecause I didn\xc2\x92t ask you to do anything!'
Joey	 I know!'
Joey	 Do you wanna do it?'
Rachel	 No!'
Joey	 All right, me neither! I was just testing you!'
Rachel	 That\xc2\x92s the end of this conversation!'
Joey	 This conversation never happened!'
Rachel	 Never happened! Good night!'
Joey	 Good night!'
Joey	 Get back in there! (Rachel re-enters her room and closes the door.)'

Phoebe	 Hi. Listen, I\xc2\x92m sorry about that whole thing with Roger. It really\r\r\nwasn\xc2\x92t right, and I, and I want to make it up to you, so umm, I brought you something\r\r\nthat I think you\xc2\x92ll really enjoy. (Goes into the hallway and returns carrying the\r\r\nEvander Holyfield cutout.) Now, this is just a loan. Okay? I\xc2\x92m gonna, I\xc2\x92m gonna\r\r\nwant him back. So\xc2\x85 (Looks at him longingly) I\xc2\x92m gonna go now. (Exits.) (Pause)\r\r\n(Entering) I\xc2\x92m sorry, I thought I could do it and I can\xc2\x92t! (She grabs the cutout\r\r\nand exits for good.)'
