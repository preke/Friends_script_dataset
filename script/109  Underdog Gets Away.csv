Rachel	 Terry, I, I, I know that I haven't worked here very long, but I was\nwondering, do you think it would be possible if I got a $100 advance in my salary?"
Terry	 An advance?'
Rachel	 It's so that I can spend Thanksgiving with my family. See, every year we\ngo skiing in Vail, and normally my father pays for my ticket, but I sort of started the\nwhole independence thing, you know, which is actually why I took this job."
Terry	 Rachel, Rachel, sweetheart. You're a terrible, terrible waitress. Really,\nreally awful."
Rachel	 Ok, I, I hear what you're sayin'. I'm with you. Um, but I, but I'm\ntrying really hard. And I think I'm doing better. I really do. Does anybody need coffee?\n(everyone in the place raises their hand) Oh, look at that."
Rachel	 Excuse me, sir. Hi, you come in here all time. I was just wondering, do\nyou think there's a possibility that you could give me an advance on my tips?"
Guy	 Huh?'
Rachel	 Ok, ok, that's fine. Fine. Hey, I'm sorry about that spill before.\n(picks up the tip he leaves) Only $98.50 to go. "
Monica	 Hey. Ross, did you know Mom and Dad are going to Puerto Rico for\nThanksgiving?'
Ross	 No, they're not."
Monica	 Yes, they are. The Blymens invited them.'
Ross	 You're wrong."
Monica	 I am not wrong.'
Ross	 You're wrong."
Monica	 No, I just talked to them.'
Ross	 (getting up, upset) I'm calling Mom."
Joey	 Hey, hey.'
Chandler	 Hey.'
Phoebe	 Hey.'
Chandler	 And this from the cry-for-help department. Are you wearing makeup?'
Joey	 Yes, I am. As of today, I am officially Joey Tribbiani, actor slash model.'
Chandler	 That's so funny, 'cause I was thinking you look more like Joey\nTribbiani, man slash woman."
Phoebe	 What were you modeling for?'
Joey	 You know those posters for the city free clinic?'
Monica	 Oh, wow, so you\'re gonna be one of those "healthy, healthy, healthy\nguys"?'
Phoebe	 You know, the asthma guy was really cute.'
Chandler	 Do you know which one you're gonna be?"
Joey	 No, but I hear lyme disease is open, so... (crosses fingers) '
Chandler	 Good luck, man. I hope you get it.'
Joey	 Thanks.'
Ross	 (to Monica) Well, you were right. How can they do this to us, huh? It's\nThanksgiving. "
Monica	 Ok, I'll tell you what. How about I cook dinner at my place? I'll make\nit just like Mom's."
Ross	 Will you make the mashed potatoes with the lumps?'
Monica	 You know, they're not actually supposed to have... (Ross looks at her\nsheepishly) I'll work on the lumps. Joey, you're going home, right?"
Joey	 Yeah.'
Monica	 And I assume, Chandler, you are still boycotting all the pilgrim\nholidays.'
Chandler	 Yes, every single one of them.'
Monica	 Phoebe, you're gonna be with your grandma?"
Phoebe	 Yes, and her boyfriend. But we're celebrating Thanksgiving in December\n'cause he is lunar."
Monica	 So you're free Thursday, then."
Phoebe	 Yeah. Oh, can I come?'
Monica	 Yeah. Rach, are you thinking you're gonna make it to Vail?"
Rachel	 Absolutely. Shoop, shoop, shoop. Only a hundred and two dollars to go.'
Chandler	 I thought it was $98.50.'
Rachel	 Yeah, well it was. I, I broke a cup.'
Ross	 Well, I'm off to Carol's."
Phoebe	 Ooh, ooh! Why don't we invite her?"
Ross	 (mimicking) Ooh, ooh. Because she's my ex-wife, and will probably want to\nbring her, ooh, ooh, lesbian life partner."
Ross	 Hi, is uh, is Carol here?'
Susan	 No, she's at a faculty meeting."
Ross	 Oh, I uh, just came by to pick up my skull. Well, not mine, but...Susan
Ross	 Thanks. Yeah, Carol borrowed it for a class, and I have to get it back to\nthe museum.'
Susan	 What's it look like?"
Ross	 Kinda like a big face without skin.'
Susan	 Yes, I'm familiar with the concept. We can just look for it."
Ross	 Ok. (browsing the apartment) Wow, you guys sure have a lot of books about\nbein' a lesbian."
Susan	 Well, you know, you have to take a course. Otherwise, they don't let you\ndo it. "
Ross	 (picking up a book) Hey, hey, Yertle the Turtle. A classic.'
Susan	 Actually, I'm reading it to the baby."
Ross	 The uh, the baby that hasn't been born yet? Wouldn't that mean you're...\ncrazy?"
Susan	 What, you don't think they can hear sounds in there?"
Ross	 You're not serious, I mean, you really... you really talk to it?"
Susan	 Yeah, all the time. I want the baby to know my voice.'
Ross	 Do you uh, do you talk about me?'
Susan	 Yeah, yeah, all the time.'
Ross	 Really?'
Susan	 But um, we just refer to you as Bobo the Sperm Guy.'
Ross	 Look, if she's talking to it, I just think that I should get some belly\ntime too. Not that I believe any of this."
Phoebe	 Oh, I believe it. I think the baby can totally hear everything. I can\nshow you. Look, this will seem a little weird, but you put your head inside this turkey,\nand then we'll all talk, and you'll hear everything we say."
Chandler	 I'd just like to say that I'm totally behind this experiment. In fact,\nI'd very much like to butter your head."
Monica	 Hey, Rach, did you make your money?'
Rachel	 No, not even close. Forget Vail, forget seeing my family, forget shoop,\nshoop, shoop.'
Monica	 Rach, here's your mail."
Rachel	 Thanks, you can just put it on the table.'
Monica	 (insistently) No, here's your mail."
Rachel	 Thanks, you can just put it on the table.'
Monica	 (gives her an envelope) Would you just open it?'
Rachel	 Oh my god, oh, you guys are great.'
Monica	 We all chipped in.'
Joey	 (to Monica) We did?'
Monica	 (to Joey) You owe me 20 bucks.'
Rachel	 Thank you. Thank you so much!'
Monica	 (hands Chandler a bag) Chandler, here you go, got your traditional\nThanksgiving feast, you got your tomato soup, your grilled cheese fixin's, and your family\nsize bag of Funyuns."
Rachel	 Wait, wait, Chandler, this is what you're havin' for Thanksgiving\ndinner? What, what, what is it with you and this holiday?"
Chandler	 All right, I'm nine years old."
Ross	 Oh, I hate this story.'
Chandler	 We just finished this magnificent Thanksgiving dinner. I have--and I\nremember this part vividly--a mouthful of pumpkin pie, and this is the moment my parents\nchoose to tell me they're getting divorced."
Rachel	 Oh my god.'
Chandler	 Yes. It's very difficult to appreciate a Thanksgiving dinner once\nyou've seen it in reverse."
Joey	 Uh, hi. We uh, we used to work together.'
Girl	 We did?'
Joey	 Yeah, at Macy's. You were the Obsession girl, right? I was the Aramis guy.\n(pretends to spray cologne) Aramis? Aramis? "
Girl	 Yeah, right.'
Joey	 I gotta tell you. You're the best in the business."
Girl	 Get out.'
Joey	 I'm serious. You're amazing. You know when to spritz, when to lay back."
Girl	 Really? You don't know what that means to me."
Joey	 Ooh, you smell great tonight. What're you wearing?"
Girl	 (provocatively) Nothing.'
Joey	 Listen, uh, you wanna go get a drink or something?'
Girl	 Yeah. (she gets up, notices something behind Joey) Oh.'
Joey	 What's wrong?"
Girl	 I just remembered, I have to do something.'
Joey	 Oh. What?'
Girl	 Um, leave.'
Joey	 Wait, wait, wait!'
Joey	 So I guess you all saw it.'
Rachel	 Saw what?'
Phoebe	 No, we were just laughing. You know, how laughter can be infectious.'
Joey	 Set another place for Thanksgiving. My entire family thinks I have VD.'
Chandler	 Tonight, on a very special Blossom.'
Monica	 Mmm, looking good. Ok, cider's mulling, turkey's turking, yams are\nyamming. (notices Ross is depressed) What?"
Ross	 I don't know. It's just not the same without Mom in the kitchen."
Monica	 All right, that's it. You know what? Just get out of my way and stop\nmoping."
Ross	 That's closer."
Rachel	 I got the tickets! I got the tickets! Five hours from now, shoop, shoop,\nshoop.'
Chandler	 Oh, you must stop shooping.'
Rachel	 Ok, I'm gonna get my stuff."
Joey	 Chandler, will you just come in already?'
Chandler	 No, I prefer to keep a safe distance from all this merriment.'
Phoebe	 Look out, incoming pumpkin pie!'
Chandler	 Ok, we all laughed when you did it with the stuffing, but that's not\nfunny anymore."
Joey	 Hey, Monica, I got a question. I don't see any tater tots."
Monica	 That's not a question."
Joey	 But my mom always makes them. It's like a tradition. You get a little\npiece of turkey on your fork, a little cranberry sauce, and a tot! It's bad enough I can't\nbe with my family because of my disease."
Monica	 All right, fine. Tonight's potatoes will be both mashed with lumps, and\nin the form of tots."
Ross	 Ok, I'm off to talk to my unborn child. "
Monica	 Ah!'
Ross	 Ok, Mom never hit.'
Phoebe	 (stirring pot) Ok, all done.'
Monica	 What, Phoebe, did you whip the potatoes? Ross needs lumps!'
Phoebe	 Oh, I'm sorry, oh, I just, I thought we could have them whipped and then\nadd some peas and onions."
Monica	 Why would we do that?'
Phoebe	 Well, 'cause then they'd be like my mom used to make them, you know,\nbefore she died."
Monica	 Ok, three kinds of potatoes coming up.'
Rachel	 Ok, good-bye you guys. Thanks for everything. (she starts to leave, and\nhits everyone with her skis) Oh, sorry! Oh, sorry!'
Chandler	 The most unbelievable thing has happened. Underdog has just gotten\naway.'
Joey	 The balloon?'
Chandler	 No, no, the actual cartoon character. Of course the balloon. It's all\nover the news. Right before he reached Macy's, he broke free and was spotted\nflying over Washington Square Park. I'm goin' to the roof, who's with me?"
Rachel	 I can't, I gotta go."
Chandler	 Come on. An 80-foot inflatable dog let loose over the city. How often\ndoes that happen?'
Phoebe	 Almost never.'
Monica	 Got the keys? or Got the keys!'
Rachel	 Ok.'
Carol	 Anytime you're ready."
Ross	 Ok, ok, here we go. (he crouches down near her stomach) Ok, where am I\ntalking to, here? I mean, uh, well, there is one way that seems to offer a certain\nacoustical advantage, but...'
Carol	 Just aim for the bump.'
Ross	 Ok, ok, ok, ok, here goes. You know, I, you know, can't do this. Uh, this\nis too weird. I feel stupid."
Carol	 So don't do it, it's fine. You don't have to do it just because Susan\ndoes it."
Ross	 (quickly talking) Hello, baby. Hello, hello.'
Rachel	 I loved the moment when you first saw the giant dog shadow all over the\npark.'
Phoebe	 Yeah, but did they have to shoot him down? I mean, that was just mean.'
Monica	 Ok, right about now the turkey should be crispy on the outside, juicy on\nthe inside. Why are we standing here?'
Rachel	 We're waiting for you to open the door. You got the keys."
Monica	 No I don't."
Rachel	 Yes, you do. When we left, you said, "got the keys."'
Monica	 No I didn\'t. I asked, "got the ke-eys?"'
Rachel	 No, no, no, you said, "got the keys".'
Chandler	 Do either of you have the keys?'
Monica	 (panicked) The oven is on.'
Rachel	 Oh, I gotta get my ticket!'
Joey	 Wait, wait, we have a copy of your key.'
Monica	 Well then get it, get it!'
Joey	 That tone will not make me go any faster.'
Monica	 (angry) Joey!'
Joey	 That one will. '
Ross	 And everyone's telling me, you gotta pick a major, you gotta pick a major.\nSo, on a dare, I picked paleontology. And you have no idea what I'm saying, because, let's\nface it, you're a fetus. You're just happy you don't have gills anymore."
Carol	 Look, you don't have to talk to it. You can sing to it if you want."
Ross	 Oh, please. I am not singing to your stomach, ok?'
Susan	 Hi, how's it goin?"
Ross	 Shh! (singing) Here we come, walkin' down the street, get the funniest\nlooks from, everyone we meet. Hey, hey! (to Carol) Hey, uh, did you just feel that?"
Carol	 I did.'
Ross	 Does it always, uh--?'
Carol	 No, no that was the first.'
Susan	 Keep singing! Keep singing!'
Ross	 (singing) Hey, hey, you're my baby, and I can't wait to meet you. When\nyou come out I'll buy you a bagel, and then we'll go to the zoo."
Susan	 I felt it!'
Ross	 (singin) Hey, hey, I'm your daddy. I'm the one without any breasts."
Joey	 Nope, not that one.'
Monica	 Can you go any faster with that?'
Joey	 Hey, I got one keyhole and about a zillion keys. You do the math.'
Monica	 Why do you guys have so many keys in there anyway?'
Chandler	 (sarcastic) For an emergency just like this.'
Rachel	 (grabs Chandler by the shirt) All right, listen, smirky. If it wasn't\nfor you and your stupid balloon, I would be on a plane watching a woman do this (makes a\ngesture like a stewardess pointing out exits) right now. But I'm not."
Monica	 I swear you said you had the keys.'
Rachel	 No, I didn't. I wouldn't say I had the keys unless I had the keys, and I\nobviously didn't have the keys."
Phoebe	 Ooh, ok, that's it. Enough with the keys. No one say keys."
Monica	 Why would I have the keys?'
Rachel	 Aside from the fact that you said you had them?'
Monica	 But I didn't."
Rachel	 Well, you should have.'
Monica	 Why?'
Rachel	 Because!'
Monica	 Why?'
Rachel	 Because!'
Monica	 Why? Because everything is my responsibility? Isn't it enough that I'm\nmaking Thanksgiving dinner for everyone? You know, everyone wants a different kind of\npotatoes, so I'm making different kinds of potatoes. Does anybody care what kind of\npotatoes I want? Nooooo, no, no! (starting to cry) Just as long as Phoebe gets her peas\nand onions, and Mario gets his tots, and it's my first Thanksgiving, and it's all burned,\nand, and I... I..."
Chandler	 Ok, Monica, only dogs can hear you now, so, look, the door's open.\nHere we go."
Monica	 Well, the turkey's burnt. (checking pots) Potatoes are ruined, potatoes\nare ruined, potatoes are ruined."
Ross	 Here we come, walkin' down the\xc2\x97this doesn't smell like Mom's."
Monica	 No, it doesn't, does it? But you wanted lumps, Ross? (picks up the pan\nof badly burnt potatoes) Well, here you go, buddy, ya got one."
Rachel	 Oh, god, this is great! The plane is gone, so it looks like I'm stuck\nhere with you guys."
Joey	 Hey, we all had better plans. This was nobody's first choice."
Monica	 Oh, really? So why was I busting my ass to make this delicious\nThanksgiving dinner?'
Joey	 You call that delicious? '
Monica	 Stop it, stop it, stop it!'
Chandler	 Now this feels like Thanksgiving.'
Phoebe	 Ooh. '
Rachel	 What?'
Phoebe	 Ugly Naked Guy's taking his turkey out of the oven. Oh my god. He's not\nalone. Ugly Naked Guy's having Thanksgiving dinner with Ugly Naked Gal."
Joey	 I've gotta see this. All right Ugly Naked Guy!"
Monica	 Ooh, Ugly Naked Dancing!'
Phoebe	 It's nice that he has someone."
Chandler	 Shall I carve?'
Rachel	 By all means.'
Chandler	 Ok, who wants light cheese, and who wants dark cheese?'
Ross	 I don't even wanna know about the dark cheese."
Monica	 (holding sandwich) Does anybody wanna split this with me?'
Joey	 Oh, I will.'
Phoebe	 Ooh, you guys have to make a wish.'
Monica	 Make a wish?'
Phoebe	 Come on, you know, Thanksgiving. Ooh, you got the bigger half. What'd\nyou wish for?"
Joey	 The bigger half.'
Chandler	 I'd like to propose a toast. Little toast here, ding ding. I know this\nisn't the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been\nreally great, you know, I think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting.\nAnyway, I was just thinking, I mean, if you'd gone to Vail, and if you guys'd been with\nyour family, if you didn't have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn't be all together, you know?\nSo I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings\nsucked."
All	 That's so sweet."
Ross	 And hey, here's to a lousy Christmas."
Rachel	 And a crappy New Year.'
Chandler	 Here, here!'
