Ross	 All right! (Checking his watch) Yes!! From home to the hospital in under\nseven minutes! We did it!!'
Rachel	 (deadpan) Yes, the hard part is truly over.'
Ross	 No, but come on, we\xc2\x92re off to a great start aren\xc2\x92t we? I knew\nI\xc2\x92d get you here fast, but this has got to be some kind of a record!'
Phoebe	 Oh you made it!'
Rachel	 Hi! (Ross is stunned.)'
Monica	 How are you doing?'
Ross	 Wait a minute! How-how the hell did you beat us here?'
Monica	 We took a cab. Did you guys walk?'
Ross	 N\xc2\x85 No! We took a cab too, but I did test runs!'
Chandler	 Hi!'
Joey	 Hey! You made it!'
Ross	 Okay is there\xc2\x85some kind of magic tunnel to this hospital?!'
Rachel	 Ross, you stay here and talk, I\xc2\x92m gonna go have a baby.'
Ross	 Okay. Okay. (To the nurse behind the desk.) Umm hi, this is Rachel Green.\nI\xc2\x92m Ross Geller. We-we called from the car.'
Nurse	 Right! We have a semi-private labor room waiting for you. So in just a\nminute\xc2\x85'
Rachel	 (interrupting her) Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! I\xc2\x92m sorry, semi-private? We\n(Laughs), we asked for a private room.'
Nurse	 Yes, I see that here. Unfortunately we can\xc2\x92t guarantee a private\nroom and currently they\xc2\x92re all unavailable.'
Chandler	 Man, if only you\xc2\x92d gotten here sooner. (Ross turns and glares at\nhim.)'
Nurse	 I\xc2\x92m sorry. Semi-private rooms are all we have.'
Rachel	 Okay. Just give us a second. Ross! (They walk away from the desk.)'
Ross	 Yeah?'
Rachel	 Give her some money.'
Ross	 I really think they\xc2\x92re out of rooms.'
Rachel	 They\xc2\x92re not!! Ross, they\xc2\x92re just saving them for the important\npeople!! Okay?! What-what if I was the president?!'
Ross	 Well then we\xc2\x92d be in a lot of trouble, you don\xc2\x92t know where any\ncountries are. (Rachel glares at him.) Okay. (He goes over to the desk followed by\nRachel.) Uh, say would you umm\xc2\x85 Would you mind checking again to see if any umm,\nprivate rooms may have (Handing her some money) opened up?'
Nurse	 This is a hospital.'
Rachel	 (standing up) Okay. Y\xc2\x92know what? I\xc2\x92d have to say I really\ndon\xc2\x92t care for your tone. And this is not the only hospital in this city and we have\nno problem to\xc2\x97Whoa! (She starts a contraction) Oh gosh! Whoa!'
Ross	 What-what?'
Rachel	 Ow! Ow! Contraction. (Sits back down.) Ow-ow! Ow-ow! (Starts breathing\nheavily.)'
Nurse	 Would you like to see a semi-private room?'
Rachel	 Yeah, it couldn\xc2\x92t hurt to look.'

Dr. Long	 Well you\xc2\x92re only two centimeters dilated and we need to get to\nten. It\xc2\x92ll be a while.'
Rachel	 Oh, okay.'
Dr. Long	 I\xc2\x92ll be back in an hour to check you again.'
Ross	 Thank you.'
Rachel	 Thank you. (Dr. Long exits.) Well, I guess we have some time to kill.'
Ross	 Yeah, guess so. Whew! Check these out! (He\xc2\x92s looking at the stirrups\non the other bed in the room and Rachel groans. Ross then hops into the bed and puts his\nlegs into the stirrups.) Never done this before.'
Rachel	 Yeah well it looks great!'
Man	 Thank you very much.'
Woman	 Thanks.'
Ross	 Hi! Hi, I\xc2\x92m uh Ross. I\xc2\x92m here to ruin this magical day for you.'
Man	 Oh no-no, not at all.'
Woman	 Don\xc2\x92t worry about it.'
Man	 Marc Coreger, this is my wife Julie.'
Ross	 Hi Julie.'
Julie	 Hi.'
Ross	 This is Rachel. (Points at her.)'
Rachel	 Hi! '
Marc	 Oh hi Rachel.'
Rachel	 How are you?'
Julie	 Hi. Is this your first?'
Rachel	 Yeah it is.'
Julie	 Well, little Jamie here is our third. So, if you have questions or you\nneed anything at all, just holler.'
Rachel	 That\xc2\x92s so sweet.'
Ross	 Yeah.'
Rachel	 Oh.'
Ross	 Umm say, I-I opened this earlier (The privacy screen) but let me give you\nguys some privacy.'
Marc	 No nonsense! We\xc2\x92re all in this together.'
Julie	 Yeah, we are going to share every moment of this with you. And I think\nwe\xc2\x92re gonna have some fun.'
Marc	 Yeah.'
Ross	 Oh, okay.'
Marc	 Hey! Smile! (Points his camera at Ross and Rachel.)'
Rachel	 Oh no, I really don\xc2\x92t want any\xc2\x97(He takes the picture)\xc2\x97Oh!\nThank you. Oh. Oh Ross\xc2\x85'
Ross	 What?'
Rachel	 Here comes another contraction.'
Ross	 Oh. Okay, just breathe.'
Julie	 Oh honey, I think I\xc2\x92m having one too!'
Marc	 Look at this! (Takes another picture) There we go!'
Phoebe	 (looking at the clock) Oh wow, three hours and still no baby. Ugh, the\nmiracle of birth sure is a snooze fest.'
Monica	 Hey, you wanna see something?'
Phoebe	 Sure! What?'
Monica	 Umm, this is going to be fun. Watch me freak out Chandler. Honey?'
Chandler	 Yeah?'
Monica	 Listen uh, I-I\xc2\x92ve been doing some thinking, and I don\xc2\x92t know\nwhether it\xc2\x92s because we\xc2\x92re here or Rachel\xc2\x92s giving birth but umm, I think\nwe should try to have a baby.'
Chandler	 Okay.'
Monica	 (freaking out) What-what-what\xc2\x92s that now?!'
Chandler	 Okay. I\xc2\x92ve been thinking about it too, and I, I think we\xc2\x92re\nready.'
Monica	 What?! Are you kidding me?! You-you-you think we\xc2\x92re ready to have a\nbaby now?!'
Phoebe	 Oh, this is fun.'
Joey	 You\xc2\x92re ready to have a baby? My boy\xc2\x92s all grown up!'
Chandler	 But you said you were ready too.'
Monica	 Yeah but I was just screwing with you to try to get your voice all high\nand weird like mine is now!'
Chandler	 Yes, but haven\xc2\x92t you wanted a kid like forever?'
Monica	 Okay, just back off mister! Whoa. (Pause) \xc2\x91Cause I am ready\nto have a baby. I just want Joey to be the father.'
Joey	 (voice all high and weird) What?! Are you crazy?!'
Monica	 That\xc2\x92s it! Right there! Is all I wanted!'
Marc	 I am so sorry. The doctor insisted on closing the curtain for the exam.'
Rachel	 Oh, that\xc2\x92s very\xc2\x97Really very-very okay.'
Marc	 Julie\xc2\x92s cervix is dilated a seven centimeters, that\xc2\x92s about four\nfingers. The doctor let me feel it myself.'
Julie	 Have you felt Rachel\xc2\x92s cervix Ross?'
Rachel	 (simultaneously as Ross) No, I don\xc2\x92t think we\xc2\x92ll be doing\nthat.'
Ross	 (simultaneously as Rachel) We\xc2\x92re not gonna do that.'
Julie	 Well, if you like you can feel Rachel\xc2\x92s and then feel mine to\ncompare. '
Mrs. Geller	 (entering) Am I interrupting?'
Ross	 Uh yes! Thank you.'
Rachel	 Oh. Oh wait no.'
Ross	 Later.'
Rachel	 No-no-don\xc2\x92t! Don\xc2\x92t leave me here with these people.'
Ross	 Oh uh, I\xc2\x92m sorry. (Runs out.)'
Rachel	 No Ross! Ross! Ross! My child has no father!'
Ross	 Hi! I\xc2\x92m so glad you\xc2\x92re here, but it\xc2\x92s gonna be a while. I-I\nwished you\xc2\x92d called first.'
Mrs. Geller	 Oh that\xc2\x92s all right, I\xc2\x92m coming back later with your\nfather.'
Ross	 Oh good.'
Mrs. Geller	 I actually needed to talk to you before the birth.'
Ross	 Okay, what\xc2\x92s up?'
Mrs. Geller	 I brought something that I want to give you, assuming of course\nthat you want it. (She holds up an engagement ring.)'
Ross	 Ma, you\xc2\x92re asking me to marry you?'
Mrs. Geller	 This is your grandmother\xc2\x92s engagement ring, I want you to give\nit to Rachel.'
Ross	 Mom no, come on! Thank you.'
Mrs. Geller	 Just hear me out!'
Ross	 N-no! Okay? We\xc2\x92ve been through this! We\xc2\x92re not gonna get married\njust because she\xc2\x92s pregnant, okay?'
Mrs. Geller	 Honestly! Ross, this isn\xc2\x92t just some girl you picked up in a\nbar and humped. A child should have a family.'
Ross	 Mom, y\xc2\x92know what? I-I can\xc2\x92t deal with this right now. I\xc2\x92m\nsorry\xc2\x85'
Mrs. Geller	 Just\xc2\x85think about it. If you don\xc2\x92t, I\xc2\x92ll talk more\nabout humping.'
Ross	 Gimmie! (Takes the ring and puts it in his coat pocket as Rachel enters\nthe hallway.)'
Rachel	 Hi!'
Mrs. Geller	 Oh hi dear!'
Rachel	 Oh, thank you so much for coming. Ross, get in here!'
Ross	 \xc2\x85she came and dragged me out of the labor room to ask me why I\xc2\x92m\nnot with Rachel.'
Phoebe	 Yeah. (Pause) Why aren\xc2\x92t you with Rachel?'
Ross	 Are you kidding? Look, we\xc2\x92re not gonna be together just because\nwe\xc2\x92re having a baby. Okay?'
Phoebe	 But y\xc2\x92know what? It just seems that you two belong together.'
Ross	 Okay, stop it! I can\xc2\x92t deal with this right now. I have to go have a\nbaby.'
Phoebe	 Right. And with who again? (Ross exits.)'
Joey	 God. He\xc2\x92s crazy! Why doesn\xc2\x92t he want to be with Rachel?'
Phoebe	 I know!'
Joey	 I mean seriously, she\xc2\x92s like the perfect woman. I mean I know she\nturned me down, but if she hadn\xc2\x92t and wanted to be with me, I would take her in my\narms and\xc2\x85 (Realizes everyone is staring.) I haven\xc2\x92t bummed you guys out like\nthis in a while have I?'
Ross	 (To Rachel) Hey. Who\xc2\x92s that?'
Rachel	 New people.'
Ross	 What happened to the Disgustingtons?'
Rachel	 They\xc2\x92re having their baby! It\xc2\x92s not fair Ross we got here\nfirst! Right after you left they wheeled her off into delivery. Oh but not before she gave\nme a juicy shot of little Jamie just crowning away.'
Ross	 Wow! Sorry. So uh, how are the new people?'
Rachel	 Well they have uh, some unusual pet names for each other. Including umm,\nevil bitch and uh, sick bastard. Oh God oh! Contraction!'
Ross	 Yeah? Okay.'
Rachel	 Ooh! Ow!!'
Evil Bitch	 Are you looking at her?! '
Sick Bastard	 No!'
Evil Bitch	 Don\xc2\x92t you look at her you sick bastard!'
Sick Bastard	 Honey I swear! I wasn\xc2\x92t looking at her!'
Evil Bitch	 She\xc2\x92s in labor! You like that you sick son of a bitch!'
Ross	 Umm. Umm, I\xc2\x92m-I\xc2\x92m just gonna\xc2\x97(Closes the privacy screen.)'
Evil Bitch	 See? See? It was because you were looking fat pervert!'
Ross	 No-no, I\xc2\x92m\xc2\x85I\xc2\x92m sure no one was looking. Just want some\nprivacy. (He closes the screen and stares wide-eyed at Rachel.)'
Evil Bitch	 You miss your girlfriend?'
Ross	 Just ignore them.'
Rachel	 Ross.'
Ross	 What? What?'
Rachel	 He\xc2\x92s looking at me.'
Ross	 (to him) Hey! You wanna live to see your baby?!'
Evil Bitch	 Don\xc2\x92t you talk to my husband like that you stupid bastard!'
Monica	 Oh good God! If you want a baby so bad just go steal it! '
Monica	 What is going on with you? Since when are you so crazy about babies?'
Chandler	 I\xc2\x92m not crazy about babies. I\xc2\x92m crazy about us.'
Monica	 What?'
Chandler	 Look, we\xc2\x92ve always talked about having babies someday. I\xc2\x92m\nnot saying it has to be right now, but I\xc2\x92m starting to think that we can handle it.\nWe\xc2\x92re good. We\xc2\x92re really good.'
Monica	 We are pretty good.'
Chandler	 But nothing has to happen until your ready.'
Monica	 Well maybe I\xc2\x92m ready now. I mean, it\xc2\x92s a little scary, but\nmaybe it\xc2\x92s right.'
Chandler	 What?! It\xc2\x92s not right! We\xc2\x92re not ready to have a kid now!!'
Monica	 What?!!'
Chandler	 I\xc2\x92m kidding. This is going to be fun.'
Monica	 So we\xc2\x92re gonna try? I mean, are we trying?'
Chandler	 We\xc2\x92re trying to get pregnant. (They start kissing, but Chandler\nstops it.) Y\xc2\x92know I\xc2\x92m not really comfortable doing this in front of the babies.\nSo, when do you want to start trying?'
Monica	 Okay, hold on a sec.'
Chandler	 Period math?'
Monica	 Yeah.'
Chandler	 Yeah.'
Monica	 Well, we could start trying. Now.'
Chandler	 Right here?'
Monica	 No, not here. Maybe here.'
Chandler	 Wait a minute, it\xc2\x92s perfect. We got a lot of time to kill and\nwe\xc2\x92re in a building that\xc2\x92s full of beds!'
Monica	 And it\xc2\x92s so clean!!'

Joey	 Come on you stupid machine! Come on!'
Phoebe	 Oh, it ate your money?'
Joey	 (looking at her) No.'
Phoebe	 All right, I\xc2\x92ll see you downstairs then.'
Joey	 All right.'
Phoebe	 All right.'
Joey	 Hey I got one! I got one!'
Man	 Hi!'
Phoebe	 Hi.'
Man	 Oh uh, up or down?'
Phoebe	 Oh down please. (The guy tries to reach the button, but can\xc2\x92t.) I-I\nhate to be a ball buster can I just do it? (She pushes the button.)'
Man	 Could you press up too please?'
Phoebe	 Sure! I feel so bad for you; I broke my leg once too.'
Man	 Oh yeah? How\xc2\x92d yours happen?'
Phoebe	 Well, it\xc2\x92s a long story. It\xc2\x92s kind of embarrassing. Let\xc2\x92s\njust say there was a typographical error with a sex manual. (The guy laughs.) How about\nyou?'
Man	 Car accident.'
Phoebe	 Oh.'
Man	 Oh, let me guess some idiot on a cell phone wasn\xc2\x92t paying attention?'
Man	 Yeah. Me. (The elevator door opens.) Oh hey, that\xc2\x92s me. (Rolls onto\nthe elevator.) Hey uh, I take it you\xc2\x92re just visiting someone.'
Phoebe	 Uh-huh, yeah.'
Man	 Well umm, if you have sometime y\xc2\x92know and maybe you might want to\nvisit someone else\xc2\x85'
Phoebe	 Oh yeah! I-I would like that.'
Man	 I\xc2\x92m in the middle\xc2\x85 (The elevator door closes, cutting him off.)'
Phoebe	 Wait! What?! No!! Elevator!! No!'
Joey	 (standing behind her) Uh, you gotta press the button. (Does so.)'
Ross	 The nurse said they\xc2\x92re bringing in another woman.'
Rachel	 Ugh, is she pregnant yet? She doesn\xc2\x92t need to be; she\xc2\x92ll still\nhave the baby before I do. Oh Ross, another contraction! (Leans back on Ross for some\nsupport.)'
Ross	 That\xc2\x92s it. That\xc2\x92s it.'
Woman	 Oooh, that sounded like a bad one.'
Rachel	 Yeah it was.'
Woman	 Mine haven\xc2\x92t been so bad. Oh! Here comes one now. (Hums then squeals\na little bit.) Oh, that was a big one!'
Phoebe	 (to the nurse) Excuse me? Could you help me with something? The patient\nI\xc2\x92m looking for has a broken leg and is in a wheelchair. And umm, he\xc2\x92s like\nearly to mid-thirties, very attractive.'
Nurse	 I think I know who you\xc2\x92re talking about.'
Phoebe	 Oh yay! Great! Okay, what room number is he in?'
Nurse	 I\xc2\x92m sorry, that information is restricted to hospital staff\xc2\x85'
Joey	 (walks up) Uh, she\xc2\x92s with me. (Introduces himself) Dr. Drake Remoray.'
Nurse	 Dr. Drake who?'
Joey	 Remoray. It\xc2\x92s Portuguese. We need that information; I\xc2\x92m a\ndoctor.'
Nurse	 A doctor at this hospital?'
Joey	 Damnit woman we\xc2\x92re losing precious time! Now do you want this\nman\xc2\x92s blood on your head?'
Phoebe	 Hands.'
Joey	 Hands! It is absolutely essential that you tell me what room the man my\nassistant described is staying in. He\xc2\x92s a patient of mine, I\xc2\x92ve been treating\nhim for years!'
Nurse	 He\xc2\x92s in room 816.'
Joey	 816, thank you! '
Phoebe	 Thank you. (Starts to exit.)'
Joey	 And what is his name?'
Phoebe	 (coming back for Joey) No! (Grabs Joey and drags him away.)'
Monica	 I think we found a place.'
Chandler	 Okay. (They start kissing.)'
Monica	 Umm, wait! Do you want to set the mood a little?'
Chandler	 Okay. Uh, we\xc2\x92ll dim the lights, dim the lights. (He goes to the\nlight switch and finds it\xc2\x92s not a dimmer switch when he flips the lights off.) Or\nturn them out all together. Uh, no scented candles. Okay here. Here we go. (He sprays an\naerosol air freshener above her.)'
Monica	 Okay! Okay! Make me sterile, but okay.'
Monica	 Okay. Let\xc2\x92s hurry\xc2\x97Oh wait! Do we have a condom? (He looks at\nher.) Oh right! (Laughs and they resume making out when a nurse catches them in the act.)'
Chandler	 Yes, 98.6. You\xc2\x92re gonna be fine.'
Phoebe	 Ooh, this is it! (Looks in the window.) Oh, that\xc2\x92s him! That\xc2\x92s\nhim!'
Joey	 Great! Go get him.'
Phoebe	 Wait a second, or maybe you can go in first.'
Joey	 (looks in the window) He\xc2\x92s not really my type.'
Phoebe	 No not you, Dr. Drake Remoray. You can ask him questions and see\nwhat\xc2\x92s he like. People tell doctors everything.'
Joey	 But you said he was this great guy!'
Phoebe	 But lately all the guys I meet seem really nice at first, then they turn\nout to be the biggest jerks.'
Joey	 You do attract some stinkers.'
Rachel	 Dr. Long, I\xc2\x92ve been at this for seventeen hours! Three women have\ncome and gone with their babies, you gotta give me some good news! How many centimeters am\nI dilated? Eight? Nine?'
Dr. Long	 Three.'
Ross	 Just three?! I\xc2\x92m dilated three!'
Dr. Long	 We are moving along, just slowly. (Rachel lies back and sighs.)\nDon\xc2\x92t worry, you\xc2\x92re doing great. I\xc2\x92ll be back soon. (Exits.)'
Rachel	 Hey, y\xc2\x92know what? I\xc2\x92m not waiting! I\xc2\x92m gonna push this\nbaby out! I\xc2\x92m doing it! I mean it\xc2\x92s what? Three centimeters? That\xc2\x92s gotta\nbe like this! (Holds her hands a couple inches apart.)'
Ross	 Actually it\xc2\x92s more like this. (Pushes her hands to less than an inch\napart.)'
Rachel	 Oh stupid metric system!'
Doctor	 Oh my. We\xc2\x92re gonna need to take you straight to the delivery room.'
Rachel	 Oh for the love of God! '
Woman Giving Birth	 (yelling from the hallway) It\xc2\x92s coming! It\xc2\x92s\ncoming!'
Doctor	 And here it is! (The baby cries.)'
Rachel	 Oh come on!!'
Joey	 Hi! I\xc2\x92m Dr. Drake Remoray and I have a few routine questions I need\nto ask you.'
Man	 Really? I\xc2\x92ve been dealing with Dr. Wells.'
Joey	 I know, but I\xc2\x92m a neurologist. And just to be on the safe side, Dr.\nWells wanted a more comprehensive overview of you status so he sent me.'
Man	 Dr. Wells is a woman.'
Joey	 That was a test. Good response. All right, full name.'
Man	 Clifford Burnett.'
Joey	 Date of birth? '
Cliff	 November 16th, 1968.'
Joey	 Age?'
Cliff	 Can\xc2\x92t you figure that out based on my date of birth?'
Joey	 I\xc2\x92m a doctor Cliff, not a mathematician.'
Cliff	 I\xc2\x92m 33.'
Joey	 Okay. And uh, are you married.'
Cliff	 No.'
Joey	 Oh really? So, 33 and still single, would you say you have commitment\nissues?'
Cliff	 Are all the questions this personal?'
Joey	 (checking the list) Yes.'
Cliff	 Well uh if you must know I\xc2\x92m a widower.'
Joey	 Oh that\xc2\x92s terrible. I\xc2\x92m-I\xc2\x92m really sorry.'
Cliff	 Yeah.'
Joey	 Hmm. Do you sleep with women and never call them again?'
Cliff	 No.'
Joey	 Excellent! Excellent! And uh, finally, are you into any weird stuff\ny\xc2\x92know, sexually?'
Cliff	 No!'
Joey	 Oooh, wrong answer. (Exits.)'
Nurse	 (calling to the woman) This room\xc2\x92s available.'
Rachel	 Okay! Okay wait! You listen to me! You listen to me! Since I have been\nwaiting four women, that\xc2\x92s four, one higher than the number of centimeters that I am\ndilated, have come and gone with their babies! I\xc2\x92m next! It\xc2\x92s my turn! It\xc2\x92s\nonly fair! And if you bring in one woman and she has her baby before me I\xc2\x92m going to\nsue you! Not this hospital, I\xc2\x92m going to sue you! And my husband (Points at Ross)\nhe\xc2\x92s a lawyer!'
Ross	 Uh Rach\xc2\x85'
Rachel	 Go get back on that case honey!'
Nurse	 I don\xc2\x92t think the next patient is very far along.'
Rachel	 Okay, well then bring her in.'
Woman	 OH\xc2\x85.MY\xc2\x85.GAWD!!! (Uh-huh, it\xc2\x92s Janice.)'

Janice	 I\xc2\x85.can\xc2\x92t\xc2\x85.believe this!'
Ross	 And yet somehow it\xc2\x92s true!'
Janice	 I mean this is so great! We\xc2\x92re gonna be baby buddies! (Does the\nlaugh.)'
Ross	 (To Rachel) Squeeze your legs together and cover the baby\xc2\x92s ears!'
Man	 (entering, carrying a pillow) Hi sweetie!'
Janice	 Hi! Hi sweetheart! This is my husband Sid, I don\xc2\x92t think\nyou\xc2\x92ve met him. Ross, Rachel, this is Sid. I nabbed him a year ago at the\ndermatologist\xc2\x92s office. Thank God for adult acne huh? (Does the laugh.)'
Sid	 I still can\xc2\x92t believe it! I\xc2\x92m the luckiest guy in the world!'
Ross	 (softly) Really?'
Sid	 (To Janice) What\xc2\x92d he say?'
Janice	 Oh y\xc2\x92know what? You have to speak very loudly when you\xc2\x92re\ntalking to Sid, because he\xc2\x92s almost completely deaf.'
Rachel	 Oh!'
Ross	 Oh there you go!'
Rachel	 I get it!'
Janice	 So? Congratulations you two, I didn\xc2\x92t even know you got married.'
Rachel	 Oh we-we didn\xc2\x92t.'
Ross	 No-no. We\xc2\x85'
Janice	 What?!'
Ross	 Um uh\xc2\x85We\xc2\x92re-we\xc2\x92re just having this baby together but uh, uh\nthat\xc2\x92s all.'
Janice	 Why?!!'
Ross	 Uh well umm\xc2\x85we\xc2\x92re just not in that place, y\xc2\x92know? But\nwe\xc2\x92re very excited about this.'
Janice	 Oh. Well then shut me up. (Does the laugh.)'
Rachel	 Just tell me how.'
Janice	 Uh-oh, I feel another one coming. (She makes a sound like a goose during\nthe contraction.)'
Ross	 Sid you lucky deaf bastard.'
Phoebe	 What else? What else?'
Joey	 Uh, well he\xc2\x92s 33.'
Phoebe	 Oh. Ah-uh.'
Joey	 A widower.'
Phoebe	 Oh.'
Joey	 He seemed like a stand up guy. Oh, and he\xc2\x92s not into anything weird\nsexually.'
Phoebe	 Enter Pheebs.'
Chandler	 Should we tell Rachel there\xc2\x92s an empty private room right next\ndoor to hers?'
Monica	 We could, or we can have sex in it.'
Chandler	 Well let me think about that, while I remove my pants!'
Monica	 (lying down on the bed) Okay mister! Fertilize me!'
Monica	 Does that sound like Janice?'
Chandler	 If it\xc2\x92s not, then there\xc2\x92s two of them. And that would mean\nit\xc2\x92s the end of the world!'
Monica	 Hey!'
Ross	 Hey!'
Chandler	 Hi.'
Rachel	 Oh hi.'
Monica	 I can\xc2\x92t believe this is taking so long. How are you doing?'
Rachel	 Oh not bad. Do you know that feeling when you\xc2\x92re trying to blow a\nSaint Bernard out your ass?'
Chandler	 Weirdest thing. Did I hear\xc2\x97(A nurse opens the privacy screen and\nChandler sees Janice)\xc2\x97Mother of God it\xc2\x92s true!'
Janice	 Chandler Bing!'
Chandler	 Jan-Janice!'
Ross	 Not just Janice, Janice in labor, contracting and everything.'
Janice	 Oh, this should be easy. I have a very wide pelvis. You remember\nChandler.'
Chandler	 Janice I didn\xc2\x92t even know you were pregnant! Who\xc2\x92s the\nunwitting human who\xc2\x92s essence you\xc2\x92ve stolen?'
Janice	 It\xc2\x92s you. This is yours.'
Chandler	 What?!'
Janice	 (laughs) Look how nervous he gets! We haven\xc2\x92t slept together in\nyears! (Laughs again.)'
Chandler	 That\xc2\x92s funny. Does it-does it hurt? Does the labor hurt?'
Phoebe	 Okay I\xc2\x92ve got one for you, if you had too which one would you\nrather eat, a seeing eye dog or a talking gorilla?'
Cliff	 I\xc2\x92d have to say\xc2\x85the talking gorilla, because at least I can\nexplain to him that you\xc2\x92re making me eat him.'
Phoebe	 Somebody went to college. Wow. (Cliff gets uncomfortable) What is it?\nI\xc2\x92m sorry. (She moves her arm, which was resting on the same pillow his leg is.)'
Cliff	 No, I\xc2\x92m sorry. It\xc2\x92s just my foot itches like crazy.'
Phoebe	 Oh, I\xc2\x92ll get it. (She gets up and grabs a spoon.)'
Cliff	 Wow! I usually get to know a girl a little better before I let her spoon\nme.'
Phoebe	 Relax, it\xc2\x92s not like we\xc2\x92re forking.'
Rachel	 Oh that\xc2\x92s five Ross. Five women have had five babies! And I have\nhad no babies! Why doesn\xc2\x92t she want to come out?'
Ross	 Y\xc2\x92know what I think it is? I think you\xc2\x92ve made such a nice home\nfor her over the last nine months that she just doesn\xc2\x92t want to leave.'
Rachel	 Oh. Look at you making up crap for me. Oh God! (Starts another\ncontraction as Dr. Long enters.)'
Dr. Long	 Twenty-one hours, you\xc2\x92re a hero.'
Rachel	 Doctor you gotta do something! I think you gotta give me drugs or you\ngotta light a fire up in there and just smoke it out.'
Dr. Long	 Actually, I think you\xc2\x92re ready to go to the delivery room.'
Rachel	 What?'
Dr. Long	 Ten centimeters, you\xc2\x92re about to become a mom.'
Rachel	 My God. Okay. (Another woman enters.) Ha-ha-ha beat ya! Sucker!'
Cliff	 Is this the same spoon that was in my cast? (Smells it.)'
Phoebe	 Y\xc2\x92know what? This one is. (Eats another spoonful of pudding as\nCliff sees something on TV.)'
Cliff	 Oh my God! That\xc2\x92s the doctor who was in my room before!'
Phoebe	 Huh. Okay, Mr. Perkazet.'
Cliff	 I\xc2\x92m telling you! The guy from that show was here in my room, asking\nme all these weird questions!'
Phoebe	 Cliff, do you really believe that a character from a TV show was here in\nyour room?'
Joey	 (entering) Rachel\xc2\x92s having her baby!! (Phoebe turns and looks at\nhim.) Which is of no interest to me, I\xc2\x92m a neurologist.'
Cliff	 That-that\xc2\x92s him! You know him?'
Phoebe	 Okay. Okay. I\xc2\x97Okay umm\xc2\x85this\xc2\x85I-I sent my friend Joey in\nhere to find out stuff about you. Umm y\xc2\x92know, if it helps you came off great. A lot\nbetter than I\xc2\x92m coming off right now.'
Cliff	 I don\xc2\x92t believe this. You got him to pretend he was some fake\ndoctor?'
Joey	 Fake? Excuse me? Hello? (Taps the TV screen.)'
Cliff	 And then you tried to make me think that I was crazy.'
Phoebe	 You\xc2\x92re right, that was wrong. I\xc2\x92m sorry. I\xc2\x92m so sorry.\nIt\xc2\x92s just that I liked you so much. Can we just, can we just start over?'
Cliff	 I don\xc2\x92t think so.'
Joey	 Uh, if I may? Umm-umm look, Cliff, you told me a lot of personal stuff\nabout you, right? And maybe-maybe it would if-if would help if-if you knew some personal\nstuff about her. Uh, she was married to a gay ice dancer. Uh, she gave birth to her\nbrother\xc2\x92s triplets. Oh! Oh! Her-her twin sister used to do porn!'
Phoebe	 Uh Joey, we\xc2\x92re trying to dial down the crazy.'
Joey	 Right!'
Phoebe	 Umm, look we don\xc2\x92t, we don\xc2\x92t really know each other so it\nwould be really easy to just forget about this, but there seems to be something between\nus. And I don\xc2\x92t know about you but that doesn\xc2\x92t happen to me a lot.'
Cliff	 It doesn\xc2\x92t happen to me either.'
Joey	 Me neither.'
Dr. Long	 Push. Push. Come on push for five seconds. 5\xc2\x854\xc2\x85'
Rachel	 3-2-1 oh!!'
Dr. Long	 Okay, the next contraction should be in about twenty seconds.'
Rachel	 I can\xc2\x92t. I can\xc2\x92t push anymore, I can\xc2\x92t.'
Ross	 Sweetie you\xc2\x92re doing great.'
Rachel	 Oh God twenty seconds my ass!!'
Dr. Long	 Here we go! Okay, keep pushing! Wait! I see something.'
Ross	 What? You do? You do? (Looks) Oh my God!'
Rachel	 Don\xc2\x92t say, "Oh my God!" Oh my God what?'
Ross	 What is that?'
Dr. Long	 It\xc2\x92s the baby\xc2\x92s buttock, she\xc2\x92s breech.'
Ross	 Oh thank God, I thought she had two heads.'
Rachel	 Oh God. Is she gonna be okay?'
Dr. Long	 She\xc2\x92s gonna be fine. Okay, she\xc2\x92s in a more difficult\nposition so you\xc2\x92re gonna have to push even harder now. Go! Push!'
Ross	 Go!'
Dr. Long	 Rachel you\xc2\x92re gonna have to push even harder, nothing\xc2\x92s\nhappening!'
Rachel	 I\xc2\x92m sorry, I can\xc2\x92t!'
Ross	 Yes you can!'
Rachel	 I can\xc2\x92t!'
Ross	 Hey! Hey! Come on! You can! I know you can do this! Let\xc2\x92s go!'
Rachel	 I can\xc2\x92t. Please, you do it for me.'
Ross	 No! Come on let\xc2\x92s\xc2\x97One more time! One final push! Ready?\n1\xc2\x852\xc2\x853! (Rachel pushes so hard her head snaps up head-butting Ross and knocking\nhim down.)'
Dr. Long	 Good!'
Ross	 (from the floor) Keep pushing!'
Rachel	 Are you okay?'
Ross	 You have no idea how much this hurts. (All of the women in the room turn\nand glare at him.) Keep going! Keep going!'
Dr. Long	 Here we go!'
Ross	 Oh! Oh! She\xc2\x92s upside down but she\xc2\x92s coming! She\xc2\x92s coming!'
Rachel	 Oh God!'
Ross	 Oh! Oh my God oh! Oh my God she\xc2\x92s here.'
Ross	 Oh she\xc2\x92s\xc2\x85she\xc2\x92s perfect.'
Rachel	 Oh, she\xc2\x92s so tiny. (Starts crying) Where\xc2\x92d she go?'
Ross	 Oh it\xc2\x92s okay. They\xc2\x92re just-they\xc2\x92re just wrapping her up.'
Rachel	 Okay. Well be careful with her, she\xc2\x92s really tiny.'
Dr. Long	 Here she is!'
Rachel	 Oh hey you. Thanks for coming out of me. (The baby cries.) I know. Oh.\nYeah. Oh, she\xc2\x92s looking at me. Hi! I know you.'
Dr. Long	 Do we have a name yet?'
Rachel	 No, not yet.'
Dr. Long	 That\xc2\x92s fine, for now we\xc2\x92ll just call her Baby Girl Green.'
Rachel	 Oh no, Baby Girl Geller-Green.'
Rachel	 Hello baby girl.'

Phoebe	 Can we come in?'
Ross	 Oh, come in.'
Phoebe	 Hi!'
Joey	 There she is!'
Phoebe	 Oh, she\xc2\x92s so beautiful.'
Rachel	 Here. (Hands her to Monica.)'
Monica	 Oh my God! She\xc2\x92s amazing. Oh, oh I\xc2\x92m so glad you guys got\ndrunk and had sex!'
Chandler	 It\xc2\x92s incredible, I mean one minute she\xc2\x92s inside you and then\n47 hours later here she is.'
Joey	 (taking the baby) She looks so real! (The gang looks at him.) Y\xc2\x92know\nwhat I mean! She\xc2\x92s this whole tiny little person. She already has eyelashes and knees\nand\xc2\x85uh-oh.'
Rachel	 What?'
Joey	 Oh no-no, no for I second there I counted six fingers, but one was from\nthe other hand so we\xc2\x92re good.'
Phoebe	 Okay, my turn. My turn. (Joey hands her to Phoebe.) Oh! You\xc2\x92re so\ncute! Oh, I could squeeze your little head! (Pause) I won\xc2\x92t.'
Monica	 What\xc2\x92s the matter?'
Rachel	 Oh nothing I\xc2\x85 Sorry, I just can\xc2\x92t stop crying.'
Ross	 The doctor says it\xc2\x92s completely normal with all the hormones. Plus,\nyou-you\xc2\x92re sleep deprived.'
Rachel	 So? You guys are all sleep deprived. I don\xc2\x92t see you weeping\nbecause you put your slippers on the wrong feet. Oh God. (Starts to cry harder.)'
Joey	 What\xc2\x92s the matter now?'
Rachel	 I was reliving it.'
Phoebe	 Ohhh. (Hands her back to Rachel.)'
Chandler	 So, do you know what you\xc2\x92re gonna call her yet?'
Phoebe	 Oh, wait a minute it\xc2\x92s not gonna be Baby Girl? I thought that was\nso original! '
Ross	 Uh actually, we-we\xc2\x92ve narrowed it down to two names.'
Rachel	 Yeah, and y\xc2\x92know what? I love them both, so why don\xc2\x92t you just\npick one and that\xc2\x92ll be it.'
Ross	 Wow! Umm, okay uh\xc2\x85everyone\xc2\x85this\xc2\x85is Isabella. (Rachel starts\ncrying.) What?'
Rachel	 That\xc2\x92s not her name! I\xc2\x92m sorry, she just doesn\xc2\x92t feel\nlike an Isabella.'
Chandler	 So then I guess Ferdinad is out.'
Joey	 What was the other one Ross?'
Ross	 Umm, Delilah.'
Rachel	 Oh great! Suddenly she sounds like a biblical whore.'
Ross	 So I guess we\xc2\x92re back to uh, Baby Girl.'
Phoebe	 Yay!'
Rachel	 Well what are we going to do?'
Monica	 It\xc2\x92s okay honey, you\xc2\x92ll find a name.'
Ross	 Ugh, easy for you to say, you already know what your kids names are going\nto be.'
Chandler	 You do?'
Monica	 Yeah, I\xc2\x92ve had them picked out since I was fourteen.'
Chandler	 Oh no, it\xc2\x92s gonna be named after some snack or baked good\nisn\xc2\x92t it?'
Rachel	 Well tell us! What are they?'
Monica	 Umm, okay. If it\xc2\x92s a boy it\xc2\x92s Daniel.'
Rachel	 And if it\xc2\x92s a girl?'
Monica	 I don\xc2\x92t want to say.'
Rachel	 Oh, just tell us! We\xc2\x92re not gonna want it!'
Monica	 Okay. It\xc2\x92s Emma.'
Rachel	 (gasps) Emma! (Looks at the baby and starts to cry.) See? I don\xc2\x92t\nwant it.'
Monica	 Take it.'
Rachel	 What?'
Monica	 It\xc2\x92s clearly an Emma.'
Rachel	 Oh honey, but you love that name.'
Monica	 Yeah, but I love you more. Besides y\xc2\x92know, nothing goes with Bing.\nSo I\xc2\x92m screwed. I mean\xc2\x85 (Rachel hands Emma to Monica.) Oh, hi Emma. Yeah,\nthat\xc2\x92s you. You\xc2\x92re our little Em. Oh what\xc2\x92s that honey? What? Oh, you want\na little cousin? (To Chandler) You want a cousin right now?!'
Chandler	 That was amazing.'
Monica	 I know. Hey, do you realize we may have just changed our lives forever?\nWe may have just started a family. Nine months from now we can be here, having our own\nbaby.'
Chandler	 And if not, we got to do it on a bucket.'
Janice	 (entering) Yoo-hoo! Aaron Litman-Neurolic would like to say hello to his\nfuture bride.'
Rachel	 Ohhh! (Looks at Aaron and recoils in horror.) Wow! He kinda takes your\nbreath away doesn\xc2\x92t he?'
Janice	 He\xc2\x92s a keeper. How are you feeling?'
Rachel	 Oh, I\xc2\x92m fine. (Gasps in pain as she sits down.)'
Janice	 Can I just say, I really admire what you\xc2\x92re doing. Just raising her\nall alone.'
Rachel	 Oh, I\xc2\x92m not doing it alone. I have Ross.'
Janice	 Oh, sure. Now. But what happens when he meets somebody else and gets\nmarried?'
Rachel	 Well then he gets a divorce, it\xc2\x92s Ross!'
Janice	 I\xc2\x92m telling you Rachel, listen to Janice. They all say they\xc2\x92re\ngonna be there until they start their real family.'
Rachel	 Well I\xc2\x97That\xc2\x92s never gonna happen with Ross.'
Janice	 Oh well that\xc2\x92s what I thought about my first husband, now I\xc2\x92m\nlucky if my kid gets to spend the weekend with her father and the twins and little Ms. New\nBoobs.'
Rachel	 Really?'
Janice	 I hate to be the one to say it, but honey you two (Her and Emma) are on\nyour own.'
Rachel	 Well\xc2\x85 That\xc2\x92s\xc2\x85y\xc2\x92know\xc2\x97That\xc2\x92s\xc2\x97We\xc2\x92ve\nbeen alone for the last twenty minutes we\xc2\x92re doing okay. Besides y\xc2\x92know what?\nI-I\xc2\x97Maybe we won\xc2\x92t be alone, \xc2\x91cause lately I-I\xc2\x97things have been\nhappening between me and Ross, y\xc2\x92know? Right before I went into labor, we-we had this\nkiss. Y\xc2\x92know? So it might be the\xc2\x85the beginning of something.'
Ross	 (entering) Hey Janice!'
Janice	 Oh hi!'
Ross	 Who\xc2\x92s this little guy? (Gasps when he sees Aaron.)'
Janice	 Say hello to Aaron, your future son-in-law.'
Ross	 No-no. No.'
Janice	 I\xc2\x92m gonna leave the three of you alone.'
Ross	 Okay.'
Janice	 Bye. (Exits.)'
Ross	 Man! Did you see the kid on that nose?'
Rachel	 Uh-huh. (Ross takes off his coat and sets in on a chair.) Y\xc2\x92know\nwhat I was, I was thinking about?'
Ross	 Huh?'
Rachel	 Umm\xc2\x85that kiss before we left the apartment. That was some-something\nhuh?'
Ross	 Yeah. Yeah, it really was. But we\xc2\x85we gotta be careful. We\xc2\x85we\ncan\xc2\x92t let that happen again, y\xc2\x92know?'
Rachel	 (pause) Right.'
Ross	 I mean we don\xc2\x92t want to go down that road do we?'
Rachel	 No! No, of course not. No. That\xc2\x92s why I brought it up. (Pause) They\ndidn\xc2\x92t have any sodas?'
Ross	 Oh my God! I\xc2\x92m sorry, I was talking to this nurse, completely forgot.'
Rachel	 That\xc2\x92s all right. (He goes to get her a soda.) And so it begins.'
Phoebe	 Is she in there?'
Ross	 Yeah. She\xc2\x92s putting her down now, that\xc2\x92s her. (Points to the\nnurse putting Emma now.)'
Phoebe	 Oh!'
Ross	 Look at Emma!'
Phoebe	 I just can\xc2\x92t decide who she looks more alike, you or Rachel?'
Ross	 Oh what are you kidding? She\xc2\x92s gorgeous, it\xc2\x92s all Rachel.'
Phoebe	 I\xc2\x92m sorry, for the last time, why aren\xc2\x92t you two together\nagain? (Silence from Ross.) No, I know. I know, because you\xc2\x92re not in that place.\nWhich would be fine, except you totally are.'
Ross	 It\xc2\x92s\xc2\x85it\xc2\x92s complicated okay?'
Phoebe	 Yeah that\xc2\x92s true. Yeah, you love her. You always have. You have a\nchild together. There is no right answer.'
Ross	 Look, we\xc2\x92ve been together. Okay? And then apart, and then together,\nand then apart, and now we have a baby. (Pause) It\xc2\x92s just if-if we got together again\nand it didn\xc2\x92t work out\xc2\x85I could never do that to Emma. I mean she-she thinking\neverything\xc2\x97(Starts to cry.) Oh that\xc2\x92s\xc2\x85now me. What do they put something in\nthe water in this place? Since Rachel and I we\xc2\x92re doing really, we\xc2\x92re doing\nreally well right now.'
Phoebe	 I know. I know. I know. I know, and if you try to make it more you might\nwreck it.'
Ross	 Yeah, exactly.'
Phoebe	 Right. (Pause) Or you might get everything you\xc2\x92ve wanted since you\nwere fifteen.'
Joey	 Hey. I just saw a woman breast feeding both of her twins at the same time;\nit is like a freak show up here. (Notices she\xc2\x92s wiping her eyes.) What\xc2\x92s the\nmatter?'
Rachel	 Nothing.'

Rachel	 Really it\xc2\x92s nothing. I\xc2\x92m just\xc2\x85'

Rachel	 Oh please, he\xc2\x92ll be with his real family, the twins and little miss\nnew boobs.'
Joey	 Okay, how long was I watching that woman?'
Rachel	 I\xc2\x92m just saying that y\xc2\x92know, someday Ross is gonna meet\nsomebody and\xc2\x85he\xc2\x92s gonna have his own life. Right?'
