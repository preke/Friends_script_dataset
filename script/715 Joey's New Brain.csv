Monica	 I\xc2\x92m glad you\xc2\x92re here, we have a couple of things to ask you\nabout the wedding ceremony.'
Rachel	 (starting to cry) Ohh\xc2\x85'
Ross	 What\xc2\x92s the matter? You okay?'
Rachel	 Yeah, it\xc2\x92s just y\xc2\x92know\xc2\x85'
Chandler	 (To Ross) Monica said wedding.'
Monica	 Uh, so anyway, we thought one of you could read something during the\nceremony.'
Rachel	 Oh! I would love to read a poem.'
Chandler	 Do you think you could get through a poem?'
Rachel	 (crying) It\xc2\x92ll be a short one.'
Monica	 Okay, so Ross will be doing the reading.'
Rachel	 Ohhh\xc2\x85'
Ross	 Okay. Yeah, I guess, I guess I could do that too.'
Chandler	 Too?'
Ross	 Yeah, I kind of uh, have something else planned for you guys.'
Monica	 Do you mind telling us what it is?'
Ross	 Sorry, I\xc2\x92m kinda keeping this one on the Q.T.'
Chandler	 Well, whatever it is, I hope it involves winking. (Winks in a spy-type\nmanner.)'
Joey	 (entering, excited) Hey!'
All	 Hey!'
Joey	 So I just talked to one of the DOOL writers today, and\xc2\x85'
Monica	 What is DOOL?'
Joey	 Days Of Our Lives. Anyway, you\xc2\x92re not gonna believe it! My\ncharacter is coming out of his coma!!'
All	 Oh!!'
Chandler	 That\xc2\x92s great!'
Joey	 And-and-and not only that, I\xc2\x92m gettin\xc2\x92 a new brain!!'
Chandler	 So great things are happening at work and in your personal\nlife!'
Rachel	 Wait, what do you mean you\xc2\x92re getting a new brain?'
Joey	 Oh well, they\xc2\x92re killing off one of the characters on the show, and\nwhen she dies her brain is being transplanted into my body.'
Ross	 What? A brain transplant?!'
Joey	 (seriously) Yes, it\xc2\x92s a highly controversial procedure.'
Ross	 It\xc2\x92s ridiculous!'
Joey	 Well, I think it\xc2\x92s ridiculous that you haven\xc2\x92t had sex in three\nand a half months.'
Ross	 (to Monica and Rachel) It\xc2\x92s winter, they are fewer people on the\nstreet. (Rachel and Monica smile and nod, knowingly.)'
Monica	 Who are they killing off?'
Joey	 Uh Cecilia Monroe, she plays Jessica Lockhart.'
Rachel and Monica	 Noo!!'
Monica	 She\xc2\x92s my favorite character on DOOL.'
Joey	 Nice.'
Rachel	 She is so good at throwing drinks in people\xc2\x92s faces, I mean I\ndon\xc2\x92t think I\xc2\x92ve ever seen her finish a beverage.'
Monica	 And the way she slaps all the time!'
Rachel	 Oh!'
Monica	 Wouldn\xc2\x92t you love to do it just once?! (Raises her hand towards\nChandler.)'
Chandler	 Don\xc2\x92t do it.'
Rachel	 Cecilia Monroe man, what a great actress.'
Joey	 Oh, tell me about it. And she\xc2\x92s been on the show forever, it\xc2\x92s\ngonna be really hard to fill her shoes.'
Ross	 Yeah-yeah, help me out here, when you come out of the "brain\ntransplant," you are going to be her?'
Joey	 Yes, but in Drake Remoray\xc2\x92s body. (Ross laughs unbelievably.) Why is\nthis so hard for you to get? I thought you were a scientist!'

Phoebe	 (Clears Throat) Rach, so, that guy there. Straight or gay?'
Rachel	 (They both look behind them.) Well, I'd have to say gay."
Phoebe	 Yeah? Why?'
Rachel	 Well mainly because he's kissing that other guy."
Phoebe	 Oh no not that guy there. That guy right there. (Pointing to an\nattractive man sitting at a table behind them.)'
Rachel	 Oh yeah he's too cute to be straight."
Phoebe	 (A woman with large breasts walks in the door) Ohh knockers will help us\nfigure it out. (She walks by and he checks her out.)'
Rachel	 All right, straight, and not subtle. (The man gets up and leaves.)'
Phoebe	 Ohh, he left his cell phone.'
Rachel	 Oh, well, we can hand it to Gunther and he'll put it in lost and found."
Phoebe	 Or we could use it to call China. See how those guys are doing.'
Rachel	 What if, um, if he calls his own cell phone to find out who found it and\nI answer and we start talking and we fell in love. I mean wouldn't that be a great story?\nKind of like a fairy tale for the digital age."
Phoebe	 Yeah\xc2\x85 That does sound great. I'm going to get the phone. (They both\nget up.)"
Rachel	 What? Wait! Why\xc2\x85why do you get the story?'
Phoebe	 I don't know. I haven't been out on a date in so long."
Rachel	 Phoebe, you had a date three days ago.'
Phoebe	 That wasn\xc2\x92t a date! That was, that was just friends getting\ntogether\xc2\x85(quietly) having sex.'
Rachel	 Okay. Okay, see? I get the phone.'
Phoebe	 No way! No way! You just broke with Tag a week ago.'
Rachel	 Yeah! (Breaking up) And until now, I didn\xc2\x92t think I\xc2\x92d love\nagain.'
Phoebe	 Nice try.'
Rachel	 Oh hey-hey wait! How do we fairly decide who gets the phone?'
Phoebe	 I don\xc2\x92t know. '
Rachel	 Well umm, maybe we could uhh\xc2\x85 (Grabs the phone) Ah-ha! Too slow!! '
Phoebe	 Ah-ha! Too cocky!'
Dina	 I\xc2\x92m going to keep dating him Mother, and there\xc2\x92s nothing you can\ndo about it!'
Jessica Lockhart	 Oh yes there is!'
Dina	 What are you going to do? Kill him? Like you did with Charles?!'
Jessica Lockhart	 (gasps) That was an accident! And so were you.'
Dina	 Well, at least I\xc2\x92m not a murderer! (Jessica slaps her.)'
Jessica Lockhart	 (crying) Oh, my baby! (Hugs Dina, but moves Dina\xc2\x92s head\nto her other shoulder so that she\xc2\x92s the only one in the picture.)'
The Director	 Cut!'
Joey	 That was a great scene! And-and-and that slap looks so real! How do you do\nthat?'
Cecilia	 Oh, just years of experience.'
Dina	 (crying) Can I get some ice here?!'
Joey	 Oh anyway, I just wanted to say how wonderful I think you are.'
Cecilia	 You\xc2\x92re not the fan who\xc2\x92s dying are you?'
Joey	 Say what?'
Cecilia	 I\xc2\x92m supposed to meet and hug a fan whose dying, but that\xc2\x92s\nnot supposed to be until (to no one in particular) later!'
Joey	 No. No, I\xc2\x92m Joey Tribbiani; we did a scene together yesterday.\nI-I\xc2\x92m the guy in the coma!'
Cecilia	 Oh that was a real person?!'
Joey	 An-an-anyway I-I just wanted to say that since I\xc2\x92m getting your brain\nwhen you leave the show, I was wondering if there was any tips you can give me\xc2\x85'
Cecilia	 I-I-I\xc2\x92m leaving the show?'
Joey	 (quickly) I don\xc2\x92t know. Why? Did you hear something?'
Cecilia	 Who told you that?'
Joey	 Oh uh, one of the writers.'
Cecilia	 Which one? Was it bald or was it tall?'
Joey	 Umm\xc2\x85'
Cecilia	 Y\xc2\x92know what? It doesn\xc2\x92t matter! Because it is not true!'
Joey	 Okay.'
Cecilia	 And if it were true, how dare you come to me ask me for tips\nabout a character that I\xc2\x92ve been playing for 20 years\xc2\x97I\xc2\x92ll give you a tip!\n(She throws her drink in his face.)'
Joey	 Ms. Monroe\xc2\x85 (She slaps him) Oh there you go. (She storms off, leaving\nJoey standing next to Dina. They share a nod at the ferocity of the slap they just\nreceived.)'
Rachel	 No Phoebe! You cannot get the phone that way; that\xc2\x92s not fair! Okay\nlook, I have an idea. Why don\xc2\x92t we, why don\xc2\x92t we see what kind of number he has\non his speed dial, and then from that we can tell who has more in common with him. And\nthen whoever does gets the phone.'
Phoebe	 Or, we can decide by whose ever name is closer to the word phone.'
Rachel	 I don\xc2\x92t think so.'
Phoebe	 (handing Rachel the phone) Fine all right, but I\xc2\x92d bet you\xc2\x92d\nbe singing another tune if we were fighting over a ratchet.'
Rachel	 (checking the speed dial) All right, first name on the speed dial is\nmom.'
Phoebe	 Ohh, I lost my mom to suicide.'
Rachel	 Okay no way, you cannot use that to get the cute guy and the last\nblueberry muffin.'
Phoebe	 Did I use that already today? I\xc2\x92m sorry.'
Rachel	 Yes okay. (Checking the speed dial again.) Well now see this isn\xc2\x92t\ntelling us anything. (Reading the speed dial) Joe. Carlos. Peter. Ooh! Peter Luger! T\nhat\xc2\x92s a steak house!'
Phoebe	 Okay, a meat eater. Fine, that\xc2\x92s one for you.'
Rachel	 (looking at the speed dial) Oh, I win! He\xc2\x92s got Barney\xc2\x92s\non his speed dial.'
Phoebe	 So you don\xc2\x92t know that\xc2\x92s Barney\xc2\x92s the store! That\ncan be y\xc2\x92know his friend\xc2\x92s house, or a bar. Who has Barney\xc2\x92s the\nstore on their speed dial?'
Rachel	 (showing Phoebe her phone) His new girlfriend!'
Monica	 What is that?'
Chandler	 I think it\xc2\x92s the dying cat parade.'
Monica	 It sounds like it\xc2\x92s coming from across the street.'
Chandler	 (turning around and looking) Oh my God!'
Monica	 What?'
Chandler	 Y\xc2\x92know that thing that Ross was gonna do at our wedding?! He was\nhanging out with me yesterday and he turned to me and said, "You\xc2\x92re half\nScottish right?"'
Monica	 Nooo!!'
Chandler	 Yes!!'

Monica	 No, there is no way! It can not be Ross! (She looks through the\nwindow and sees Ross practicing and fumbling around with the pipes.) Unbelievable! Why\nis your family Scottish?!'
Chandler	 Why is your family Ross?!'
Monica	 He cannot play at our wedding! I mean everyone will leave! I mean come\non, that is just noise! It\xc2\x92s not even a song!'
Chandler	 If you listen very carefully, I think its Celebration by Cool\nand the Gang.'
Rachel	 Hi Pheebs!'
Phoebe	 Hi!'
Rachel	 How are ya?'
Phoebe	 Good.'
Rachel	 Umm Pheebs, remember when we were in the coffee house we decided that I\nwas going to keep the uh, the cute guy\xc2\x92s cell phone?'
Phoebe	 Yeah.'
Rachel	 And remember how I said I was going to keep it in my purse so that if it\nrang I could just pick it up?'
Phoebe	 Yeah!'
Rachel	 And do you remember going into my purse and stealing the phone?!'
Phoebe	 Ooh, now you lost me.'
Rachel	 You stole the phone!'
Phoebe	 No I didn\xc2\x92t!'
Rachel	 No? So you\xc2\x92re saying that if I called it, it wouldn\xc2\x92t ring?'
Phoebe	 No.'
Rachel	 Umm, okay. But while you dial, let me show you the features of my new\nringing handbag. (Rachel dials her phone and Phoebe\xc2\x92s bag starts to ring.) Oh, it\ndoes work! (Rachel grabs the phone and takes it out of Phoebe\xc2\x92s handbag.)'
Rachel	 Phoebe!'
Phoebe	 That is a different phone.'
Rachel	 Oh is it?! (She answers the cute guy\xc2\x92s phone.) Uhh, hello? (On her\nphone) Yes hi, is Rachel there? (On the other phone) Yes she is, just one moment please.\n(To Phoebe, holding out both phones.) It\xc2\x92s for me!'
Phoebe	 That is damning evidence.'
Rachel	 Oh my God! I bet that\xc2\x92s him. My digital fairy tale is about to\nbegin. I wonder how I should be? Should I be uh (In a sexy voice) Hello? Or should I be\n(Happily) Hi! It\xc2\x92s Rach\xc2\x85 (Phoebe knocks the phone out of Rachel\xc2\x92s hand,\ncatches it, and answers it.) Would you stop doing that?!'
Phoebe	 (on phone) Hello? (Listens) Yes, I\xc2\x92m the one who found your phone.'
Rachel	 Phoebe! You can\xc2\x92t do th\xc2\x85'
Phoebe	 (To Rachel) Shhh! I\xc2\x92m on a call! (On phone) Umm well yeah, you can\npick it up tonight, say 8
Rachel	 You do know that I will be here when he comes over.'
Phoebe	 Oh? And how will you know what time to come over?'
Rachel	 You just said it!'
Phoebe	 Oh. Okay, well I-I was kinda hoping that I would just\xc2\x85be alone\ny\xc2\x92know to think about my mom and her suicide.'
Rachel	 Oh Phoebe!'
Phoebe	 What?! That\xc2\x92s the first time today!'
Rachel	 Ohh! (Exits.)'
Joey	 So you like the nachos uh? Myself I\xc2\x92m partial to\xc2\x85'
Dina	 (interrupting) I\xc2\x92m 16.'
Joey	 See you in 2003. (She walks away.)'
Cecilia	 (walking up) You\xc2\x92re absolutely right they are writing me out of\nthe show. They don\xc2\x92t know exactly when it\xc2\x92s going to happen, but apparently\ngoing to be very soon and that\xc2\x92s it.'
Joey	 I\xc2\x92m so sorry. Look, if it was up to me you would never leave the\nshow.'
Cecilia	 Yeah, thanks.'
Joey	 No I mean it! I can\xc2\x92t believe they would do this to you! And to your\nfans! I mean they are going to be devastated! Heart broken! They love you so much!'
Cecilia	 Oh you\xc2\x92re right. Thank you! What\xc2\x92s your name again?'
Joey	 Joey.'
Cecilia	 Joey, well thank you. That is so sweet. Oh, excuse me. (She throws her\ndrink on a passing writer.)'
The Writer	 It wasn\xc2\x92t my decision!'
Cecilia	 (to him) I\xc2\x92m having a conversation here! (To Joey) You were\nsaying?'
Joey	 Uh yeah-ye-ye-ye-ye-ye\xc2\x97l-l-l-l-l-look the-the-the only reason that I,\nthat I came up to you before was because well, I\xc2\x92m really nervous about-about being\nyou. Y\xc2\x92know if you can help me capture the essence of the character. Y\xc2\x92know?\nHelp me keep Jessica alive. Please?'
Cecilia	 All right Joey, I will help you. Not because I-I owe it to this stupid\nshow, but because I owe it to Jessica.'
Joey	 Oh that\xc2\x92s great! Oh thank you so much!'
Cecilia	 You\xc2\x92re so welcome.'
Joey	 Hey! Now, I\xc2\x92ve been watching some tapes, how\xc2\x92s this? (In a\nBritish accent.) "Jessica Lockhart will never step foot in this place again!\nEver!!"'
Cecilia	 Is that supposed to be me?'
Joey	 Yeah.'
Cecilia	 Yeah but Jessica doesn\xc2\x92t have an English accent.'
Joey	 (shocked) I can do an English accent?! That baby\xc2\x92s going on my\nresume!'
Chandler	 Well, I feel like a snack!'
Monica	 Do you want some shortbread? Eh that\xc2\x92s Scottish like you are.'
Chandler	 Oh no thanks. I don\xc2\x92t like any thing from my Scottish\nheritage.'
Ross	 What?!'
Chandler	 Well it\xc2\x92s just my entire family was run out of Scotland\nby\xc2\x85Vikings. Anyway, lots of bad memories. (Makes a few unintelligible noises.)'
Ross	 Oh well, it sounds to me like your family is ready to uh, rediscover its\nScottish roots.'
Monica	 No! No-no they\xc2\x92re not. They\xc2\x92re still very angry! But\ny\xc2\x92know Chandler is also half-Swedish. You know what the Swedish people are famous\nfor? Sitting down and being quiet.'
Ross	 Well yeah-yeah the Scottish history is so much more\xc2\x85'
Monica	 (interrupting) You can not play bagpipes at the wedding!!'
Ross	 How did you know about that?!'
Chandler	 We heard you play all the way from your apartment!'
Ross	 Were you the ones called the cops?!'
Chandler	 That\xc2\x92s not really important right now. What is important is;\nwhile we appreciate the gesture, we just don\xc2\x92t feel bagpipes are appropriate for our\nwedding.'
Ross	 Why not?'
Chandler	 Because we hate them.'
Ross	 Come on that\xc2\x92s not fair! I mean you haven\xc2\x92t even heard me play!'
Chandler	 We have heard you play.'
Ross	 No, you\xc2\x92ve heard my practice. Okay? Just-just give me a chance to\nperform for you and then decide whatever you want. And I\xc2\x92m not going to tell you what\nsong I\xc2\x92m gonna play either. But uh, let\xc2\x92s just say when it\xc2\x92s over I\xc2\x92ll\nbet there will be a we bit o\xc2\x92 celebration.'
Cecilia	 So, the essence of the character is rooted in her confidence. So, when\nJessica enters a room for instance, she owns everything and every person in that room.\n(Joey is nodding.) You try.'
Joey	 Okay! (He scurries out the set door and re-enters, extremely impressed)\nAll right!'
Cecilia	 No, he already knows that he owns everything in the room! He\xc2\x92s not\nfinding it out for the first time! So, try it again.'
Joey	 Okay. Okay. (He goes out and comes back in, glaring at everything.)'
Cecilia	 Right. He\xc2\x92s not angry at the room either. Try it again, he owns\nit! He owns the room. It is his. He owns, owns, owns, owns the room! He owns it!!\n(Joey gets a snooty look on his face.) All right, it\xc2\x92s a little weird, but it\xc2\x92s\ngetting better. (Joey is pleased.) Oh well, I\xc2\x92m gonna miss this woman so much. I\ndon\xc2\x92t know what I\xc2\x92m going to do! I mean, it\xc2\x92s been 20 years of my life.'
Joey	 Oh well\xc2\x97Hey-hey! Maybe, maybe uh, maybe this is a good thing.\nY\xc2\x92know? It\xc2\x92ll-it\xc2\x92ll give you a chance to shake things up, play different\ncharacters. You\xc2\x92re so talented.'
Cecilia	 I am. I am, but I don\xc2\x92t know you know. An actor of a certain age\nis not that easy.'
Joey	 Hey that\xc2\x92s not true! Look at uh, look at Angela Lansb\xc2\x97Angelina\nJolie!'
Cecilia	 I probably should\xc2\x92ve just left years ago when the offers were\npouring in, but y\xc2\x92know I just got so comfy here! And\xc2\x85 Ohh, I turned down some\namazing work!'
Joey	 Like-like what?'
Cecilia	 Well, let\xc2\x92s just say if I left 15 years ago, the landscape of\nMexican cinema would be very different today!'
Joey	 (impressed) Wow!'
Cecilia	 But\xc2\x85 Well now, now\xc2\x92s a different time for me. (Starts to\ncry.)'
Joey	 Oh hey come on, don\xc2\x92t-don\xc2\x92t-don\xc2\x92t do this! Umm, look\nlet-let me tell you something, okay? Now when I watch you do a scene, I\xc2\x92m thinking,\n"Boy, she-she is a great actress!" (She\xc2\x92s not buying it.) Uh but-but, I am\nalso thinking, "She is hot!"'
Cecilia	 (intrigued) You think I\xc2\x92m hot?'
Joey	 You own the room. (She smiles and stares longingly into his eyes.) We\nshould probably get-get uh\xc2\x85'
Cecilia	 Oh yeah-yeah, we should get the\xc2\x85 (Pause) So when Jessica kisses a\nman, she usually puts umm, both her hands on the man\xc2\x92s face. (She does so.)'
Joey	 Yeah-yeah, I noticed that! Is that \xc2\x91cause she\xc2\x92s so passionate?'
Cecilia	 No! It\xc2\x92s because that way the camera only sees her! (She takes her\nhands off his face.) Do you wanna try it?'
Joey	 Yeah! Okay. (He puts his hands on her face and they kiss.)'
Cecilia	 That was good, that was really good. But I-I think your hands maybe a\nlittle off, they should be maybe right like\xc2\x85 (She grabs the back of his neck and\nkisses him passionately causing them to fall onto the couch.)'

Rachel	 Hey! Hey!'
Phoebe and Rachel	 (simultaneously) Who is it?'
Phoebe	 Whoa! Why do you get to answer the door?'
Rachel	 Well why shouldn\xc2\x92t I?!'
Phoebe	 Because it\xc2\x92s my apartment!'
Rachel	 Well, then I get to give him the cell phone.'
Phoebe	 Okay. All right. (Hands her the phone.) Good luck explaining all the\ncalls to China.'
Tom	 Hi!'
Phoebe	 (To Rachel) Wow! How long were we arguing for?'
Rachel	 (laughs) You\xc2\x92re not the man who left the cell phone.'
Tom	 No that\xc2\x92s my assistant.'
Rachel	 Is-is he coming? (Looks hopefully out the door.)'
Tom	 Umm, no.'
Phoebe	 Could you-could you umm, give us one second?'
Tom	 Sure!'
Rachel	 We\xc2\x92ll be right back sir.'
Tom	 Sure.'
Phoebe	 Wh-what do we do?'
Rachel	 I don\xc2\x92t know!'
Phoebe	 Can you believe this? (Rachel exhales in amazement.) We were waiting for\na hot guy and then an even hotter one shows up!'
Rachel	 I know! (Realizes what Phoebe said.) What?!'
Phoebe	 Hmm, they just don\xc2\x92t make \xc2\x91em like that anymore!'
Rachel	 (turning and looking at Tom again) No-no they do but, you just have to\nwait.'
Phoebe	 Rachel, listen\xc2\x97I mean, if you let me have him then I will really\nowe you one.'
Rachel	 (fake disappointment) All right. All right Phoebe I will let you have\nhim, but you owe me; you owe me big!'
Phoebe	 Yeah! You\xc2\x92re such a great friend!'
Rachel	 Ohh\xc2\x85'
Tom	 So, which one of you lovely ladies am I going to take to dinner huh?'
Phoebe	 Oh that\xc2\x92d be me. Sir. (Hands him the cell phone.) After you.'
Tom	 Okay. Okay. (Exits and Phoebe checks him out.)'
Phoebe	 (whispering) Nice!'
Cecilia	 Well, you certainly own that room.'
Joey	 Actually I rent the whole place and, I just got what you meant. Thank you.'
Rachel	 Hi.'
Joey	 Hey!'
Rachel	 Oh my God! Oh my God!! Ohh, Jessica Lockhart!! In my apartment!! I am\nsuch a huge fan! I am such a huge fan!'
Cecilia	 Well, it\xc2\x92s nice to know that you\xc2\x85'
Rachel	 (screaming) MONICA!!!! MONICA!!!! (Runs to Monica\xc2\x92s.)'
Joey	 That uh, that is my roommate Rachel.'
Cecilia	 Oh that explains all the women\xc2\x92s underwear.'
Joey	 (shrugs) Sure. Yep.'
Monica	 (entering with Rachel) Oh my God! It\xc2\x92s true!! Oh my God you are so\namazing! Oh my God, can I just ask you to do me oh, just one favor?'
Cecilia	 Certainly.'
Monica	 Would you slap me? Would you slap me right here in the face?! (Points to\nher cheek.)'
Cecilia	 I\xc2\x92d love to, but my lawyer said I can\xc2\x92t do that anymore.'
Rachel	 God. You seem really, really nice.'
Joey	 Okay, bye-bye.'
Rachel	 I mean n-not-not fake at all like most famous people.'
Joey	 All right, here we go. (He grabs them and starts to pull them out of the\napartment.)'
Rachel	 Okay.'
Monica	 (breaks away) Oh wait, just one more thing! One more minute! (To\nCecilia) Umm, you\xc2\x92re a stupid bitch.'
Cecilia	 I really can\xc2\x92t slap you. (Monica walks away angrily)'
Rachel	 You are so beautiful.'
Monica	 Nice to meet you! My God you\xc2\x92re great!'
Joey	 Thanks for stopping by. See ya! (Throws them out and closes the door.) (To\nCecilia) I-I am so sorry. I\xc2\x85'
Cecilia	 Oh no-no-no-no, being adored. I\xc2\x92m used to it, don\xc2\x92t worry\nabout it.'
Joey	 (notices something in the mail that Rachel brought in) Oh my God!'
Cecilia	 What?'
Joey	 They sent me today\xc2\x92s script! They never send the script!'
Cecilia	 They don\xc2\x92t?'
Joey	 Well no, I\xc2\x92m just in a coma. This must mean I have lines! (Realizes\nwhat that means.) Oh\xc2\x85'
Cecilia	 How does it happen?'
Joey	 (flipping to the last page) Ew, you get thrown from a horse into an\nelectric fence.'
Cecilia	 Ah what?! Jessica hates horses!'
Joey	 Yeah well, I\xc2\x92m guessing after this she\xc2\x92s not going to be crazy\nabout electricity either.'
Ross	 \xc2\x85now remember you have to imagine me in a kilt.'
Rachel	 (giggles) (To Ross) I can imagine you in a short plaid skirt and knee\nsocks.'
Ross	 (To Rachel) Do you wanna start telling secrets?'
Rachel	 No!'
Ross	 (stands up) Now umm, remember I\xc2\x92m still learning.'
Ross	 One, two, three, four!'
Ross	 You know the song! Sing along!'
Ross	 So?'
Monica and Chandler	 No!'
Dina	 Loosening the saddle on mother\xc2\x92s horse was brilliant Fredrick. And\nthe electric fence, inspired.'
Fredrick	 Thank you sweetheart. (They clink glasses.)'
Dina	 I can\xc2\x92t believe she\xc2\x92s really gone. Look around you, all of this\nis ours. (They move into kiss but; they\xc2\x92re stopped by Joey entering with a huge\nbandage wrapped around his head.)'
Joey	 (as Jessica) I don\xc2\x92t think so.'
Dina	 Who are you?!'
Jessica Lockhart	 What\xc2\x92s the matter Dina? Don\xc2\x92t you recognize your own\n(Does a hair flip) mother?!'
Cecilia	 (running out to Joey) That was so wonderful! (Hugs him) Ohh, I think\nthat you\xc2\x92re a better Jessica than I ever was!'
Joey	 Oh noo\xc2\x85'
Cecilia	 Well of course not, but you were very good.'
Joey	 Thanks!'
Cecilia	 And guess what? Good news! I got another job!'
Joey	 Great! Hey! All right! Well-well what is it?!'
Cecilia	 A film in Guadalajara!'
Joey	 The airport?'
Cecilia	 No that\xc2\x92s La Guardia. (Joey nods in recognition.) This is Mexico.'
Joey	 Ohh. Wow! Well how-how, how will you be gone?'
Cecilia	 Eight months.'
Joey	 That\xc2\x92s a really long time.'
Cecilia	 Yeah, but you can come and visit me. I bet that you could uh, own a few\nplaces down there.'
Joey	 Well I tell ya, I should probably buy a place in the city first.\n(Realizes.) And I just got what you meant again\xc2\x97That is\xc2\x97I tell ya, that is a\ntricky one!'
Cecilia	 That is a tricky one. Well, Joey I really wanna thank you. You\xc2\x92ve,\nwell you made a very difficult time for me a little less painful.'
Joey	 Good luck.'
Cecilia	 You too.'

Ross	 You know the song! Sing along!'
Phoebe	 Eeee!!! Eee!! Eee!! '

Matthew Perry	 Eee!! (This causes more laughter.)'
Lisa Kudrow	 Do it again!'
