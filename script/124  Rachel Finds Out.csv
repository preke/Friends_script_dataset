Ross	 And here's little Ben nodding off..."
Monica	 Awww, look at Aunt Monica's little boy!"
Phoebe	 Oh, look, he's got Ross's haircut!"
Rachel	 Oh, let me see! (grabs picture) Oh, God, is he just the sweetest thing?\nYou must just want to kiss him all over!'
Ross	 (quietly) That would be nice.'
Rachel	 Pardon?'
Chandler	 Nothing, just a little extra air in my mouth. Pffft. Pffffffft. (walks\nover to where Joey is seated)'
Joey	 Hey, Chan, can you help me out here? I promise I'll pay you back."
Chandler	 Oh, yeah, right, OK... inlcuding the waffles last week, you now owe\nme... 17 jillion dollars.'
Joey	 I will, really. I'll pay you back this time."
Chandler	 (sigh)... And where's this money coming from? (gives money to Joey)"
Joey	 Well... I'm helping out down at the N.Y.U. Med School with some...\nresearch."
Ross	 (overhearing) What kind of research?'
Joey	 Oh, just, y'know.... science."
Ross	 Science. Yeah, I think I've heard of that. (everyone's interest is piqued,\nthey all look over)"
Joey	 (sigh)... It's a fertility study."
Monica	 Oh, Joey, please tell me you're only donating your time."
Joey	 Alright, come on you guys, it's not that big a deal. Really... I mean, I\njust go down there every other day and... make my contribution to the project. Hey, hey,\nbut at the end of two weeks, I get seven hundred dollars."
Ross	 Hey.'
Phoebe	 Wow, ooh, you're gonna be making money hand over fist!"
Monica	 OK, we got the cole slaw, we got the buns...'
Phoebe	 We've got the ground-up flesh of formerly cute cows and turkeys, ew...\n(hands meat to Monica)"
Chandler	 (in a deep voice) Men are here.'
Joey	 We make fire. Cook meat.'
Chandler	 Then put out fire by peeing, no get invited back.'
Monica and Phoebe	 Ewww!'
Monica	 Oh Joey, Melanie called, said she's gonna be late."
Joey	 Oh, OK.'
Phoebe	 So how are things going with you two? Is she becoming your\n(provocatively) special someone?'
Joey	 I don't know, she's, uh.... she's pretty great."
Monica	 Yeah? What does she think of your little science project?'
Joey	 What, you think I'm gonna tell a girl I like that I'm also seeing a cup?"
Monica	 Man's got a point."
Joey	 Well, the tough thing is, she really wants to have sex with me.'
Chandler	 Crazy bitch.'
Joey	 Yeah, well, I still got a week left to go in the program, and according to\nthe rules, if I want to get the money I'm not allowed to conduct any... ersonal\nexperiments, if you know what I mean."
Monica	 Joey... we always know what you mean.'
Phoebe	 Hey.'
Monica	 Hey.'
Ross	 Hey. (Phoebe sees his bags)'
Phoebe	 How long did you think this barbecue was gonna last?'
Ross	 I'm going to China. "
Phoebe	 Jeez, you say one thing, and...'
Monica	 You're going to China?"
Ross	 Yeah, i-it's for the museum. Someone found a bone, we want the bone, but\nthey don't want us to have the bone, so I'm going over there to try to persuade them to\ngive us the bo\xc2\x97it's\xc2\x97it's a whole big bone thing. Anyway, I'm gonna be gone for\nlike, uh... like a week, so, uh, if you wanna reach me, y-you can't. So here's my\nitinerary (hands a sheet of paper to Monica). Um... here's a picture of me... (hands it to\nMonica)"
Phoebe	 Oh, let me see! (takes the picture)'
Ross	 (to Monica)
Monica	 Yeah.'
Phoebe	 Hi, Ben. I'm your father. I am... the head. Aaaaaahhhh.... (puts picture\ndown, sees Ross staring at her) Alright, this barbecue is gonna be very fun."
Ross	 Hey, is Rachel here? Um, I wanted to wish her a happy birthday before I\nleft.'
Monica	 Oh no, she's out having drinks with Carl."
Ross	 Oh. (pause) Hey, who's Carl?"
Monica	 You know, that guy she met at the coffeehouse.'
Ross	 No.'
Phoebe	 Oh, well, see, there's this guy she met at the..."
Ross	 At the coffeehouse, right.'
Phoebe	 So you do know who he is! (laughs, Ross stares at her) Sorry.'
Ross	 OK, I'm gonna go say goodbye to the guys."
Phoebe	 Oh, hey, y'know what? Tell them that bone story."
Ross	 Hi.'
Joey	 Hey!'
Chandler	 Hey!'
Ross	 (sigh)....I have to go to China.'
Joey	 The country?'
Ross	 No no, this big pile of dishes in my mom's breakfront. Do you guys know\nwho Carl is?"
Chandler	 Uh, let's see... Alvin... Simon... Theodore.... no."
Ross	 Well, Rachel's having drinks with him tonight."
Joey	 Oh no! How can she do that when she's never shown any interest in you?!?"
Chandler	 Forget about her.'
Joey	 He's right, man. Please. Move on. Go to China. Eat Chinese food."
Chandler	 Course there, they just call it food.'
Ross	 Yeah... I guess. I don't\xc2\x97I don't know. Alright, just... just give her\nthis for me, OK? (gives Chandler a gift for Rachel)"
Joey	 Listen, buddy, we're just looking out for you."
Ross	 I know.'
Joey	 We want you to be happy. And I may only have a couple beers in me, but...\nI love you, man. (Joey gives Ross a hug)'
Chandler	 I'm still on my first. I just think you're nice."
Melanie	 Anyway, that's when me and my friends started this whole fruit basket\nbusiness. We call ourselves 'The Three Basketeers.'"
Joey	 Like the three musketeers, only with fruit.'
Chandler	 (sarcastic) Ooooh. (looks dumbfounded at Joey's stupidity)"
Monica	 (gets up) OK, how does everybody like their burgers?'
Rachel	 Oh, no, no, no. Presents first. Food later. (walks into living room)'
Monica	 Hey, hold on there, tiger. How's it going? How you holding up?"
Joey	 Well, not so good. She definitely thinks tonight is the night we're\ngonna... complete the transaction, if you know what I..."
Joey	 Then you do. Heh, heh.'
Monica	 So, uh, have you ever thought about being there for her?'
Joey	 What do you mean?'
Monica	 Y'know, just be there for her."
Joey	 Not following you.'
Monica	 Think about it.'
Rachel	 OK, I'm guessing this is from..."
Rachel	 Well, thank you, Melanie.'
Chandler	 (pointing out a gift) OK, this one right here is from me.'
Rachel	 (picks it up) OK... ah, it's light... (shakes it)...it rattles...\nit's... (opens it) Travel Scrabble! Oooohhh, thank you! (she gives it back to him)"
Rachel	 This one's from Joey... feels like a book. Thinks it's a book... feels\nlike a book. And...(opens it)...it's a book!"
Phoebe	 Oh, it's Dr. Seuss!"
Joey	 (to Rachel)
Melanie	 There is a little child inside this man!'
Chandler	 Yes, the doctors say if they remove it, he'll die."
Rachel	 Who's this from?"
Chandler	 Oh, that's Ross's. "
Rachel	 Oh... (opens it)... (sees it is a pin) Oh my God. He remembered.'
Phoebe	 Remembered what?'
Rachel	 It was like months ago. We were walking by this antique store, and I saw\nthis pin in the window, and I told him it was just like one my grandmother had when I was\na little girl. Oh! I can't believe he remembered!"
Chandler	 Well, sure, but can you play it on a plane? (pats his Travel\nScrabble game)'
Phoebe	 Oh, it's so pretty. This must have cost him a fortune."
Monica	 I can't believe he did this."
Chandler	 Come on, Ross? Remember back in college, when he fell in love with\nCarol and bought her that ridiculously expensive crystal duck?'
Rachel	 What did you just say?'
Chandler	 (panicked) ahem... um... Crystal duck.'
Rachel	 No, no, no.... the, um, the... 'love' part?"
Chandler	 (stuttering incoherently) F-hah.... flennin....'
Rachel	 Oh.... my God.'
Chandler	 (rubbing his temples) Oh, no-no-no-no-no....'
Joey	 (pats Chandler on the leg) That's good, just keep rubbing your head.\nThat'll turn back time."

Rachel	 I mean, this is unbelievable.'
Phoebe	 I know. This is really, really huge.'
Chandler	 No it's not. It's small. It's tiny. It's petite. It's wee."
Phoebe	 Nuh-uh. I don't think any of our lives are ever gonna be the same ever\nagain."
Chandler	 OK, is there a mute button on this woman?'
Monica	 I think this is so great! I mean, you and Ross! D-did you have any idea?'
Rachel	 No! None! I mean, my first night in the city, he mentioned something\nabout asking me out, but nothing ever happened, so I just... (to Joey)
Joey	 Well, given that he's desperately in love with you, he probably wouldn't\nmind getting a cup of coffee or something."
Rachel	 Ross? All this time? Well, I've got to talk to him. (gets up to leave)"
Chandler	 (quickly) H-He's in China!"
Joey	 The country.'
Monica	 No, no, wait. (checks Ross's itinerary) His flight doesn't leave for\nanother forty-five more minutes."
Chandler	 What about the time difference?'
Monica	 From here to the airport?'
Chandler	 Yes! (Rachel walks towards door) You're never gonna make it!"
Monica	 Rachel, what're you gonna say to him?"
Rachel	 I-I-I don't know."
Chandler	 Well then maybe you shouldn't go. "
Joey	 He's right, cause if you're just gonna, like, break his heart, that's the\nkind of thing that can wait."
Monica	 Yeah, but if it's good news, you should tell him now."
Rachel	 I don't know. Maybe I'll know when I see him."
Phoebe	 Here, look, alright, does this help?'
Rachel	 Noooo... look, all I know is that I cannot wait a week until I see him.\nI mean, this is just too big. Y'know, I just, I've just gotta talk to him. I... I gotta...\nOK, I'll see you later. (opens door)"
Chandler	 Rachel, I love you! Deal with me first! (she leaves)'
Ross	 (something in Chinese)'
Flight Attendant	 Alright!'
Ross	 Ni-chou chi-ma! (walks onto jetway)'
Rachel	 Ross! Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me....'
Flight Attendant	 Hi!'
Rachel	 Hi.'
Flight Attendant	 May I see your boarding pass?'
Rachel	 Oh, no, no, I don't have one. I just need to talk to my friend."
Flight Attendant	 Oh, oooh. I'm sorry. You are not allowed on the jetway unless\nyou have a boarding pass."
Rachel	 No, I know, but I\xc2\x97he just went on. He's right there, he's got the\nblue jacket on, I... can I j-just..."
Flight Attendant	 No no no! Federal regulations!'
Rachel	 OK, alright, OK, um... then could you please, uh... just give him a\nmessage for me? Please? This is very important.'
Flight Attendant	 Alright. What's the message?"
Rachel	 Uh... I don't know."
Flight Attendant	 Sir? Sir? Excuse me, sir? Uh... I have a message for you.'
Man	 (confused) What?'
Flight Attendant	 It's from Rachel. She said that she loved the present, and she\nwill see you when you get back."
Man	 (to wife)
Melanie	 Mmmmmm... Oh, Joey, Joey, Joey... I think I blacked out there for a\nminute!'
Joey	 Heh, heh. It was nothin'."
Melanie	 Well, now we've gotta find something fun for you! (she starts kissing\nhis chest)"
Joey	 (panicked) Uhhh.. y'know what? Forget about me. Let's, uh... let's give\nyou another turn."
Melanie	 (surprised) M-Me again?'
Joey	 Sure! Why not?'
Melanie	 Boy, somebody's gonna get a big fruit basket tomorrow."
Melanie	 Oooh, I gotta tell you... you are nothing like I thought you would be.'
Joey	 How do you mean?'
Melanie	 I don't know, I-I guess I just had you pegged as one of those guys\nwho're always 'me, me, me.' But you... you're a giver. You're like the most generous man I\never met. I mean... you're practically a woman."
Monica	 Uh, so, uh, Rach, uh... do you wanna save this wrapping paper, I mean,\nit's only a little bit torn... so are you gonna go for it with Ross or should I just throw\nit out?"
Rachel	 I don't know. I don't know... I thought about it all the way there, and\nI thought about it all the way back... and, uh, oh, you guys, y'know, it's Ross.\nY'know what I mean? I mean, it's Ross."
Monica and Phoebe	 Sure.'
Rachel	 I don't know, I mean, this is just my initial gut feeling... but I'm\nthinking... oh, I'm thinking it'd be really great."
Monica	 Oh my God, me too! Oh! Oh, we'd be like friends-in-law! Y'know what the\nbest part is? The best part is that you already know everything about him! I mean, it's\nlike starting on the fifteenth date!"
Phoebe	 Yeah, but, y'know, it's... it would be like starting on the fifteenth\ndate."
Monica	 Another good point.'
Phoebe	 No, I mean, I mean, when you're at the fifteenth date, y'know, you're\nalready in a very relationshippy place. Y'know, it's... you're committed."
Rachel	 (confused) Huh?'
Phoebe	 Well, I mean, then what happens if it doesn't work out?"
Monica	 Why isn't it working out?"
Rachel	 I don't know... sometimes it doesn't."
Monica	 Is he not cute enough for you?'
Rachel	 No!'
Monica	 Does he not make enough money?'
Rachel	 No, I'm just...."
Phoebe	 Maybe there's someone else."
Rachel	 Wha...'
Monica	 Is there? Is there someone else?'
Rachel	 No! There is.. there is noone else!'
Monica	 Then why the hell are you dumping my brother?!?'
Chandler	 Hey, big...'
Joey	 Shhhh!'
Chandler	 (quietly) ...spender.'
Joey	 She's still asleep."
Chandler	 So how'd it go?"
Joey	 Oh, it was amazing. You know how you always think you're great in bed?"
Chandler	 The fact that you'd even ask that question shows how little you know\nme."
Joey	 Well, it's like, last night, I couldn't do the thing that usually makes me\ngreat. So I had to do all this other stuff. And the response I got... man, oh man, it was\nlike a ticker tape parade!"
Chandler	 Yes, I know, as it happens my room is very very close to the parade\nroute.'
Joey	 It was amazing! And not just for her... uh-uh. For me, too. It's like, all\nof a sudden, I'm blind. But all my other senses are heightened, y'know? It's like... I was\nable to appreciate it on another level."
Chandler	 I didn't know you had another level."
Joey	 I know! Neither did I!'
Monica	 Hey, great skirt! Birthday present?'
Rachel	 Yeah.'
Monica	 Oh, from who?'
Rachel	 From you. I exchanged the blouse you got me.'
Monica	 Well, it's the thought. Hey, doesn't Ross's flight get in in a couple\nhours? At gate 27-B?"
Rachel	 Uh, yeah. Uh, Monica, y'know, honey, I've been thinking about it and\nI've decided this\xc2\x97this whole Ross thing, it's just not a good idea."
Monica	 Oh, why?'
Rachel	 Because, I feel like I wouldn't just be going out with him. I would be\ngoing out with all of you. Oh, and there would just be all this pressure, and I don't\nwanna..."
Monica	 (gets up) No, no, no, no, no, no pressure, no pressure!'
Rachel	 Monica, nothing has even happened yet, and you're already so..."
Monica	 I am not 'so'! OK, I was a teensy bit weird at first, but... I'll be\ngood. I promise."
Rachel	 Who is it?'
Intercom	 It's me, Carl."
Rachel	 C'mon up."
Monica	 Behind my brother's back? (Rachel glares at her) ... is exactly the kind\nof crazy thing you won't be hearing from me."
Joey	 Seven hundred bucks!'
Chandler	 Alright, you did it! Do we have any fruit?'
Joey	 Man, hell of a two weeks, huh? Y'know what, though? I really feel like I\nlearned something."
Chandler	 Really? So, you're gonna stick with this 'it's all for her' thing?"
Joey	 What, are you crazy? When a blind man gets his sight back, does he walk\naround like this? (Joey closes his eyes and walks around with arms spread.)'
Carl	 I'm just sayin', if I see one more picture of Ed Begley, Jr. in that stupid\nelectric car, I'm gonna shoot myself! I mean, don't get me wrong... I'm not against\nenvironmental issues per se.... it's just that guy!"
Ross	 I can't believe you'd rather go out with him than me."
Rachel	 Would you excuse me, please? I'm trying to have a date here."
Ross	 Fine, just stop thinking about me.'
Ross	 Can't do it, can you?"
Rachel	 So I'm thinking about you. So what?"
Ross	 I don't get it. What do you see in this guy, anyway?"
Rachel	 Well... he happens to be a very nice... guy....'
Carl	 I mean, come on, buddy, get a real car!'
Ross	 Rachel, come on. Give us a chance.'
Rachel	 Ross, it's too hard."
Ross	 No, no, no... why, because it might get weird for everyone else? Who cares\nabout them. This is about us. Look, I-I've been in love with you since, like, the ninth\ngrade. "
Rachel	 Ross, you're like my best friend."
Ross	 I know.'
Rachel	 If we broke up, and I lost you...'
Ross	 Whoa, whoa, whoa. What makes you think we're gonna break up?"
Rachel	 Well, have you been involved with someone where you haven't broken up?"
Ross	 (pause) No. But... it only has to happen once. Look, you and I both\nknow we are perfect for each other, right? I mean... so, the only question is... are you\nattracted to me?'
Rachel	 I don't know... I mean, I've never looked at you that way before."
Ross	 Well, start looking. '
Rachel	 Wow.'
Carl	 Exactly! And you just know I'm gonna be the guy caught behind this\nhammerhead in traffic!"
Rachel	 Right! You're right!"
Carl	 Heh... y'know?"
Rachel	 You know what?'
Carl	 What?'
Rachel	 I forgot... I am supposed to pick up a friend at the airport. I am so\nsorry! I'm so... if you want to stay, and finish your drinks, please do.... (gives him her\ndrink) I mean\xc2\x97I'm sorry. I-I-I gotta go. I'm sorry. "
Carl	 But...'
Rachel	 (sifting through crowd) Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me, excuse me,\nsorry. Hi.'
Man	 For God's sake, will you let it go? There's no Rachel!"
Ross	 Oh, hey, hey, I got that.'
Julie	 Oh, thanks, sweetie.'
Ross	 No problem. I cannot wait for you to meet my friends.'
Julie	 Really?'
Ross	 Yeah. '
Julie	 You don't think they'll judge and ridicule me?"
Ross	 No, no, they will. I just... uh...'
Ross and Julie	 Can't wait."
Ross	 Come on, they're gonna love you."
