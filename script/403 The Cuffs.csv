Joey	 Hey!! We are so in luck! Treeger said that we\ncould have all this cool stuff from the basement. Wait right there. (Goes back into the\nhall)'
Chandler	 Oh no-no-no, I\xc2\x92m, I\xc2\x92m paddling away!'
Joey	 (Returning carrying a couple of rusted lawn chairs) Huh?!'
Chandler	 Wow! Really?! We get all this rusty crap for free?!'
Joey	 Uh-huh. This and a bunch of bubble wrap. And,\nsome of it is not even popped! '
Chandler	 Could we be more white trash?'

Monica	 (Entering from her bedroom) How desperate am I?'
Rachel	 Oh! Good thing Chandler\xc2\x92s not here, he always wins at\nthis game.'
Monica	 I just told my Mom I\xc2\x92d cater a party for her.'
Phoebe	 How come?'
Monica	 Because I need the money, and I thought that it\xc2\x92d be a\ngreat way to get rid of that last little schmidgen of self-respect.'
Ross	 Come on, I think this is a good thing. I don\xc2\x92t think Mom\nwould\xc2\x92ve hired you if she didn\xc2\x92t think you were good at what you do.'
Monica	 You don\xc2\x92t have to stick up for her. She can\xc2\x92t here\nyou.'
Rachel	 (entering) Hey! Umm, do you guys have any juice?'
Joey	 Just pickle.'
Chandler	 Hey uh, Rach, funny story. I ah, bumped into Joanna on the\nstreet yesterday.'
Rachel	 My boss, Joanna? Wow, that must\xc2\x92ve been awkward.'
Chandler	 Well, no, actually she uh, asked me if I wanted to get a\ndrink.'
Rachel	 (laughs) You ah, you didn\xc2\x92t say \xc2\x91Yes\xc2\x92 to that\ndid you?'
Chandler	 (laughs) No. No!'
Joanna	 (Coming out of the shower wearing nothing but a towel) Hello,\nRachel. (She goes into Chandler\xc2\x92s bedroom)'
Chandler	 Well, not at first.'
Rachel	 What is she doing here?'
Rachel	 I don\xc2\x92t understand! Last time you went out with her you\nsaid she was a \xc2\x91big, dull dud.\xc2\x92'
Chandler	 Well, I think I judged her too quickly, and this time we\nwere able to take the relationship to the next level.'
Rachel	 Well, last time I almost got fired. You must end it, you must\nend it now!'
Chandler	 Oh, come on! It\xc2\x92s not like this is an everyday\noccurrence for me! I mean usually I\xc2\x92m pretty much just in there by myself.'
Rachel	 Chandler!! (He turns around quickly) Promise me, you will end\nit.'
Chandler	 Okay, I promise, I\xc2\x92ll end it.'
Rachel	 Thank you.'
Chandler	 I hope you know what I\xc2\x92m giving up for ya, because\nshe\xc2\x92s not just the boss in your office, if you know what I mean.'
Joey	 Yeah-eh-eah! (Rachel glares at him) Oh-oh, sorry, I-I knew what\nhe meant.'
Mrs. Geller	 (entering) How\xc2\x92s the hired help?'
Monica	 Doing great, the quiches are coming along.'
Mrs. Geller	 What\xc2\x92s this? Blue nail polish?'
Monica	 Yeah, I thought it was cute.'
Mrs. Geller	 Ahh, that\xc2\x92s what your Grandmother\xc2\x92s hands\nlooked like when we found her.'
Monica	 Let me ask you a question.'
Mrs. Geller	 Hmm.'
Monica	 Why did you hire me?'
Mrs. Geller	 Oh, well Richard raved about the food at his party, of\ncourse you were sleeping with him. Then I heard the food at that lesbian wedding was very\nnice, I assume you weren\xc2\x92t sleeping with anybody there. Though, at least that would\nbe something. (Leaves)'
Monica	 (to Phoebe) Oh my God! Did you hear that? She hired me because\nshe thinks I\xc2\x92m good.'
Phoebe	 Okay, I didn\xc2\x92t hear that.'
Monica	 Oh yeah, she didn\xc2\x92t hire me out of pity, it wasn\xc2\x92t\nso she could pick on me in front of her friends, she actually thinks I\xc2\x92m good.'
Phoebe	 Wow! And hey, it\xc2\x92s cool if you\xc2\x92re a lesbian! (Gives\nher a thumbs up)'
The Salesman	 (Entering before Joey can say anything) Good afternoon,\nare you the decision maker of the house?'
Joey	 Uhhhh. (He\xc2\x92s not sure)'
The Salesman	 Do you ah, currently own a set of encyclopedias? '
Joey	 No! No. But ah, try the classifieds, people sell everything in\nthere.'
The Salesman	 Actually, I\xc2\x92m not buying. I\xc2\x92m selling. Let me\nask you one question. Do your friends ever have a conversation and you just nod along even\nthough you\xc2\x92re not really sure what they\xc2\x92re talking about?'
Ross	 \xc2\x85I\xc2\x92m telling you it\xc2\x92s totally unconstituional.'
Monica, Chandler, Phoebe, and Rachel	 Oh yeah, I totally agree.'
Monica	 \xc2\x85I think he deserves a Nobel Prize. (Joey starts to nod\n\xc2\x91Yes.\xc2\x92)'
All	 Nooo!! (Joey quickly stops nodding his head.)'
Chandler	 \xc2\x85it was like the Algonquin kids table. (They all laugh,\nbut Joey only laughs not to be left out.)'
The Salesman	 (Interrupting the flashback) Excuse me, I\xc2\x92m sorry,\nyou haven\xc2\x92t said anything for about two and a half minutes, are you at all\ninterested?'
Joey	 Yeah-well-yeah! Yeah-oh-yeah. Come on in.'
Phoebe	 That\xc2\x92s weird.'
Monica	 What?'
Phoebe	 Your nails.'
Monica	 Oh, I know, I never wear fake ones. I just did it so my Mom\nwouldn\xc2\x92t give me grief about me biting them.'
Phoebe	 Oh, no, I meant that it\xc2\x92s weird that you only have nine\nnow.'
Monica	 (Looks at her nails) Oh my God. Wait a minute, I had them\nput\xc2\x85 (realises) Oh my God! It\xc2\x92s in the quiche! Oh My God!'
Phoebe	 Okay, don\xc2\x92t panic. I\xc2\x92m gonna go to the store,\nI\xc2\x92m gonna get you another set of nails, no one\xc2\x92s gonna know, and you\xc2\x92re\ngonna look great. (She runs over to get her coat.) Oh! Oh, it\xc2\x92s \xc2\x91cause\nthey\xc2\x92re gonna eat\xc2\x97that\xc2\x92s the problem.'
Mrs. Geller	 (entering) (to Monica) Honey, don\xc2\x92t bite your nails.'
Monica	 Okay ah, please don\xc2\x92t freak out. Umm, but ah,\nthere\xc2\x92s a blue fingernail in one of the quiche cups, and there\xc2\x92s no way to know\nwhich one.'
Phoebe	 And! Whoever finds it wins the prize!'
Mrs. Geller	 (laughs) I\xc2\x92m not freaking out.'
Monica	 Then why are you laughing?'
Mrs. Geller	 It\xc2\x92s nothing, it\xc2\x92s just that now your Father\nowes me five dollars.'
Monica	 What? You bet I\xc2\x92d lose a nail?'
Mrs. Geller	 Oh no, don\xc2\x92t be silly. I just bet I\xc2\x92d need\nthese. (Opens the freezer to reveal\xc2\x85)'
Monica	 Frozen lasagnas?'
Mrs. Geller	 Um-hmm.'
Monica	 You bet that I\xc2\x92d screw up?! So all that stuff about\nhiring me because I was good was\xc2\x85'
Mrs. Geller	 No-no-no, that was all true. This was just in case you\npulled a Monica.'
Monica	 You promised Dr. Weinburg, you\xc2\x92d never use that phrase.'
Mrs. Geller	 Oh honey, come on, have a sense of humour, you\xc2\x92ve\nnever been able to laugh at yourself.'
Monica	 (laughs) That\xc2\x92s right. My Mom doesn\xc2\x92t have any faith\nin me! Oh, that\xc2\x92s hilarious! Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.'
Phoebe	 I don\xc2\x92t get it.'
Mrs. Geller	 No, I have faith\xc2\x85'
Monica	 (interrupting) No! You have lasagnas! (Storms out and an\nawkward silence follows.)'
Oven	 Ding!'
Phoebe	 Op, the ruined quiches are ready.'
Chandler	 It just doesn\xc2\x92t\xc2\x85feel like we\xc2\x92re breaking up.'
Joanna	 No, we are. I\xc2\x92m sad.'
Chandler	 Okay.'
Joanna	 (answering the phone) Yes. (listens) Uh, can\xc2\x92t you wait\nuntil tomorrow? (listens) All right. (hangs up) Unbelievable!!'
Chandler	 Thanks.'
Joanna	 No, no, that was my boss. I have to go.'
Chandler	 Okay. (Starts to button up his shirt)'
Joanna	 What are you doing?'
Chandler	 I\xc2\x92m getting dressed.'
Joanna	 Why?'
Chandler	 When I walk outside naked people throw garbage at me.'
Joanna	 Wait. I wanna show you something.'
Chandler	 What is it?'
Joanna	 Just a little gag gift somebody gave me. (She\xc2\x92s holding a\npair of handcuffs) Put your hands together.'
Chandler	 Ah-ha, you\xc2\x92re not the boss of me. (She kisses him)\nYeah, you are! (She handcuffs him to the chair) Ooh, saucy.'
Joanna	 (kisses him) I\xc2\x92ll be back in ten minutes. (Starts to\nleave)'
Chandler	 You are, you\xc2\x92re gonna leave me like this?'
Joanna	 Knowing you\xc2\x92re here, waiting for me I think it\xc2\x92s\nkinda exciting.'
Chandler	 Okay. But if you don\xc2\x92t come back soon, (She leaves and\ncloses the door) there\xc2\x92s pretty much nothing I can do about it!'
Joanna	 (locking her door) Oh.'
Sophie	 Hi! I brought you back a macaroon!'
Joanna	 Oh great! I\xc2\x92ll keep it in my butt with your nose. (She\ngrabs the cookie and walks out.)'
Rachel	 That\xc2\x92s weird, she locked the door.'
Sophie	 Y\xc2\x92know why? She\xc2\x92s got the Christmas bonus list in\nthere. I saw her working on it this morning.'
Rachel	 Okay, swear you won\xc2\x92t tell, but when Mark left he gave me\na key to Joanna\xc2\x92s office. Do you wanna see the list?'
Sophie	 Yeah!'
Chandler	 Hi! (to Sophie) How are you?'

Chandler	 Hello, Joanna\xc2\x85(Realises he doesn\xc2\x92t know her last\nname)\xc2\x85\xc2\x92s office.'
Joanna	 (on speaker phone) I\xc2\x92m really sorry but I may be a little\nwhile longer.'
Chandler	 How little?!'
Joanna	 A couple of hours, I feel awful.'
Chandler	 Look, this isn\xc2\x92t funny! You get back here right now!'
Joanna	 I can\xc2\x92t!!'
Chandler	 Why not?!'
Joanna	 I\xc2\x92m in my boss\xc2\x92s car!'
Chandler	 What?!'
Joanna	 Uh-oh, tunnel. (The phone gets cut off)'
Rachel	 (answering it) (angrily) What?!'
Chandler	 (in a serious, businesslike tone) Rachel, could I see you\nfor a moment?'
Chandler	 Okay, here\xc2\x92s the situation. The keys to the cuffs are\non the back of the door. Could you be a doll and grab them and scoot on over and unlock\nme? And on a totally different subject, that is a lovely pantsuit.'
Rachel	 You promised you would break up with her!'
Chandler	 I did break up with her! She just took it really, really\nwell!'
Rachel	 And the fact that you were jeopardising my career never\nentered your mind?!'
Chandler	 It did enter my mind! But then something happened that made\nit, shoot right out.'
Rachel	 Y'know what Chandler, you got yourself into those cuffs, you\nget yourself out of them."
Chandler	 No-no-no-no-no-no-no!! I can\xc2\x92t get myself right out of\nthem! You must have me confused with the Amazing Chandler!! Come on, you have to unlock\nme, she could be gone for hours, and I\xc2\x92m cold, and (Stops and looks up the skirt on a\nstatue behind Joanna\xc2\x92s desk.)'
Rachel	 Oh, Chandler!! All right, this is it! (Grabs the key) You\nnever see Joanna again!'
Chandler	 Never!'
Rachel	 You never come into this office again!'
Chandler	 Fine!'
Rachel	 You give me back my Walkman!'
Chandler	 I\xc2\x97never borrowed your Walkman.'
Rachel	 Well, then I lost it. You buy me one!'
Chandler	 You got it! Here we go! Come on! This is great! (Rachel goes\nover and unlocks the handcuffs) Ahhh! (He starts rubbing his wrist)'
Rachel	 Does it hurt?'
Chandler	 No, I just always see guys doing this when they get\nhandcuffs taken off them. (He runs over to where his pants are hanging) Hello sweet pants!'
Rachel	 Wait a minute! What are you gonna tell Joanna?'
Chandler	 About what?'
Rachel	 When she sees that you\xc2\x92re gone, she\xc2\x92s gonna know\nthat I let you out, and that I was in here, and I\xc2\x92m gonna get fired!'
Chandler	 I\xc2\x92ll make something up! I\xc2\x92m good at lying, I\nactually did borrow your Walkman!'
Rachel	 No, there\xc2\x92s nothing to make up, she\xc2\x92s gonna know\nthat I have a key to her office, I\xc2\x92ve got to get you locked up back the way you were!\n(She tries to drag him over to the chair, but Chandler stops her.)'
Chandler	 Oh-ho-ho, I don\xc2\x92t think so!'
Chandler	 Well, this is much better.'
The Salesman	 So, here\xc2\x92s somebody interesting, Joey. What do you\nknow about Van Gogh?'
Joey	 He cut off his ear.'
The Salesman	 And?'
Joey	 I\xc2\x92m out.'
The Salesman	 He painted that. (Points to one of his paintings in the\nbook)'
Joey	 Wow! That\xc2\x92s pretty nice. I thought he cut off his ear\n\xc2\x91cause he sucked. What else you got in there?'
The Salesman	 Let\xc2\x92s see, ahhh\xc2\x85 Where does the Pope live?'
Joey	 In the woods. No wait-wait, that\xc2\x92s the joke answer.'
The Salesman	 Actually its, Vatican City. Now ahh, what do you know\nabout vulcanised rubber?'
Joey	 Spock\xc2\x92s birth control.'
The Salesman	 (laughs) You need these books.'
Phoebe	 Hey!'
Monica	 Hi.'
Phoebe	 This used to be your room? (She nods \xc2\x91Yes\xc2\x92) Wow! You\nmust\xc2\x92ve been in really good shape as a kid.'
Monica	 Ohh, I\xc2\x92m such an idiot. I can\xc2\x92t believe I actually\nthought she could change.'
Phoebe	 Well, who cares what your Mom thinks? So you pulled a Monica.'
Monica	 Oh good, I\xc2\x92m glad that\xc2\x92s catching on.'
Phoebe	 No but, why does that have to be a bad thing. Just change what\nit means. Y'know? Go down there and prove your Mother wrong. Finish the job you were hired\nto do, and we\xc2\x92ll call that pulling a Monica."
Monica	 What?'
Phoebe	 Okay, umm, if a kid gets straight A\xc2\x92s, his parents would\nsay, "Yeah, he pulled a Monica." Y\'know? Or a fireman saves a baby, and they go,\n"Yeah I know, he pulled a Monica." Or someone hits a homerun and the announcer\nsays, "Yeah, that one\xc2\x92s outta here." Though some things don\xc2\x92t change.'
Monica	 (getting up) All right, I\xc2\x92ll go down there. But, I\xc2\x92m\nnot gonna serve the lasagna. I\xc2\x92m gonna serve something I make.'
Phoebe	 Wow! My breasts are really strong. (She goes and joins\nMonica.)'
Rachel	 Chandler! Chandler, please, I have to get you locked up back\nthe way you were, I am sooo gonna lose my job, she\xc2\x92s very private about her office.\nNow I know why.'
Chandler	 Hey, look, you\xc2\x92re in trouble either way! Okay? If she\ncomes back and sees me locked to this instead of the chair, she\xc2\x92s gonna know you were\nin here. So you might as well just let me go.'
Rachel	 What if I clean your bathroom for a month?'
Chandler	 It still wouldn\xc2\x92t be clean. (Rachel makes an \xc2\x91Eww,\ndisgusting!\xc2\x92 face) All I want is my freedom.'
Rachel	 Foot rubs for a month!'
Chandler	 Freedom!'
Rachel	 I\xc2\x92ll take all of your photos and put them into photo\nalbums!'
Chandler	 Freedom! I want my freedom! Why won\xc2\x92t you here me?!\n(Opens the door) Sophie, help me! Help me!! (Sophie stands up)'
Rachel	 Sophie sit!!'
Rachel	 No! God, would you just calm down!'
Chandler	 I\xc2\x92m gonna say this for the last time. Would you please\njust\xc2\x85 (He moves his arm which opens the drawer and hits in the back of the head,\nwhich proves his point.)'
Joey	 Wow! There\xc2\x92s a lot I didn\xc2\x92t know about vomit. (The\nduck comes to the door of the bathroom, quacking.) (To the duck) In a minute. (The duck\ngoes back into the bathroom.)'
The Salesman	 So, what do you say, Joey? You get the whole set of\nencyclopedias for twelve hundred dollars, which works out to just 50 bucks a book!'
Joey	 Twelve hundred dollars? You think I have $1200? I\xc2\x92m home in\nthe middle of the day, and I got patio furniture in my living room. I guess there\xc2\x92s a\nfew things you don\xc2\x92t get from book learnin\xc2\x92.'
The Salesman	 Well ah, what can you swing?'
Joey	 How about zero down and zero a month for a long, long time?'
The Salesman	 You don\xc2\x92t have, anything?'
Joey	 You wanna see what I got? (He gets up to empty out his pockets)\nOkay? I\xc2\x92ve got a baby Tootsie Roll, a movie stub, keys, a Kleenex, a rock, and an\narmy man. Hey!'
The Salesman	 Okay, I-I get the picture. Uh, thanks, for your time.\n(Starts to leave)'
Joey	 And a 50. (The salesman stops suddenly) Huh, these must be\nChandler\xc2\x92s pants.'
The Salesman	 For 50 bucks, you can get one book! What will it be? A?\nB? C?'
Joey	 Oh, I-I think I\xc2\x92m gonna stick with the V, I wanna see how\nthis bad boy turns out.'
Rachel	 I ah, will buy and wrap all of your Christmas gifts.'
Chandler	 No!'
Rachel	 I ah\xc2\x85 Oh! I\xc2\x92ll squeeze you fresh orange juice every\nmorning!'
Chandler	 With extra pulp?'
Rachel	 (happily) Yeah!!'
Chandler	 No!'
Rachel	 D\xc2\x92oh!! (pause) I\xc2\x92ve got it!'
Chandler	 You don\xc2\x92t have it.'
Rachel	 I have so got it. There\xc2\x92s gonna be\nrumours about this, there\xc2\x92s no way to stop it. Sophie knows, Monica and Phoebe know.'
Chandler	 How do Monica and Phoebe know?'
Rachel	 Oh, I called them. And when they ask me what I saw, I can be\nvery generous (Holds her hands far apart) or very (In a high pitched voice) stingy.'
Chandler	 (intrigued) Go on.'
Rachel	 I can make you a legend. I can make you this generation\xc2\x92s\nMilton Berle.'
Chandler	 And Milton Berle has a\xc2\x85'
Rachel	 Ohh, not compared to you. (Chandler nods in agreement)'
Monica	 Well?'
Phoebe	 They\xc2\x92re not even touching the lasagna!'
Monica	 Really?!'
Phoebe	 Oh, they love your casserole.'
Monica	 Yes!!'
Phoebe	 It\xc2\x92s hard to believe that just a little while ago this\nwas nothing but ingredients.'
Mrs. Geller	 (entering) Well, everyone seems to be enjoying your dish.'
Monica	 And you?'
Mrs. Geller	 I thought it was\xc2\x85 quite tasty.'
Monica	 So if everyone liked it, and you liked it, that would make\nthis a success. Which would make you\xc2\x85'
Mrs. Geller	 (interrupting) A bitch?'
Monica	 Well, I was going for wrong, but we can use your word.'
Mrs. Geller	 Yes, well I was wrong, and I have to say you really\nimpressed me today.'
Monica	 Wow!'
Phoebe	 Umm, you might even say that she pulled a Monica. (They both\nlook at her) (to Monica) She doesn\xc2\x92t know we switched it. (Monica nods her head\n\xc2\x91No.\xc2\x92)'
Mrs. Geller	 And the next time you cater for me, there will be nothing\nbut ice in the freezer. (She starts to bite her nails)'
Monica	 That really means a lot. Oh, and Mom, don\xc2\x92t bite your\nnails.'
Chandler	 (hello) Hello.'
Joey, Rachel, and Ross	 Hey!'
Monica	 (in a sexy voice) Hello, Chandler. (Phoebe has a huge smile on\nher face.)'
Chandler	 (to Rachel) I love you. (Kisses her on the forehead)'
Joey	 Wh-what\xc2\x92s going on?'
Phoebe	 Oh. '
Joey	 No he doesn\xc2\x92t!'
Chandler	 (checks his watch) Two hours, that lasted!'
Rachel	 So did you break up with Joanna?'
Chandler	 I think so.'
Joey	 Well, it\xc2\x92s good thing you got out when you did, before she\nblew up like that Vesuvius.'
Ross	 The volcano?'
Joey	 Yeah. And speaking of volcanoes, man are they a violent igneous\nrock formation.'
Rachel	 What?!'
Joey	 Oh yeah, lava spewing, hot ash, of course some are dormant.'
Monica	 Why are you talking about volcanoes all of the sudden?'
Joey	 Well, we can talk about something else. What do you want to talk\nabout? Vivisection? The Vasdeferens? The Vietnam War?'
Monica	 Oh! Did anybody see that-that documentary on the Korean War?\n(Joey is pissed)'
All	 Oh, yeah. Yeah.'
Phoebe	 Oh God, Korea is such a beautiful country.'
Ross	 With such a sad history.'
Chandler	 Could there be more Kims?'

Joanna	 (from her office) Who\xc2\x92s out there?'
Rachel	 It\xc2\x92s me! Good morning!'
Joanna	 Rachel, could you come in here for a moment, please?'
Rachel	 Yeah, sure. Umm, they didn\xc2\x92t have poppy seed bagels, so\nI\xc2\x85 (Enters Joanna\xc2\x92s office and sees her handcuffed to her chair wearing nothing\nbut a slip) Oh my word!'
Joanna	 I seem to have had a slight office mishap. Could you please\nget the key off the back of the door for me.'
Rachel	 Oh, yeah! Yeah!'
Joanna	 You tell your friend Chandler that we\xc2\x92re definately\nbroken up this time.'
Rachel	 Okay.'
