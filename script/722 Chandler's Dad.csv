Ross	 Hey!'
Monica	 Hey!'
Ross	 Hey uh Mon, I saw the Porsche parked out front, can I get the keys?\nThought I\xc2\x92d take that bad boy out for a little spin.'
Rachel	 Wait a minute! (To Monica) You let Ross drive the Porsche and\nwhen I ask you, you say you\xc2\x92re the only one who\xc2\x92s allowed to drive it.'
Monica	 Yeah, well he\xc2\x92s my brother! And plus he drives so slow he could\nnever hurt it.'
Ross	 It\xc2\x92s a car Monica! Not a rocket ship!'
Monica	 Whatever Ross! Just replace the bulbs in the brake lights after\nyou\xc2\x92re done.'
Joey	 (entering) Hey!'
Ross	 Hey!'
Phoebe	 Hey!'
Joey	 Saw the Porsche out there Mon, lookin\xc2\x92 good. When do I get to take\nthat baby out again?'
Rachel	 (shocked) You let Joey drive it?!'
Phoebe	 I\xc2\x92ve never driven it! Okay? Not once! Okay once. Okay, I drive it\nall the time.'
Monica	 Nice work everybody! So much for the y\xc2\x92know, "You can drive\nit, but don\xc2\x92t tell Rachel" plan!'
Rachel	 Wow! I can\xc2\x92t believe you lied to me.'
Phoebe	 Okay, I can fix this! Okay Monica, Rachel thinks all you can talk about\nis the wedding. (Rachel glares at her.)'
Monica	 Great! Well Rachel, the reason why I won\xc2\x92t let you drive the\nPorsche is because you\xc2\x92re a terrible driver. There! That wasn\xc2\x92t about the\nwedding.'
Ross	 Look Rach if-if you want to go for a ride in the Porsche I\xc2\x92ll be glad\nto take you for a quick spin around the block.'
Joey	 Yeah, you got a couple hours?'

Ross	 Whew! That was a brisk ride!'
Rachel	 Take the top down did ya?'
Ross	 Only way to fly.'
Rachel	 Come on Ross give me the keys! Monica does not know what\nshe\xc2\x92s talking about! I am an excellent driver!'
Ross	 You\xc2\x92re fast and irresponsible. That adds up to a bad driver.'
Rachel	 Well in High School, that added up to head cheerleader.'
Ross	 Did you see the look that girl just gave me? Huh? She must\xc2\x92ve seen me\ncruising in the bad boy.'
Rachel	 I think she\xc2\x92s checking out your beehive Ross.'
Ross	 What?! (Checks his hair.) Give-give me a brush.'
Rachel	 Gimme the keys!'
Ross	 No way!'
Rachel	 Well no brush!'
Ross	 Fine! Y\xc2\x92know what? It doesn\xc2\x92t matter, because, if I remember\ncorrectly, there is a comb on the floor of the bathroom. '
Rachel	 (to the woman) Alimony. (Runs outside.)'
Monica	 Chandler, we still haven\xc2\x92t gotten an RSVP from your dad.'
Chandler	 Oh! Right. Umm, maybe that\xc2\x92s because I didn\xc2\x92t send him an\ninvitation.'
Monica	 Chandler! He\xc2\x92s your father; he should be at the wedding.'
Chandler	 I don\xc2\x92t even know the man. Okay? We\xc2\x92re not the close. I\nhaven\xc2\x92t seen him in years.'
Monica	 Well what are you gonna do when he finds out he wasn\xc2\x92t even asked?!'
Chandler	 Well he doesn\xc2\x92t have to know! It\xc2\x92s not like we run in the\nsame circles. I hang out with you guys, and he stars in a drag show in Vegas.'
Phoebe	 Ooh, I think I wanna trade circles.'
Chandler	 Trust me, you don\xc2\x92t want him there either. Okay? Nobody is gonna\nbe staring at the bride when the father of the groom is wearing a back-less dress.'
Monica	 So what! As long as he\xc2\x92s not wearing a white dress and a veil I\ndon\xc2\x92t care.'
Phoebe	 Okay, I think I need to do some shopping. (Gets up and leaves.)'
Rachel	 Ahhh! (Gets in.) Ooh, nice!'
Rachel	 My God!'
Ross	 What do you think you\xc2\x92re doing?!'
Rachel	 Just washing the windshield. (She turns on the wipers forcing Ross off\nof the hood.)'
Ross	 There is no way I am letting you drive this car! So why don\xc2\x92t\nyou just hand over the keys?'
Rachel	 Oh.'
Ross	 No ah-ah-ah! Do not start this car! (She starts the car.) Okay!\nOkay! I will give you twenty bucks if you get out of this car right now! (He looks for the\ntwenty Rachel stole and doesn\xc2\x92t find it.)'
Rachel	 Look Ross, if you\xc2\x92re so freaked out, just get in the car!'
Ross	 With you?! Yeah right!'
Rachel	 All right. (She starts off.)'
Ross	 (grabbing the car) Okay! Okay! Okay! (He gets in, but into the back seat.)'
Rachel	 What are you doing?! Get in the front!'
Ross	 In the death seat?!!'
Rachel	 Oh my\xc2\x85'
Man	 Hey guys!'
Joey	 Hey!'
Phoebe	 Hey sweetie!'
Man	 Ready to go?'
Phoebe	 Yeah! Sure! Ooh, I left my purse up at Monica\xc2\x92s. I\xc2\x92ll be right\nback. (She goes to get it.)'
Man	 (stopping her) Wait a minute!'
Phoebe	 What? (He leans in to kiss her.) Oh. (They kiss and Phoebe pauses.) Ooh.\n(Pause) Whoa! That one kept going. (Exits.)'
Joey	 So! You and Phoebe huh? How long have you been going out?'
Man	 Over a month.'
Joey	 Wow! Maybe uh, maybe you and I ought to get to know each other a little\nbetter.'
Man	 Sure, I\xc2\x92d like that.'
Joey	 So uh, what\xc2\x92s your name?'
Man	 (laughs) Its Jake.'
Joey	 Joey. (They shake hands.) Hey Jake, do you like the Knicks?'
Jake	 Yeah, big fan.'
Joey	 Me too! There\xc2\x92s a game on Tuesday do you wanna go?'
Jake	 Yeah that would be great! Let me make sure I\xc2\x92m not doing anything\nTuesday. (He bends over to open his bag, when he does so his pants slide down his butt\nrevealing a pink lace secret.)'
Monica	 Here! (She sets a bag down in front of him.)'
Chandler	 What\xc2\x92s this?'
Monica	 It\xc2\x92s your suitcase. We\xc2\x92re going to Las Vegas.'
Chandler	 Are you serious?! I mean like eloping?! No more stupid wedding stuff?!\nNo more these flowers or these flowers or these flowers\xc2\x97Think of the money we\xc2\x92ll\nsave!! (Monica just looks at him.) We\xc2\x92re not eloping. I love the flowers. Can our\nwedding be bigger please?'
Monica	 We\xc2\x92re going to Las Vegas to see your dad. It\xc2\x92s time you two\ntalked, and I want to get to know my father-in-law.'
Chandler	 Y\xc2\x92know we already went over this and I won!'
Monica	 No you didn\xc2\x92t. Oh and honey just so you know, now that you\xc2\x92re\nmarrying me, you don\xc2\x92t get to win anymore.'
Chandler	 Look forget it okay? I don\xc2\x92t want to go. I don\xc2\x92t want to see\nhim. I don\xc2\x92t wanna.'
Monica	 Chandler, look I-I know that your dad embarrassed you. I know\xc2\x85'
Chandler	 No-no all kids are embarrassed by their parents, you\xc2\x92d\nhave to come up with a whole new word for what I went through. When I was in High School,\nhe used to come to all of my swim meets dressed as a different Hollywood starlet.\nY\xc2\x92know it\xc2\x92s hard enough to be fourteen. You\xc2\x92re skinny. You\xc2\x92re wearing\nspeedoes\xc2\x97That your mom promised that you would grow into! And you look up into the\nstands and there\xc2\x92s your dad cheering you on dressed as Carmen Miranda. We was wearing\na headdress with real fruit that he will later hand out to your friends as a\nhealthy snack!'
Monica	 Hey, the point is that he was at everyone of your swim meets and he was\nthere cheering you on! Okay? That\xc2\x92s a, that\xc2\x92s a pretty great dad.'
Chandler	 He had sex with Mr. Girabaldi!'
Monica	 Who\xc2\x92s Mr. Girabaldi?'
Chandler	 Does it matter?!'
Monica	 Chandler, you\xc2\x92re not fourteen anymore. Okay? Maybe it\xc2\x92s time\nthat you let that stuff go. If your father\xc2\x92s not at your wedding\xc2\x85you\xc2\x92re\ngonna regret it for the rest of your life.'
Chandler	 Yeah o-okay, but I\xc2\x92m just doing this for you.'
Monica	 Yes!'
Chandler	 So I really never get to win anymore?'
Monica	 How much did ever really win before?'
Joey	 Pheebs!'
Phoebe	 Hey!'
Joey	 Listen, you know how uh, when you\xc2\x92re wearing pants and you lean\nforward I check out your underwear?'
Phoebe	 Yeah!'
Joey	 Well, when Jake did it I saw that\xc2\x85he was wearing women\xc2\x92s\nunderwear!'
Phoebe	 I know. They were mine.'
Joey	 Oh. (Laughs.) No! No wait, that\xc2\x92s weird!'
Phoebe	 No, it\xc2\x92s not! We were just goofing around and I dared him to try\nthem on.'
Joey	 That\xc2\x92s weird!'
Phoebe	 I\xc2\x92m wearing his briefs right now.'
Joey	 That\xc2\x92s\xc2\x85kinda hot.'
Phoebe	 I think so too. And that little flap? Great for holding my lipstick.'
Joey	 Yeah, I wouldn\xc2\x92t know about that.'
Phoebe	 And! Y\xc2\x92know what Jake says? That women\xc2\x92s underwear is actually\nmore comfortable. And he loves the way the silk feels against his skin.'
Joey	 Yeah well next thing you know, he\xc2\x92ll be telling you that your high\nheels are good for his posture!'
Phoebe	 There is nothing wrong with Jake! Okay? He is all man! I\xc2\x92m thinking\neven more than you.'
Joey	 Oh yeah, he looked like a real lumberjack in those pink laceys.'
Phoebe	 I\xc2\x92m just saying that only a man completely secure with his\nmasculinity could walk around in women\xc2\x92s underwear! I don\xc2\x92t think you could ever\ndo that.'
Joey	 Hey! I am secure with my masculinity.'
Phoebe	 Okay whatever.'
Joey	 You\xc2\x92ve seen my huge stack of porn right? (Phoebe nods.)'
Rachel	 God. I forgot how much I love driving. I have got to get my\nlicense renewed.'
Ross	 (shocked) You don\xc2\x92t have a valid driver\xc2\x92s\nlicense\xc2\x97Okay that is it! Pull over right now!'
Rachel	 Oh Ross you\xc2\x92re so tense! You just gotta relax okay? Just need to\nrelax all right? Just need to relax\xc2\x85 (She takes her hands off of the wheel.)'
Ross	 (grabbing the wheel) What-what are you doing?! Are you\xc2\x97Okay\nthat\xc2\x92s not funny! Just stop horsing around!'
Rachel	 I am not horsing around okay? I am Porsching around.'
Rachel	 Uh-oh. (She starts to pull over.)'
Ross	 Okay, stay calm. Nothing is going to happen to you, you are not in that\nmuch trouble.'
Rachel	 Really? You think so?'
Ross	 I was talking to myself! You\xc2\x92re going down!'
A Waiter in Drag	 (to Chandler and Monica) Has someone taken your order yet?'
Monica	 Uh oh yeah, she did. Uh, he did. (To Chandler) She? (To the waiter)\nI\xc2\x92m-I\xc2\x92m sorry I\xc2\x92m new. I don\xc2\x92t\xc2\x85'
Waiter in Drag	 (To Chandler) Hm-mmm?'
Chandler	 Yeah, I just ordered a beer! (Pounds the table.)'
Waiter in Drag	 You\xc2\x92re straight. I get it. (Walks away.)'
Monica	 I still say that if we had called your dad we coulda gotten better\nseats.'
Chandler	 No! No! I don\xc2\x92t want him to know we\xc2\x92re yet! I\xc2\x92m not\nsure I\xc2\x92m ready for that. And besides he\xc2\x92s not gonna be too happy to see me\neither.'
Monica	 Why not?!'
Chandler	 I don\xc2\x92t know if I\xc2\x92ve told you this, but he\xc2\x92s kinda\ntried to get in contact with me a lot over the last few years'
Monica	 What?!'
Chandler	 Yeah, he\xc2\x92s made phone calls, written letters, he even came to New\nYork, but I always said I was too busy to see him. Y\xc2\x92know it\xc2\x92s all very Cats\nin the Cradle\xc2\x97I don\xc2\x92t want to get into it. (The show starts.) Here we go.'
Helena	 Hello darlings.'
Chandler	 And there\xc2\x92s daddy!'

Rachel	 Okay. Switch places with me! Switch places with me! Come on! I\xc2\x92ll\ngo under, you go over!'
Ross	 Yeah, I\xc2\x92ll get right on that.'
Rachel	 Oh come on Ross!! (She tries to switch places with him and goes under\nhis leg.)'
Ross	 No Rach! Come on! No-no! Yeah, I\xc2\x92m sure we won\xc2\x92t get arrested\nfor this.'
Rachel	 (sexily) Hi officer, was I going a little too fast?'
Ross	 Oh my God.'
Policeman	 Can I see your license please?'
Rachel	 Oh yes, absolutely! Y\xc2\x92know, it\xc2\x92s weird uh, but I had a dream\nlast night where I was stopped by a policeman. And then he uh\xc2\x85well I probably\nshouldn\xc2\x92t tell you the rest.'
Policeman	 Your license?'
Rachel	 (handing it to him) Yes. Here you go Officer uh, Handsome.'
Policeman	 That\xc2\x92s Hanson.'
Rachel	 Oops sorry, my mistake.'
Ross	 Dear Lord!!'
Policeman	 Wow!'
Ross	 Here it comes.'
Policeman	 This is a great picture.'
Rachel	 Really?! You think so? Y\xc2\x92know, I had just rolled out of bed.'
Policeman	 Yeah? Well you look phenomenal.'
Ross	 Well she should, it was taken ten years ago!'
Rachel	 Y\xc2\x92know you\xc2\x92re-you\xc2\x92re probably wondering about the old\ndate on there.'
Policeman	 Yes I am.'
Rachel	 Yeah.'
Policeman	 You\xc2\x92re an Aquarius, huh?'
Rachel	 I bet you\xc2\x92re a Gemini. '

Policeman	 You\xc2\x92re not gonna speed anymore right?'
Rachel	 I won\xc2\x92t speed.'
Policeman	 And you promise you\xc2\x92ll get this taken care of right away?'
Rachel	 I promise.'
Policeman	 And in the meantime you better let him drive. Does he have a license?'
Rachel	 Yeah!'
Policeman	 Can he handle the stick?'
Rachel	 Oh well\xc2\x85'
Ross	 I can handle the stick!!'
Helena	 I feel pretty. Oh so pretty. I feel pretty and witty and\xc2\x85(She\nholds the mike out to the audience.)'
All	 Gay!'
Monica	 That can\xc2\x92t be your father.'
Chandler	 Believe me, I\xc2\x92ve been saying that for years. Oh my God!'
Monica	 What?'
Chandler	 That\xc2\x92s Mr. Girabaldi playing the piano.'
Helena	 (singing) For I\xc2\x92m loved by a pretty wonderful boy!\n(Applause.) Hello! And welcome to the show. I see some of our regulars in the audience.\nAnd a couple of irregulars. (He starts going into the audience.)'
Chandler	 He\xc2\x92s coming into the audience. He\xc2\x92s coming into the\naudience.'
Monica	 Relax! You\xc2\x92ll be fine. (Chandler exhales and turns off the table\nlight.) Oh much better. You\xc2\x92re invisible now.'
Helena	 (standing at a table and asking the guy sitting there) Where are you\nfrom?'
Guy	 Bakersfield.'
Helena	 I\xc2\x92m sorry? (Holds out the mike.)'
Guy	 Bakersfield!'
Helena	 No-no I heard! I\xc2\x92m just sorry.'
Chandler	 It can\xc2\x92t happen like this. Okay? I\xc2\x92ll meet you back at the\nhotel.'
Helena	 (to Chandler\xc2\x92s back) Oh look, a standing ovation already! So early\nin the show. Oh turn around honey; let me see your pretty face. (He slowly turns around.\nHelena recognizes him.)'
Monica	 Can we have our drinks please?! Waiter\xc2\x97Uh, tress!'
Joey	 Hey Pheebs! (He sits down next to her.)'
Phoebe	 Hey!'
Joey	 Check it out. (He turns around, pulls down his pants, and shows Phoebe\nthat he\xc2\x92s got panties on.) How much of a man am I?!'
Phoebe	 Wow! Nice! Manly and also kind of a slut.'
Joey	 Y\xc2\x92know, I\xc2\x92m beginning to see what Jake was talking about.'
Phoebe	 Uh-huh.'
Joey	 The silk? Feels really good!'
Phoebe	 Huh.'
Joey	 Yeah! And-and things aren\xc2\x92t as\xc2\x85smashed down as I thought they\nwere gonna be.'
Phoebe	 That\xc2\x92s great Joe!'
Joey	 Yeah! And you have so many more choices than you do with\nmen\xc2\x92s underwear!'
Phoebe	 Uh-huh.'
Joey	 Bikini, French cut, thong! And-and the fabrics! You\xc2\x92ve got cotton,\nsilk, lace! And y\xc2\x92know what I\xc2\x92ve always wondered about?'
Phoebe	 Hmm?'
Joey	 Pantyhose! Y\xc2\x92know? They way they start at your toe and go all the way\nup to here\xc2\x85 (He mimed that and stops when he realized he went to far.) I should go\ntake these off shouldn\xc2\x92t I?'
Phoebe	 I think it\xc2\x92s important that you do.'
Helena	 So what\xc2\x92s your name?'
Chandler	 (resigning himself to his fate) Chandler. (He quickly sits down.)'
Helena	 Chandler? What an unusual name! You must\xc2\x92ve had terribly fascinating\nparents.'
Chandler	 Oh, they\xc2\x92re a hoot.'
Helena	 (To Monica) And who is your friend?'
Monica	 I\xc2\x92m-I\xc2\x92m Monica.'
Helena	 Monica! Where are you from?'
Monica	 New York.'
Helena	 I\xc2\x92m not very fond of New York. Queens I like. (Noticing\nMonica\xc2\x92s ring.) Ooh, what is this sparkle something! (Shows the audience who\nwoos.) Honey! Huh?'
Chandler	 Actually Monica and I are engaged.'
Helena	 Really?! Congratulations. When\xc2\x92s the big day?'
Monica	 (looks at Chandler) In\xc2\x85in two weeks.'
Helena	 (disappointed) I see. Well, I wish you both a lifetime of\nhappiness. (To a bald guy.) So you\xc2\x92re bald?'
Chandler	 Wait! Wait! We\xc2\x92d really love it if you could be there.'
Helena	 We? (Looks at Monica who nods.)'
Chandler	 I know it would make me happy, ma\xc2\x92am.'
Helena	 Well I wouldn\xc2\x92t miss it for the world. Oh! I\xc2\x92m getting all\nmisty here! You\xc2\x92d think I was having my legs waxed or something. (Goes back on\nstage.)'
Monica	 (To Chandler) You okay?'
Chandler	 Yeah. Thanks for making me do this.'
Helena	 Before we go on with the show, I just want to say to the bride and groom\nhow lucky they are to have found each other. In every life, a little rain must fall.\nFortunately, in my life\xc2\x85 (Four guys wearing rubber boots, shorts, hats, and nothing\nelse carrying umbrellas run onto the stage.) (Singing) It\xc2\x92s raining men! '
Helena	 It\xc2\x92s raining men!'
Chandler	 (To Monica) When I was growing up I\xc2\x85played the one on the far\nleft.'
Rachel	 Remind me to introduce you to someone!'
Ross	 Who?'
Rachel	 Fourth gear!!'
Ross	 What?! What does he want?! I wasn\xc2\x92t doing anything!'
Rachel	 Well maybe he saw your hand slip briefly from the ten and two\no\xc2\x92clock position.'
Ross	 Maybe it\xc2\x92s uh Sergeant Sagittarius coming back to flirt some more!\n(They pull over.)'
Rachel	 It\xc2\x92s a different guy!'
Ross	 Good evening officer.'
Policeman	 Do you know how fast you were traveling back there?'
Ross	 Ah no. I don\xc2\x92t, but it could not have been more than sixty.'
Policeman	 You\xc2\x92re right. It was 37. (Rachel laughs.)'
Ross	 I mean you\xc2\x92re not gonna give me a-a ticket for driving too slow are\nya?'
Policeman	 That\xc2\x92s right.'
Ross	 Y\xc2\x92know of-officer I uh\xc2\x85I had the weirdest dream last night\xc2\x85'
Rachel	 Oh my God!'
Policeman	 Your license please.'
Ross	 (laughs) You don\xc2\x92t-you don\xc2\x92t want to hear about my dream\nOfficer\xc2\x85Pretty?'
Policeman	 It\xc2\x92s Petty. (He grabs Ross\xc2\x92s license.) I\xc2\x92ll be right\nback with your ticket. (Walks back to his car.)'
Rachel	 (pause) You have a son!'
Ross	 I know. I know.'

Phoebe	 Feel better?'
Joey	 Yeah! Much! Listen uh, not that I\xc2\x92m y\xc2\x92know insecure about my\nmanhood or anything y\xc2\x92know, but I think I need to hook up with a woman like right\nnow.'
Phoebe	 Yeah, I understand.'
Joey	 Yeah! Okay! (He notices a beautiful woman sitting behind the couch and\ngoes to talk to her.) Hey! Hi!'
Woman	 Hi!'
Joey	 Y\xc2\x92know, you look familiar. Do I know you from somewhere?'
Woman	 I don\xc2\x92t think so.'
Joey	 Oh! Maybe it\xc2\x92s because I\xc2\x92m on television. I\xc2\x92m an actor on Days\nof Our Lives.'
Woman	 Wow!'
Joey	 Yeah.'
Woman	 Really?!'
Joey	 Hm-mmm.'
Waitress	 (to the woman) $4.50 please.'
Joey	 Oh, let me get this. (He takes out his wallet, but the panties come with\nit. The woman and waitress are shocked.) (Realizing) (To the woman) These are for you.'
