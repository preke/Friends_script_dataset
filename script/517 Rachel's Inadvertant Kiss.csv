Rachel	 Good, you guys are all here!'
Ross	 Hey! What's up?"
Rachel	 Well, I have a job interview at Ralph Lauren tomorrow!'
All	 Congratulations! Ohh, that's great!"
Rachel	 I know!'
Joey	 Boy, that guy's underwear sucks!"
Rachel	 Wh-what?!'
Joey	 I got this pair marked excess, I gotta tell ya, there was no room for\nexcess anything in there.'
Rachel	 Anyway, I'm going to be the coordinator of the woman's collection, I'll\nwork right under the director, it's the perfect, perfect job for me!"
Phoebe	 Wow! Well, if you nail the interview, you'll get it!"
Rachel	 Yeah.'
Phoebe	 You wanna work on your interview skills?'
Rachel	 O-okay!'
Phoebe	 Okay! All right, let's start with the handshake. Hi."
Rachel	 Hi. '
Phoebe	 Very good handshake, good wrist action.'
Monica	 Let me try. (Gets up to join them.)'
Phoebe	 Okay. (They shake hands and she pulls away suddenly) Oh my God! What did\nI ever do to you?! (Rubbing her hand.)'
Monica	 Did I squeeze it too hard?'
Phoebe	 Let's just say, I'm glad I'm not Chandler."

Joey	 That's right Ross, I can see you in your new apartment! And you can see\nme! Same as yesterday, (To Monica) same as the day before."
Monica	 Is he doing his shark attack bit yet?'
Joey	 Nope. Op, wait! There he goes. '
Joey	 (waving) Very funny Ross! Very life-like and funny. Okay. (Notices that a\nwoman is waving back.) Oh no-no-no, I wasn't waving at you lady. (She just stares at him.)\n(Joey sees how beautiful she is.) Whoa, maybe I was! Hey, Monica, this totally hot girl in\nRoss's building is flirting with me."
Monica	 Get in there man! Flirt back, mix it up!'
Joey	 Yeah, I-I-I'm down with that. (He turns back to the woman.) Okay, here\ngoes. (Thinks.) How (Holds up his hand like an Indian) you (Points at her) a-doin'? (Does\na little twisting motion with both hands and ends up pointing at her, he then winks. She\nsmiles and waves again.) (To Monica) It worked! She's waving me over. (Towards the woman.)\nOkay, I-I-I'll be right over. Let's see, she's on the third floor\xc2\x85"
Monica	 (joining him) Wow! She is pretty, huh?'
Joey	 Tell me about it, huh? (Realizes that she can see Monica.) Oh no-no-no,\nI'm not with her, she's just Monica! (He pantomimes that out.) Ewwuck! (He pushes Monica\naway and makes a disgusted face.)"
Ross	 Hey Joey! Great stuff huh?'
Joey	 This is your place?'
Ross	 Of course it is. Yeah, come on in. Ooh-ooh, go by the window you can\npretend to be surfing. (He pretends he's surfing by the window.)"
Joey	 But I counted, you're not supposed to live here! Oh man! (Runs away.)"
Joey	 Ugh!!'
Monica	 What happened?'
Joey	 I ended up at Ross's place. Oh, I musta missed counted or something.\n(Looks out the window.) Damn! She's not there anymore. Oh, l-l-look, Ross is doing his\n'Watching TV' bit. (We see Ross sitting on the couch and flipping through the channels on\nhis remote.)"
Monica	 No Joey, I think he's just watchin' TV. "
Gary's Radio	 We've lost visual contact with the suspect."
Gary	 Okay, now I've really have to go!"
Phoebe	 But it's just so unfair that our date has to get cut short just 'cause\nsome guy shot at a store clerk."
Gary	 I know, but it's my job, sweethart!"
Phoebe	 Okay, then maybe I can come too!'
Gary's Radio	 Suspect has just emerged naked from the sewer."
Phoebe	 All right, you go. (They kiss.)'
Gary	 Bye-bye.'
Phoebe	 'Kay, bye!"
Phoebe	 Oh God!'
Monica	 What?'
Phoebe	 Oh I just miss him so much!'
Monica	 Wow! For just a week you guys are really close, huh?'
Phoebe	 Yeah, it's weird. I can't help it though he's so sweet, he's like this\nlittle puppy dog, y'know? But like a really tough one that shots bad guys. Ohh, I just love\nbeginning parts of relationships, y'know?! You just like can't keep your hands off each\nother."
Monica	 I know it is the best.'
Phoebe	 So-so how long did that last for you and Chandler?'
Monica	 What? It's still going on."
Phoebe	 Come on, seriously! When did it end?'
Monica	 I-I am serious, I mean, we're, we're all over each other all the time."
Phoebe	 Okay, you know where you are better than I do. I was just curious.'
Monica	 (Start annoying hyper-competitive mode now.) (Jumping up) What don't you\njust calm down Phoebe! All right?! Why don\xc2\x92t you just get all your facts before you\nrun around telling everybody that you're the only hot couple!!"
Phoebe	 (Under her breath) God, I woke the beast. Sorry. (To Monica) I was wrong\nobviously, I just\xc2\x97I misspoke. It's okay."
Monica	 Oh no, it is okay, I mean as long as you know that Chandler and I\nare also very hot and fiery, just as hot as you! I mean our flame, whew, is on fire!'
Chandler	 (entering) Hey Monica, here's your broom back."
Monica	 You are so cute. (She goes over and kisses him passionately.)'
Chandler	 Oh hey, how'd the interview go?"
Rachel	 Ugh, horrible! I did the stupidest, most embarrassing thing!'
Joey	 Did you tell the guy you wanted to have sex with his wife and then fall\nright out of your chair?'
Rachel	 No!'
Chandler	 So what happened?'
Rachel	 Ugh, it was horrible! And-and the interview part went so well, y\'know? I\neven made him laugh. He said something about a boat and I was like, "Well, yeah! If\nyou\'ve got enough life jackets!" (She starts laughing; Chandler and Joey are not\namused.) Trust me, it was actually, it was very funny. Anyway, so we were saying good-bye\nand ugh!'
Joey	 What happened?'
Rachel	 (We see a flashback as Rachel describes what happened.) All right, we\nwere shaking hands and he kinda leaned toward me\xc2\x85 Y'know maybe he was going to open\nthe door, but I totally miss read him and I uhhh\xc2\x85 (The flashback shows that she\nkissed him on the cheek.)"
Joey	 You kissed him?!'
Rachel	 Well, I didn't know what else to do!"
Chandler	 Well you coulda tried, not kissing him.'
Rachel	 Thanks Chandler.'
Monica	 (entering from the bathroom) Hey Rach, a guy from Ralph Lauren\ncalled, you got a second interview!'
Rachel	 I can't believe it! I got a second interview!"
Monica	 Yes!'
Joey	 I bet that kiss isn't looking like such a big mistake now, is it?"
Rachel	 What-what, wait a minute, you don't think that's why he wants me back?"
Joey	 Yeah! (Chandler makes a noise) No?'
Monica	 A kiss? What are you talking about?'
Rachel	 I accidentally kissed him in the interview, and now he wants me back\ny\'know of course, \'cause "Let\'s bring the girl back who kisses everybody!"'
Chandler	 Come on, Rach.'
Rachel	 Oh my God! What if he thinks I'm the kind of girl that-that would just\nsleep with him?"
Monica	 He probably wants you back because you're right for the job."
Rachel	 Maybe. I-I don't know\xc2\x97Oh God, how could I be so stupid?!"
Joey	 Oh Rachel look, don't say that, I think you just need a hug from Joey.\nCome on. Come on. (She hugs him and Joey looks out the window.) She's back! Hot girl's\nback!"
Rachel	 Ohh, well I'm not totally back yet, but thank you."
Joey	 No, in Ross's building! (He throws Rachel onto the chair and heads to the\nwindow.) She's back! She's back! (Pantomimes) Okay, wait there, I'll be over in a second.\n(He counts where she is again.) Got it! (Runs out and does a little hot over a chair.)"
Chandler	 I gotta check out this hot girl! (He heads to the window but realizes\nsomething, stops, turns and points at Monica.) There she is! (He dances over to her and\nkisses her.)'
Joey	 Damnit!! Did you move?!'
Ross	 Yes. I lived with you guys for a while and then I found this place. (Joey\njust stares at him) I'm Ross."
The Old Man	 Yes?'
Joey	 (Looking around) Uhh do you happen to have a hot girl in there?'
The Old Man	 No. I'm all alone."
Joey	 Yeah. Sorry about that. (He walks away and knocks on the next door which\nis answered by a little girl.) Oh, hey little girl. Uhh, is-is your mommy, or sister, or\nbabysitter by any chance a hot girl?'
The Little Girl	 Daddy!!'
Joey	 Later! (He runs away down the hall and hides behind a corner to a whole\nother corridor.) Oh man! (Walks down the hallway in desperation.) Hot girl! Hot girl!!'
Mr. Zelner	 Hi Rachel!'
Rachel	 Hi!'
Mr. Zelner	 Come on in.'
Mr. Zelner	 It's really nice to see you again."
Rachel	 Thank you.'
Mr. Zelner	 (Sees that she has some ink on her lip from her pen.) Oh Rachel,\nuhh\xc2\x85 (He points to his lip to get her to notice the ink on hers.)'
Rachel	 What?'
Mr. Zelner	 Just ah\xc2\x85 (He points again.)'
Rachel	 Excuse me?'
Mr. Zelner	 Here let me\xc2\x85 (He goes to wipe it off himself.)'
Rachel	 (stopping him) Wh-whoa! All right, okay-okay, I see, I see what's going\non here! Now listen, look-look, I'm sorry if I gave you the wrong impression, but I am not\nsome hussy who will just sleep around to get ahead! Now even though I (He tries to\ninterrupt and tell her about the ink), hey-hey-hey, even though I kissed you, that does\nnot give you the right to demand sex from me. I do not want, this job that\nbad. Good day, sir. (She storms out of his office.)"
Rachel	 (entering) Ugh, you will not believe what that sleaze-ball from Ralph\nLauren did too me!'
Rachel	 Okay-okay that-that's amazing. How did you know that?"
Ross	 You got ink on your lip.'
Rachel	 Oh. (Realizes.) Ohhhhhhhhh\xc2\x85.'
Chandler	 (To Gary) So what do you say, maybe sometime I hold your gun?'
Gary	 I don't know man, we're really not supposed to do that."
Chandler	 Oh, what can happen? I mean, would you\xc2\x85 (He gestures and spills\nsome of his coffee.)'
Gary	 Yeah, I'm gonna say no."
Monica	 Phoebe, do you want to go see a movie after dinner tonight?'
Phoebe	 Oh we can't, we already have plans."
Monica	 What are you doing?'
Phoebe	 Well, same thing we did all day, hang out at Gary's apartment. He is so\namazing, we never left the bedroom. But have fun at the movie."
Monica	 (That annoying competitiveness thing kicks in again, what the heck is\nthat with her and why must the writers show it every flippin' episode?!) Oh, we're not\nseeing a movie!"
Phoebe	 You're not? Then why did you ask us if we wanted to go?"
Monica	 Oh umm, that's because I just wanted to y'know walk in on me and\nChandler while we were, y'know, doing it all night. Will you excuse me for just a second?"
Phoebe	 Yeah!'
Monica	 Okay. (She gets up and walks over to Chandler.) Chandler? Can I see you\nfor a second?'
Chandler	 Uh, yeah.'
Monica	 Okay. (They walk away to get some privacy.) We have got to beat\nthem! {Here we go yet again.}'
Chandler	 Why?'
Monica	 'Cause, Gary and Phoebe think they're a hotter couple than we are!"
Chandler	 Ohh, so?'
Monica	 So! So we've got to go upstairs and have a lot of sex to prove them\nwrong!"
Chandler	 Monica, you have got to stop this competitive thing! Okay? It's\ncrazy. {Finally! The voice of reason.} I mean, just impress Gary and Phoebe we have to go\nupstairs and have sex over and over and I'm saying no to this, why? Get your coat."

Ross	 (to the woman checking her mail next to him) Hey!'
The Man	 (To Ross) Excuse me. (He puts up a flyer that has a sketch drawing of\nJoey and it reads, "Warning! Intruder! If you see this creep - call the cops!")\nYou should check this out, tell the other tenants. Apparently he\'s running around looking\nfor some kind of a hot girl.'
Ross	 (to the woman checking her mail) Who isn't? "
Ross	 I don't, I don't think we've meet. I-I'm Ross."
The Hot Girl	 I know. You're the guy who wouldn't chip in for the handyman."
Ross	 Nevermind! (Goes back to his mailbox.)'
The Hot Girl	 No, I-I actually thought it was unfair the way everyone reacted. I\nmean you had just moved in.'
Ross	 I had just moved in. Thank you! Listen umm\xc2\x85'
The Hot Girl	 Jen.'
Ross	 Jen, I know this may sound a little\xc2\x85(makes some kind of crazy noise)\nBut uh, would you maybe wanna grab a cup of coffee sometime, or\xc2\x85'
Jen	 Sure! That would be nice.'
Ross	 Umm?'
Jen	 Oh! My number is on there. (Hands him a business card.) Give me a call.'
Ross	 I will give you a call.'
Jen	 I'll see you later. (Starts to walk away.)"
Ross	 Okay!'
Jen	 I forgot my paper. (Ross quickly hides the card in his mouth.)'
Chandler	 That was amazing!'
Monica	 Phoebe and Gary are so gonna hear about this at dinner.'
Chandler	 That was amazing.'
Monica	 We are the hottest! Huh? No one is hotter than we are! You're the\nbest."
Chandler	 No, you're the best."
Monica	 No, you're the best."
Chandler	 No, you're the best."
Monica	 I am the best.'
Joey	 (entering) Hey guys! (Sees their state of undress) What 'cha been doin'?\n(Has a silly grin.)"
Monica	 (looking out the window) Hey Joey! Isn't that the girl that waved at you\nthe other day?"
Joey	 I don't know. But I can see through your sheet. (He looks out the window.)\nYeah, yeah, that's her. But y'know what? Doesn't matter, I'm never gonna get to meet her\nanyway."
Monica	 Why?'
Joey	 Because it's impossible to find her apartment! She lives in some like of\nhot girl parallel universe, or something."
Monica	 What are you talking about? (Pointing out the window.) She obviously\nlives on the second floor, seventh apartment from the left!'
Joey	 No. No. No. She lives on the third floor, eighth apartment\nfrom the left.'
Monica	 No, those first two windows, (Points) that's the lobby. And y'know the\nother one over there, that's the stairway. You've been counting wrong."
Joey	 I did not know that! Thank you Monica. (Starts to leave) I can't\nbelieve I almost lost another girl because of counting."
Ross	 So uhh, you ready?'
Jen	 Sure, I'll just get my coat. (There's a knock on the door.) Could you get\nthat?"
Ross	 Sure. (He opens the door to Joey. Needless to say, Joey's stunned.)\nJoey\xc2\x85"
Joey	 Dahhhhh!! (Ross has a puzzled look on his face.) No! Noooo!! (Storms off.)'
Rachel	 Ah, first, I-I would like to say thank you for agreeing to see me again.'
Mr. Zelner	 That's quite all right, but I feel obligated to tell you that this\nmeeting is being videotaped."
Rachel	 (looks around for the camera) Okay. Umm, well, first I would like to\nstart by apologizing for kissing you and uh, for yelling at you.'
Mr. Zelner	 Fair enough.'
Rachel	 Now you're probably going to hire one of the people who did not ah, (She\nputs her hands on his desk blotter and he moves it. Rachel then doesn't know where to put\nher hands.) who did, who did not umm, yell at you and storm out, and I think that's a big\nmistake and here's why. I made a huge fool of myself and I came back, that shows courage.\nWhen I thought you wanted sex in exchange for this job, I said no. That shows integrity.\nAnd, I was not afraid to stand up for myself and that shows courage. (Suddenly realizes\nthat she said courage twice.) Okay umm, now I know I already said courage, but y'know you\ngotta have courage. And umm, and finally when I thought you were making sexual advances in\nthe workplace, I said no and I was not litigious. {By the way, litigious means to want to\nlitigate and litigate is to make a lawsuit against.\xc2\xa0 So she didn't want to sue him.\n\xc2\xa0 Don't worry, I had to look it up too.} So there you go, you got, you got (counts\nthem off with her fingers) courage, you got integrity, you got (Pause) courage again, and\nnot litigious. Look Mr\xc2\x85"
Mr. Zelner	 Zelner.'
Rachel	 Zelner! Right! I knew that! I really, really want this job and I think,\nI think I would be really good at it.'
Mr. Zelner	 Y'know what? I may regret this but uh, I'm going to give you a shot."
Rachel	 (gasps) Oh! You are?'
Mr. Zelner	 Um-hmm.'
Rachel	 Really? Oh thank you! Oh\xc2\x85 Oh, would it be completely inappropriate\nto give you a hug?'
Mr. Zelner	 Yes!'
Rachel	 Okay, well then how about a handshake? (She goes to shake his hand but\nmisses and touches his groin.) Oh God I'm sorry! Oh God, I'm sorry! I did not mean to\ntouch that\xc2\x97I mean you there. There. Uhh, okay, so thank-thank you, I'm going\nto leave now thank you very much uh-huh, thank you so\xc2\x97Hey! I'll see you Monday!\n(Exits.)"
Phoebe	 You tired Chandler?'
Monica	 You better believe he's tired, after the day we had! If you know what I\nmean. You know what I mean?"
Chandler	 Honey, the tortilla chips know what you mean.'
Gary	 So uh Chandler, you like that badge I got you?'
Chandler	 Oh yeah, it's so cool. (He opens his coat and has it pinned to the\nlining.) Now I gotta go, Officer Bing has gotta, 10-100. (Pause, softly) That's pee-pee.\n(Heads for the bathroom.)"
Monica	 Phoebe, you have a, a twig in your hair.'
Phoebe	 Ohh, (laughs) umm, we kinda took a little detour on the way over here.'
Gary	 Yeah, we took a little stroll in the park and no one was around, so\xc2\x85'
Monica	 You didn't!"
Phoebe	 We did! We violated Section 12 Paragraph 7 of the criminal code!'
Monica	 The park huh? A public place.'
Gary	 Uh-huh.'
Monica	 I hear ya. Excuse me for just a second! (Gets up and heads for the\nbathroom as that annoying Gotta-win-at-all-costs-super-competitive thing kicks in again.)'
Monica	 Hi Chandler.'
Chandler	 Monica! This is the Men's room! (Pause) Isn't it?"
Monica	 Yes it is. You see I've always found the men's bathroom very sexual.\nHaven't you?"
Chandler	 No. And if I did, I don't think we'd be going out. Monica, this is\ngetting ridiculous!"
Monica	 Come on, we can't let them win!"
Chandler	 Ugh, we have already proved that we are hot! Okay? So why-why are you\ngetting so obsessed about this thing?!'
Monica	 Because Phoebe and Gary are in\nthat-can't-keep-their-hands-off-each-other-doing-it-in-the-park phase!"
Chandler	 (gasps) So?'
Monica	 I feel really sad that we're not\xc2\x85really there anymore."
Chandler	 Oh wow! Is that what this all have been about?'
Monica	 Wasn't it a lot more exciting when we were y'know all over each other\nall the time?"
Chandler	 Yeah that was great. That was really great! But to tell you the truth,\nI'm more excited about where we are right now."
Monica	 Really?'
Chandler	 Yeah! I've never been in a relationship that's lasted this long\nbefore. Y'know to get past the beginning and still be around each other all the time, I\nthink that's pretty incredible. And the fact that this is happening all with you, yeah I\nthink that's pretty exciting. (Kisses her.)"
Monica	 That is so sweet. I know that I was acting a little crazy but umm, I\nfeel the same way.'
Chandler	 Yeah?'
Monica	 Yeah. (They hug.)'
Chandler	 Y'know what I just realized? You just freaked out about our\nrelationship."
Monica	 Did not.'
Chandler	 Yes you did! Admit it! You freaked out!'
Monica	 Okay, I freaked out a little.'
Chandler	 Little?! You freaked out big time! Okay? And I fixed it! We have\nswitched places! I am the relationship and king and you are the crazy, irrational\nscrew up! (Does a dance of joy.) (Monica glares at him.) And now we're back."

Rachel	 (laughs) I cannot believe Ross is buying this!'
Monica	 Thank God! I can't watch him anymore!"
Chandler	 (entering) You guys ready fore the movies?'
Rachel	 Yeah! Oh by the way, thank you for loaning us Pamela and Yasmine. '
Ross	 (from his apartment) Man! They cannot get enough! (Makes like he's a robot\nand waves at the cutouts.)"
