Ross	 (picking up the slip of paper) Hello! What's this? Oh right its that\ngirl's phone number. (Rachel ignores him) Yeah-yeah, there it is, just a phone number a\nreally hot girl gave me. (He holds it so that Rachel can see it, she continues to ignore\nhim) It's no big deal, I mean it is her home phone number, but...(Rachel still ignores\nhim) Whoa! (Throws it in her lap) Whoa-whoops, I almost lost this baby! Yeah, the lovely\nAmanda gives me her number and I-I go and drop it. (He waves it in front of Rachel's face.\nThen suddenly Phoebe has to sneeze and Rachel quickly grabs the slip of paper and gives it\nto Phoebe for her to sneeze into.)"
Phoebe	 Thank you.'

Gunther	 Rachel?'
Rachel	 Yeah?'
Gunther	 When's your birthday?"
Rachel	 May fifth, why?'
Gunther	 Oh, I-I'm just making a list of people's birthdays."
Ross	 Oh, mine's December..."
Gunther	 Yeah, whatever. (Walks away)'
Chandler	 Ohh, she's pretty. Pretty ahh, pretty girl, the pretty--she's pretty."
Monica	 Just go up to her and ask her out. (Chandler laughs) Oh, what's the\nworst thing that could happen?"
Chandler	 I could die.'
Ross	 Yeah, it's-it's tough being single. That's why I'm so glad I found Amanda."
Rachel	 Ross, you guys went out once. You took your kids to Chucky Cheese,\nand you didn't even kiss her."
Chandler	 I tell people secrets. It makes them like me.'
Phoebe	 (entering) Oh.'
Chandler	 Hey! (Phoebe sneezes)'
Monica	 Phoebe! You're sick, you shouldn't play. You should just go home, get in\nbed, and stay there."
Phoebe	 (in a nasally voice, from her cold) But I'm unemployed, my music is all\nI really have now. Well music, and making my own shoes. (She puts her shoe on the table,\nand it's horribly decorated) Pretty, huh? (Sneezes)"
Chandler	 All right, I'm gonna do it! I'm gonna get shot down. Any advice?"
Monica	 Just be yourself. But, not too much.'
Chandler	 (gets up) (softly) Wish me luck.'
Ross	 (loudly) Good luck!'
Chandler	 Wish it! (To the woman, Kathy, he likes) Hi. Hi, I-I was just sitting\nover there, and uhh, Chandler. My name is Chandler. Did I say that?'
Kathy	 No, you didn't. Hi, I'm Kathy."
Chandler	 Uh Kathy, with K or a C?'
Kathy	 With a K.'
Chandler	 Oh-oh-hey!'
Kathy	 Wow! You are really good at this.'
Chandler	 Hey, come on, give me a break, I'm out on a limb here."
Kathy	 I'm sorry, you're right, I apologize, but I should tell you that I'm\nwaiting for a date. (Joey enters) Oh, and there he is now."
Joey	 Hey!'
Chandler	 Hey! Hey, hey-hey, hey. (Joey kisses Kathy.)'
Joey	 Hey, I see you guys already met, huh?'
Chandler	 Yes-yes, I was just trying to figure out a way to uh, demonstrate how\nI could get my exceptionally large feet into my even bigger mouth.'
Joey	 Didn't I tell ya? Always showin' off."
Phoebe	 Before I start, I just wanna say that umm, I have a cold, so if I sneeze\nin the middle of song, it's not on purpose. Oh, except the last verse of Pepper People.\n(Starts to sing) Smelly cat, smelly cat. What are they feeding you? (Stops\nsinging) This chick sounds good. (Singing) Smelly cat, smelly--(stops singing)\nHey Gunther, be a good little boy and bring me a whiskey."
Chandler	 (sees Kathy is up watching TV) Hi!'
Kathy	 Hi.'
Chandler	 Jeez, at 2
Kathy	 I'm sorry, it's just this Ernie Cofax thing on in a few minutes I wanted\nto watch."
Chandler	 Oh my God! That's why I got up too!"
Kathy	 You're kidding! Oh, I love him."
Chandler	 Hey, listen, I'm sorry about this afternoon, y'know, if I would've\nknown you guys were... I never would've..."
Kathy	 Oh please!'
Chandler	 So ah, Joey tells me you two met in acting class.'
Kathy	 Yeah, they teamed us up as partners. Joey picked three scenes for us to\ndo; all of them had us making out.'
Chandler	 That's a good thing actually, because ah, he used to have me rehearse\nwith him."
Kathy	 (laughs) Oh-oh-oh-oh!'
Chandler	 Is it on?'
Kathy	 No, but this wonder broom is amazing!'
Chandler	 Hey! (Runs over and gets his wonder broom)'
Kathy	 Oh my God!'
Chandler	 Oh! It's on! It's on!"
Chandler	 There we go little fella.'
Kathy	 (laughs) What about the duck?'
Chandler	 Well the duck can swim.'
Kathy	 Oh, jeez. (Hits him)'
Phoebe	 (singing, drunk) My sticky shoes, my sticky-sticky shoes, why do you\nstick on me, ba-a-by! Thanks for the lights honey. '
All	 Way to go, Phoebe!'
Monica	 That cold makes you sound so great.'
Phoebe	 It's fun, God I love how sexy I am. (Coughs really loudly.)"
Joey	 Oh, Kath, we should get going. We're going to by hamsters."
All	 Ooh, that's great, I love those little guys."
Kathy	 No, no, it's not like that. I, I work for a medical researcher."
Rachel	 Well, have fun!'
Kathy	 Okay.'
Phoebe	 Well, I think it's great that the medical community is finally trying to\nhelp sick hamsters."
Monica	 Y'know what, I like Kathy."
Chandler	 Oh yeah, me too, she's so cool and pretty."
Rachel	 Yeah, she's..."
Chandler	 She's smart and funny, y'know? We were up all last night talking, she\nsaid the funniest thing about--what? "
Rachel	 You love her.'
Chandler	 No, I don't."
Phoebe	 Yes, you do. Chandler loves Kathy.'
Ross	 Come on, Pheebs lay off him.'
Chandler	 Thank you, Ross.'
Ross	 Yeah, he's a little sensitive right now, `cause he's so in love."
Chandler	 All right.'
All	 Ohh!'
Chandler	 All right.'
Monica	 (turning around and doing that, "I\'m making out with someone,"\nthing with her hands) Ooh, umm, oh Kathy! Kathy, I love you! Oh! (She turns around and\nsees Gunther staring at her and stops suddenly.)'
Phoebe	 So, I need to write some depressing stuff to go along with my new floozy\nvoice, but nothing that sad has ever really happened to me.'
Monica	 Oh umm, how about your mom dying, or having to live on the streets when\nyou were 14?'
Phoebe	 Uh-huh. Oh, yeah, I could write about the time my hair did that\n"Woo-hoo" thing.'
Ross	 (entering) Hey!'
Monica	 Hey!'
Phoebe	 Hey.'
Ross	 (loudly) So I'm going over to Amanda's tonight!"
Monica	 Rachel's not here."
Ross	 Oh.'
Monica	 How's it going with her?"
Ross	 Great, actually. I\'m thinking tonight, maybe the night. Yeah, I mean ah,\nthe kids are gonna play together and then when they\'re asleep, I\'m thinking Amanda and I\nbreak open a bottle of wine, and do a little "playing" ourselves.'
Rachel	 (entering, with a guy) Hi guys! This is Josh. Josh, these are my\nfriends, and that's Ross."
Monica	 Hi, Josh.'
Phoebe	 Hi.'
Josh	 Dudes.'
Monica	 So, did you play in college? (She points to his NYU Soccer (football for\nthe rest of the world) sweatshirt he's wearing.)"
Josh	 Oh, I still do. Next year, I hope to make varsity though.'
Rachel	 Ross, didn't you ah, play soccer in High School? Oh no wait, that's\nright. You just organized their game schedules on your Commodore 64."
Josh	 Well, it's getting late, I've got to get to the game, so I'm gonna...\nhead."
Rachel	 Okay. (He starts to leave, and Rachel grabs him and gives him a\npassionate kiss.) I'll miss you."
Josh	 Dope! (exits)'
Phoebe	 Wow, cute one!'
Monica	 Very!'
Rachel	 I know, isn't he great? It's so nice to finally be in a fun\nrelationship, y'know? There's nothing boring about him, and ah, I bet he's never set foot\nin a museum."
Ross	 Well maybe he'll get to go soon, like on a class trip or something."
Rachel	 Y'know what else is really great about him, oh, what is the word for the\nadult that doesn't have dinosaur toys in their bedroom?"
Ross	 Oh! (He bangs his fists together.)'
Rachel	 What was that?'
Ross	 Monica knows.'
Monica	 It's this dumb thing that Ross made up `cause he was trying to fool our\nparents. It's a way of giving the finger, without actually having to give it. I remember I\ncried the night you made it up, `cause it was the first time that I realized that I was\nactually cooler than my older brother."
Ross	 Well, I'm gonna go get ready, (Gives Monica the fist thing.) for my date\ntonight, so ah, I'll just_ head."
Phoebe	 Yeah, I should go to, `cause I'm playing in one hour. Hey, (clears her\nvoice and in her normal voice) you guys should come hear me, ooh hear me. Ooh, (tries to\nsing) My sticky shoes--eww! Eww! I lost my sexy phlegm!"
Amanda	 (opening the door) Hi!'
Ross	 Hi!'
Amanda	 Hi Ben!'
Ross	 Wow! You-you look great!'
Amanda	 Thanks!'
Ross	 (she lets him in) Okay! (to her son) Hey Tommy.'
Amanda	 I am so glad that you could come over tonight.'
Ross	 Oh no-no-no, it's my pleasure."
Amanda	 Okay, well, my cell phone number is right here on the counter, please\nhelp yourself to anything in the fridge.'
Ross	 What?'
Amanda	 I appreciate this soo much, I've been trying to go out with this guy for\nlike a month."
Ross	 I-I-I...'
Amanda	 (noticing the bottle of wine he has) Oh, I don't mean to be a square,\nbut I'd really appreciate it if you wait and drink your wine after the kids are asleep? Oh\nuh, thanks for this, I hope I can do the same for you sometime. (She leaves)"
Ross	 Who wants to make some long distance calls?'
Chandler	 Kathy! Kathy! Hi!! Kathy! Kathy! (She doesn't hear him and keeps\nrunning, Chandler starts chasing her as the theme to The Mod Squad starts to\nplay. First, a car almost hits him and then gets mustard splashed on him as he runs by a\nhot dog vendor.) Kathy! (He keeps running and gets tangled up in the leashes of five dogs,\nin desperation he throws his paper.) Fetch! Fetch it! (He frees himself and resumes the\nchase) Kathy! Kathy! Kathy! (He now trips and falls into a pile of garbage, he tries to\nget up and scream her name again but he has a piece of spinach in his mouth. He gets out\nof the garbage and starts crossing the street by running over the hoods of a couple of\ncabs.) Kathy! (He jumps in front of her and out of breath he says) Kathy."
Kathy	 Hey, Chandler! What are you doing here?'
Chandler	 Oh, I just wanted to say, "Hey!"'
Kathy	 Hey!'
Chandler	 Okay. (He walks away disgusted with himself.)'

Monica	 Oh come on! You're making it sound worse than it actually was."
Ross	 Her date tipped me ten dollars. (Monica laughs)'
Ross	 Pheebs, what are you doing?'
Phoebe	 Okay, I wanna be sexy again so I'm trying to catch a cold. It should be\neasy, supposedly they're pretty common."
Monica	 Phoebe, you'll catch pneumonia."
Chandler	 (entering) Okay. You were right. I'm in love with Joey's girlfriend."
Phoebe	 What?!'
Ross	 Are you serious?'
Phoebe	 Well, how-how-how is that possible? You barely know her!'
Chandler	 I don't know. I can't--I just, I can't get her out of my head. Y'know?\nI mean, I'm a very bad person. I'm a very, very bad person. I'm a horrible person. (he\nwaits for a reaction, when he doesn't get one) No you're not Chandler! We still love you\nChandler!"
Monica	 (sneezes) Oh gosh, Phoebe, I think I caught your cold.'
Phoebe	 You mean you stole it! (Monica sneezes again) Don't cover your mouth\nwhen you do that!"
Joey	 Hey.'
Kathy	 (to Chandler) We were just talking about you.'
Chandler	 Really?!'
Joey	 Yeah-yeah, I told her about the time you got drunk and fell asleep with\nyour head in the toilet.'
Chandler	 (laughs) Right in there!'
Chandler	 99...100! Ready or not, here I come! (He opens his eyes and sees that\nthe chick and the duck are still sitting in front of him) All right, let's go over the\nconcept one more time."
Joey	 (entering) Hey!'
Chandler	 Hey!'
Joey	 Hey guys. (to Chandler) Listen uh, you wanna get some dinner with me and\nKathy tonight?'
Chandler	 Ohh, umm, y'know what, I already ate."
Joey	 It's 4
Chandler	 Y'know I had a big meal on Monday, y'know. So that's just gonna get me\nstraight through the week."
Joey	 Okay, I see what's going on here."
Chandler	 You-you do?'
Joey	 Yeah! You don't like Kathy."
Chandler	 You got me.'
Joey	 Yeah, you've been avoiding her ever since we started going out. Look, I\nmade an effort to like Janice, now I think it's your turn to make an\neffort to like Kathy by going out to dinner with us. Right?"
Chandler	 Yeah. Right.'
Joey	 Good, and hey! My treat. (He turns to go into his bedroom then stops.) But\nthat's only because you're not eating anything, right?"
Chandler	 Okay.'
Monica	 (lying on the couch suffering from her cold) Ross isn't here."
Rachel	 Oh. (She tries to walk away from Josh, by he keeps holding her) Stop it!'
Josh	 So I'll see you at the party? Beer's beer man, 24, 7!!"
Rachel	 Yeah! (Monica gives a sarcastic thumbs up) (Josh leaves) I am soo gonna\nmarry that guy. (looking in her wallet) Ohhh!'
Monica	 What?'
Rachel	 I think he's stealing from me."
Monica	 Why?'
Rachel	 Because he's stealing from me!"
Phoebe	 (entering) Hi! It's me. And soup. (to Rachel) Hey, I just saw Josh, he\nlooks so yummy in your leather jacket."
Rachel	 Ughh! (Storms out after him)'
Phoebe	 (to Monica) Here, now I don't eat chicken, so it's just noodle soup. And\nthere's no chicken in the broth either, so it's really just... noodle water. "
Monica	 Thank you so much Phoebe.'
Phoebe	 (picking up Monica's used Kleenex and putting some in her pocket.) Sure."
Monica	 What are you doing with those?!'
Phoebe	 But, I need your germs! I want my cold back! I miss my sexy voice.'
Monica	 Sorry, Phoebe.'
Phoebe	 It's okay. How's the soup?"
Monica	 Umm. (nodding her head, "Good.")'
Monica	 Ohhhh!! Gross!!'
Kathy	 Ohh, God, guys, check it out, you can see that girl's underwear!"
Joey	 Is she great or what?'
Kathy	 (to Chandler) So? Huh? What do you think?'
Chandler	 Ohh, she's-she's not really my type."
Kathy	 Not your type?! She's gorgeous!"
Chandler	 Y'know what I think it is? It's the fishnet stockings. Y'know?\nWhenever I see a girl in fishnet stockings it reminds me of my father in fishnet\nstockings."
Kathy	 Okay. Understanding a little more why you're single. Ohh! Y'know, I have\na friend you would like, she's really pretty. And then we could double date!"
Chandler	 Uhh, no-no thanks.'
Kathy	 Okay, I've got some ugly friends, and they're all available too."
Chandler	 Listen, I-I'm gonna grab a beer. (Leaves)"
Joey	 (to Kathy) I'll be right back. (to Chandler) What was that?"
Chandler	 What?'
Joey	 Kathy was being really nice and you just walked away. I thought we had a\ndeal.'
Chandler	 Hey, look, what do you want from me?'
Joey	 I want you to like her! But if that's too damned difficult for you, then\nthe least you can do is pretend."
Chandler	 I am pretending.'
Joey	 Well then, do it better!'
Chandler	 Okay, what do you saw I go over there and say how much I like her?\n(Joey gives him a thumbs up) No-no it'll be good, I can tell her much I've been thinking\nabout her. That I haven't stopped thinking about her since the moment I met her. That I'm\nso fantastically, over-the-top, wanna-slit-my-own-throat in love with her, that for every\nminute of every hour of every day I can't believe my own damn bad luck that you met her\nfirst!!"
Joey	 Well, that's pretty good. But you might wanna tone it down a little."
Ross	 (entering) Hey! So, uhh, Amanda just-just dropped me off. Yeah, that's one\nof the things I love about her, she's...uh, she's old enough to drive. (to Monica) So uhh,\nI guess you're not going to mom and dad's tonight?"
Monica	 No, sorry.'
Rachel	 Well where's Amanda?"
Monica	 Hey Rach, could you get me some cough drops?'
Rachel	 I mean y'know, I'm thinking. You could bring her, and you guys could go\nup to your old room, and not make out."
Monica	 Ross, cough drops, please?'
Ross	 At least I know she's not going out with me to get into R rated movies."
Rachel	 Why don't you just marry her? Oh no, wait a minute you can't, I'm sorry\nI forgot, she's not a lesbian."
Ross	 You see Amanda and I have a very special...'
Monica	 (interrupting) You have nothing! You're not even going out! You're her\nbaby sitter! You have a 12-year-old girl's job!"
Rachel	 (laughing) Ohh, that is soo sad.'
Monica	 And what are you laughing at, Miss\n`My-keg-sucking-boyfriend-is-stealing-from-me!'"
Rachel	 Hey, so he stole a couple bucks from me! At least he bought me something\nwith it! (Shows her, her ring)'
Monica	 That's mine!! Now, would you both please start acting like adults? And\nget me my cough drops!"
Ross	 Fine.'
Rachel	 Sorry.'
Ross	 Here. (Hands her, her cough drops) (to Rachel) At least I made ten bucks\nin my relationship.'
Rachel	 Y'know..."
Phoebe	 (singing) Platting goats are platting. Platting down the street.\nPlatting goats are platting, leaving little treats. (to Gunther) Does it even work\nwithout my sexy voice?'
Gunther	 I like it. (sneezes)'
Phoebe	 Gunther, kiss me.'
Gunther	 What?'
Joey	 (opening the door wearing nothing but a sock, and holding a dart board\nover the `Little General.') Hey! (Chandler turns down the TV) Now, we're not actually\ngonna be sleeping in her, but do you mind?"
Chandler	 Can I sleep on your couch?'

Phoebe	 (singing) And I'm still waiting for my paper mache man. Thank\nyou my babies."
Gunther	 Rachel?'
Rachel	 Yeah.'
Gunther	 I don't know if you heard about what happened between me and Phoebe the\nother day_"
Rachel	 No!'
Gunther	 Well, we kissed. I-I-I didn't initiate the kiss, but-but I also didn't\nstop it, and I've been feeling guilty."
Rachel	 (confused) Okay.'
Gunther	 So umm, are we cool?'
Rachel	 (really confused) Okay.'
Gunther	 I knew you'd understand."
