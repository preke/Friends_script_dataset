Phoebe	 Hey!'
Chandler	 Hey! Wow, it is true what they say, pregnant bellies look like\na drum.'
Phoebe	 (not amused) Ha-ha. (She sits down on the couch.) No, it\xc2\x92s just\nI\xc2\x92m so pregnant that I\xc2\x97my guitar doesn\xc2\x92t fit anymore. So I thought\n\xc2\x91til I\xc2\x92m not, I\xc2\x92m just gonna play all my songs on this drum. It sounds really\ncool!'
Chandler	 All right.'
Phoebe	 Listen. Listen. (She starts to play and sing.) Smelly cat, smelly\ncat, what are they feeding you? '
Joey	 Wow, Pheebs! That sounds great!'
Phoebe	 I know! I know, and I\xc2\x92ve only been playing for like an hour!'
Alice	 (entering) Phoebe! Phoebe! Hi! Hi!'
Phoebe	 Hey! What are you doing here?'
Alice	 Umm, actually, I came down to ask you a big favour.'
Phoebe	 Oh, well, don\xc2\x92t tell me you want to keep more of your stuff in my\nuterus.'
Alice	 (laughs) No. No. No. (Sits down.) Okay, now, see, I wanna name the girl\nbaby Leslie, and Frank wants to name one of the boy babies Frank JR. JR. '
Chandler	 Wouldn\xc2\x92t that be Frank the III?'
Alice	 Don\xc2\x92t get me started. (To Phoebe) Anyway, umm, since there are three\nbabies and umm, we both got to put our names in, we would be truly honoured if you named\nthe other boy baby.'
Phoebe	 Wow! That\xc2\x92s so great! Oh! Oh! Cougar.'
Alice	 You think about it. (Leaves)'

Emily	 I left a bra drying on the shower rod, you don\xc2\x92t think your son will\nthink it\xc2\x92s yours and be horribly traumatised? '
Ross	 Hey, if mommy can have a wife, daddy can have a bra.'
Emily	 (checks the clock) Ohh, it\xc2\x92s time to go.'
Ross	 Oh, no-no-no, see, that-that clock\xc2\x92s a little fast, uh, we have 17\nminutes. Huh, what can we do in 17 minutes? Twice?'
Emily	 Well that\xc2\x92s ambitious.'
Ross	 Hey, uh, you can ignore that.'
Emily	 That\xc2\x92s Carol with your son!'
Ross	 Uhh, believe me when he\xc2\x92s older, he\xc2\x92ll understand.'
Carol	 (knocking on the door) Ross!'
Ross	 I\xc2\x92ll be right there. (He goes over and opens the door to Carol,\nSusan, and Ben.) (To Ben.) Hello! (To Carol.) Hello! (To Susan.) Hey. Uhh, Emily, this is\nCarol and Susan.'
Susan	 Hey, it\xc2\x92s so nice to finally meet you!'
Emily	 Me too!'
Carol	 Ohh, y\xc2\x92know, Susan\xc2\x92s gonna be shooting a commercial in London\nnext week.'
Susan	 Oh yeah, I\xc2\x92m so excited, I\xc2\x92ve never been there.'
Emily	 Oh, well, I\xc2\x92ll show you around.'
Susan	 That would be great! Also, uh, I was hoping to catch a show so if you can\nmake any suggestions\xc2\x85'
Emily	 Oh, there\xc2\x92s tonnes of terrific stuff\xc2\x97I\xc2\x92ll go with you!'
Susan	 Ahh!'
Ross	 Look at you two, bonding, making us late for the airport so\xc2\x85'
Emily	 Are you all right?'
Susan	 Oh, he\xc2\x92s fine. He\xc2\x92s fine. It\xc2\x92s just that us getting along\nis difficult for him, because he doesn\xc2\x92t like me.'
Ross	 Oh come on! That\xc2\x92s-that\xc2\x92s\xc2\x85 true.'
Phoebe	 Hi!'
Joey	 Hey!'
Chandler	 Hey! Do we have a baby name yet?'
Phoebe	 Ugh! No! This is so hard! I went through this whole book (Holds up a\nbook) and found nothing! I want a name that\xc2\x92s really like, y\xc2\x92know strong and\nconfident, y\xc2\x92know? Like-like Exxon. '
Chandler	 Well, it certainly worked for that Valdez kid.'
Joey	 Ooh-ooh, Pheebs, you want a strong name? How about, The Hulk?'
Phoebe	 No, I\xc2\x92m-I\xc2\x92m not sure about Hulk, but I like the idea of a name\nstarting with "The."'
Joey	 Oh, want a good name, go with Joey. Joey\xc2\x92s your pal. Joey\xc2\x92s your\nbuddy. "Where is everybody?" "Well, they\xc2\x92re hanging out with\nJoey."'
Chandler	 Hey, y\xc2\x92know what, if you\xc2\x92re gonna do that, if you\xc2\x92re\ngonna name him Joey, you should name him Chandler. (Phoebe doesn\xc2\x92t think so.) Oh,\ncome on! Chandler\xc2\x92s funny, sophisticated, and he\xc2\x92s very loveable, once you get\nto know him.'
Joey	 Oh well, hey, Joey\xc2\x92s loveable too! But the thing about Joey is, if\nyou need him, he\xc2\x92ll be there.'
Chandler	 Well, Chandler will be there for you too. I mean, well, he might be a\nlittle late, but-but, he\xc2\x92ll be there. And he\xc2\x92ll bring you some cold soda, if\nwant you need him for is that you\xc2\x92re really hot.'
Joey	 What do ya say? What do ya say?'
Phoebe	 Well, I, I like the idea of naming him after someone I love, and Joey\nand Chandler are great names. (They both stare at her.) But, all right, I\ndon\xc2\x92t\xc2\x97maybe I\xc2\x92ll just name him The Hulk.'
Joey	 I knew I shouldn\xc2\x92t have mentioned it! That\xc2\x92s what I wanted to\nname my kid!'
Rachel	 Hey, Mon, if you were hoping to sleep with Joshua the first time\ntonight, which one of these would you want to be wearing. (She\xc2\x92s holding two frilly,\nlace nighties.)'
Monica	 Y\xc2\x92know what? It really creeps me out choosing other\npeople\xc2\x92s sex clothes.'
Rachel	 Sorry. I\xc2\x92m so exited! I\xc2\x92ve been waiting for this for months! I\ngot my hair coloured! I got new sheets! I\xc2\x92m making him a very fancy meal. '
Monica	 Um-hmm.'
Rachel	 What am I making him by the way?'
Monica	 Well, you\xc2\x92re making him a frieze salad with goat cheese and pine\nnuts, wild nuts, wild rice, roast asparagus, and salmon au croup.'
Rachel	 I thought I was making him filet mignon? '
Monica	 Yeah, you were, but you decided to make salmon because you had some left\nover at the restaurant. And then you realised if you (Points at Rachel) bitched about it,\nthen you (Points to herself) would stop cooking, and you (Points at Rachel) would have to\nmake your famous baked potato and Diet Coke.'
Rachel	 Wow, I really get crabby when I cook.'
Ross	 Hey!'
Joey	 Hey!'
Chandler	 Hey!'
Ross	 So uh, Emily called last night\xc2\x85'
Chandler	 And now you\xc2\x92re giving me the message!'
Ross	 Turns out them Emily is just crazy about Susan. Yeah, they\xc2\x92re\ngoing to the theatre together! They\xc2\x92re going to dinner! They\xc2\x92re going horseback\nriding!'
Phoebe	 God, Susan is so fun!'
Ross	 Look, this is just a little too familiar, okay? For like, for like six\nmonths before Carol and I spilt up, all I heard was
Chandler	 You actually think that something can happen between Emily and Susan?'
Ross	 Hey, they\xc2\x92re going to the gym together! Two women! Stretching!\nY\xc2\x92know they-they take a steam together! Things get a little playful\xc2\x97didn\xc2\x92t\nyou see Personal Best?'
Joey	 No, but I\xc2\x92m gonna!'
Chandler	 Hi! Hi! You\xc2\x92re crazy! Okay? This is Emily. Emily is straight.'
Ross	 How do you know? I mean we thought Carol was straight before I married\nher!'
Phoebe	 Yeah, I definitely. I don\xc2\x92t like the name Ross.'
Ross	 What a weird way to kick me when I\xc2\x92m down.'
Phoebe	 No! No! I-I meant for the baby!'
Ross	 Oh. What\xc2\x92s wrong with Ross?'
Phoebe	 Well, it\xc2\x92s just y\xc2\x92know that something like this would never to\nlike The Hulk, y\xc2\x92know\xc2\x85'
Ross	 Actually that-that\xc2\x92s not true, in The Incredible Hulk uh, No.\n72, Dr. Bruce Banner found\xc2\x85 (Sees everyone staring at him and stops.) Y\xc2\x92know,\nugh, nevermind, my girlfriend\xc2\x92s a lesbian. (Leaves.)'
Phoebe	 So, I decided I\xc2\x92m definitely going to go with either Joey or\nChandler.'
Joey	 Oh! Oh-oh, you gotta pick Joey! I mean, name one famous person named\nChandler.'
Chandler	 Raymond Chandler.'
Joey	 Someone you didn\xc2\x92t make up!'
Chandler	 Okay, there are no famous Joey\xc2\x92s. Except for, huh, Joey\nButtafucco.'
Joey	 Yeah, that guy really hurt us.'
Phoebe	 Well, how about a compromise then, okay? What if it\xc2\x92s like\ny\xc2\x92know, Chanoey?'
Chandler	 Okay, look, Joey! Come on, think about it, first of all, he\xc2\x92ll\nnever be President. There\xc2\x92s never gonna be a President Joey.'
Joey	 All right look man, I didn\xc2\x92t want to bring this up, but Chandler, is\nthe stupidest name I ever heard in my life! It\xc2\x92s not even a name; it\xc2\x92s barely\neven a word. Okay? It\xc2\x92s kinda like chandelier, but it\xc2\x92s not! All right?\nIt\xc2\x92s a stupid, stupid non-name!'
Chandler	 Wow, you\xc2\x92re, you\xc2\x92re right. I have a horrible, horrible name.'
Joey	 I\xc2\x92m sorry man, I didn\xc2\x92t\xc2\x97I\xc2\x92m-I\xc2\x92m sorry. I\xc2\x92m\nsorry. (Goes over and comforts him.) '
Chandler	 Okay.'
Joey	 So I guess it\xc2\x92s Joey then!'
Joshua	 This is so nice. Thank you for doing this.'
Rachel	 Ohh, please! Cooking soothes me. (They kiss.) Ahh. So, dig in!'
Joshua	 Great! Oh, it all looks sooo good!'
Rachel	 (taking a bite) Hmmm!'
Joshua	 Oh my God!'
Rachel	 Oh I know, my God, this is so\xc2\x97this rice is so\xc2\x97I am so good.'
Joshua	 Behind you?'
Rachel	 (sees the chick and the duck) Oh, yeah, I\xc2\x92m sorry. They used to\nlive here; sometimes they migrate back over.'
Joshua	 (getting up and backing away from they.) Is there ah, is there some way\nthey can not be here. It\xc2\x92s just ah, farm birds really kinda freak me out!'
Rachel	 Yeah, sure, okay. Okay.'
Joey	 (answering the door.) Hey, how did you do that?! Come on in. (He brings\nthem inside.)'
Rachel	 All gone! So, farm birds, huh?'
Joshua	 Yeah, it\xc2\x92s-it\xc2\x92s my only weird thing, I swear. And I-I-I\nwould\xc2\x92ve told you about it, but I didn\xc2\x92t know they would be here.'
Rachel	 Oh.'
Joshua	 So, all right.'
Rachel	 Okay. So, can I serve you a little of\xc2\x97What? What? What? (She sees\nthat Joshua isn\xc2\x92t relaxed.)'
Joshua	 Nothing I uh, it\xc2\x92s just that I know that they\xc2\x92re still out\nthere.'
Rachel	 But, they\xc2\x92re across the hall! I mean that\xc2\x92s two doors away, it\nwould take them a long time to peck their way back over here.'
Joshua	 Okay, that\xc2\x92s-that\xc2\x92s not funny. Uhh.'
Rachel	 Okay, y\xc2\x92know, would you feel better if we went someplace else? I\nmean we could pack all this stuff up and y\xc2\x92know go to your apartment.'
Joshua	 Oh, they\xc2\x92re working on this week, it\xc2\x92s a total mess. But uh,\nI\xc2\x92m staying at my parents\xc2\x92 house, we could go there.'
Rachel	 Your parents\xc2\x92?'
Joshua	 Yeah, they\xc2\x92re out of town.'
Rachel	 Ohh.'
Joshua	 Yeah-yeah, it\xc2\x92s this huge place, and-and it\xc2\x92s got this\ngorgeous view of the park, and very, very romantic. What do you say?'
Rachel	 Yeah that works.'
Joshua	 They-they-they can smell fear.'
Ross	 (opening the door.) Hey!'
Carol	 Hey! How\xc2\x92s Ben?'
Ross	 Well, I asked him if he wanted to eat, he said, "No." I asked\nhim if he wanted to sleep, he said, "No." I asked him what he wanted to do, he\nsaid, "No." So, he\xc2\x92s sweeping. (We see Ben playing with a broom and a\ndustpan.)'
Carol	 Hey, Ben! Hey!'
Ross	 So umm, any word from Susan?'
Carol	 Ooh, yeah! She said she\xc2\x92s having sooo much fun with Emily.'
Ross	 Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh, by the by, did it uh, did it ever occur to you that, I\ndon\xc2\x92t know, maybe they might be having a little too much fun?'
Carol	 What\xc2\x92s too much fun?'
Ross	 Y\xc2\x92know, the kind of fun, you and Susan had when we were married.'
Carol	 Oh my God, you are so paranoid! '
Ross	 Am I?!'
Carol	 Yes!'
Ross	 Am I?!'
Carol	 I can\xc2\x92t speak for Emily, but Susan is in a loving, committed\nrelationship.'
Ross	 Uh-huh, Carol, so were we. All right, just-just imagine for a moment,\nSusan meets someone and-and they really hit it off. Y\xc2\x92know? Say-say they\xc2\x92re\ncoming back from the theatre, and they-they stop at a pub for a couple of drinks,\nthey\xc2\x92re laughing, y\xc2\x92know, someone innocently touches someone else\xc2\x85\nThere\xc2\x92s electricity, it\xc2\x92s new. It\xc2\x92s exciting. Are you telling me there\nisn\xc2\x92t even the slightest possibility of something happening?'
Carol	 Maybe.'
Ross	 OH MY GOD!! I didn\xc2\x92t really believe it until you just said it!!'
Joshua	 \xc2\x85and even though none of the other kids believed me, I swear to\nGod, that duck pushed me!'
Rachel	 Wow! This place is fabulous!'
Joshua	 Yeah, yeah, let me show you around. This is the uh, downstairs living\nroom.'
Rachel	 Whoa-whoa, there\xc2\x92s two living rooms? God, growing up here, this\nplace must\xc2\x92ve been a real babe magnet.'
Joshua	 Yeah, well, it would\xc2\x92ve been, but uh, my parents just moved here.'
Rachel	 Ohh, you should know, this place is a real babe magnet. Wanna make out?'
Joshua	 Hey, here\xc2\x92s an idea. Why don\xc2\x92t uh, I put the food in the\nfridge and we can eat it later?'
Rachel	 That sounds like a plan. Umm, is there a place I can go freshen up?'
Joshua	 Oh yeah, yeah uh, it\xc2\x92s down the hall and uh, second door to your\nleft.'
Rachel	 Ah.'
Mrs. Burgin	 Oh, hi, darling!'
Joshua	 Mom, Dad, what are you guys doing here?'
Mrs. Burgin	 Oh, well we cut the trip short.'
Mr. Burgin	 France sucks!'
Joshua	 Umm, this may be a little weird, but I-I-I got a date here.'
Mrs. Burgin	 Oh, say no more!'
Mr. Burgin	 We\xc2\x92ll just grab some food and take it with us right upstairs,\nand we\xc2\x92ll be right out of you hair.'
Joshua	 Oh, that-that would be great. So you didn\xc2\x92t even get to Italy?'
Mr. Burgin	 Yep, sucks!'
Rachel	 Hi you!'
Joshua	 Oh my God!'
Rachel	 I know, I can do more than cook.'
Mr. Burgin	 I like her. She sees smart.'

Joshua	 Uhh, Rachel, my parents\xc2\x85'
Rachel	 Ohh! It\xc2\x92s so nice to meet you. (She goes over and shakes their\nhands.) Hello. '
Mr. Burgin	 Hi.'
Rachel	 Hello.'
Mrs. Burgin	 Hello. Well, Joshua, that $500 was for groceries.'
Rachel	 What? This-this, no, oh no, no-no-no, this is\nnot\xc2\x97that\xc2\x92s-that\xc2\x92s not what it is. See, see, okay, I work in fashion, see\nand-and, this is a real dress actually. It\xc2\x92s-it\xc2\x92s, they\xc2\x92re-they\xc2\x92re\nwearing it in Milan, so part of my job is too wear the clothes, and then I see how people\nrespond, and then I report back to my superiors at Bloomingdale\xc2\x92s, so\xc2\x85\nAnd obviously in uh, in-in this case, (She grabs a pen and paper) I am going to report\nback, "USA not ready."'
Mrs. Burgin	 Maybe in L.A?'
Rachel	 Yes!'
Joshua	 There you go.'
Mr. Burgin	 So, have you kids eaten yet?'
Rachel	 Well, we were going to do that after\xc2\x97I mean umm, next.'
Mr. Burgin	 Well, we\xc2\x92re starving, why don\xc2\x92t we all go get something to\neat?'
Rachel	 Oh, yeah, well\xc2\x85 Yeah, no use wasting this baby, just lyin\xc2\x92\naround the house. '
Mr. Burgin	 So\xc2\x85 We go eat.'
Rachel	 Yes.'
Mr. Burgin	 You\xc2\x92ll wear that. We\xc2\x92ll be eating, and of course,\nyou\xc2\x92ll be wearing that.'
Joey	 Dude, I am sorry about what I said!'
Chandler	 No, no, you\xc2\x92re right, it is a ridiculous name!'
Joey	 It\xc2\x92s not that bad.'
Chandler	 Yes it is! From now on, I have no first name.'
Joey	 So, you\xc2\x92re just Bing?'
Chandler	 I have no name.'
Phoebe	 All right, so, what are we supposed to call you?'
Chandler	 Okay uh, for now, temporarily, you can call me, Clint.'
Joey	 No way are you cool enough to pull of Clint.'
Chandler	 Okay, so what name am I cool enough to pull off?'
Phoebe	 Umm, Gene.'
Chandler	 It\xc2\x92s Clint. It\xc2\x92s Clint! (He heads for his bedroom.)'
Joey	 See you later, Gene.'
Phoebe	 Bye, Gene.'
Chandler	 It\xc2\x92s Clint! Clint!'
Joey	 What\xc2\x92s up with Gene?'
Monica	 So, you wore your nightie to dinner?'
Rachel	 Oh, yeah. And uh, the best part though, when the uh, waiter spilled\nwater down my back, I jumped up, and my boob popped out.'
Phoebe	 Oh my God!'
Monica	 Oh, no!'
Rachel	 No, it\xc2\x92s all right. I got nice boobs. (Phoebe and Monica nod there\nheads in agreement.)'
Ross	 (returning from the phone.) So, I just picked up a message from Emily, she\nand Susan are going to a poetry reading together! '
Rachel	 So?'
Ross	 So! Poetry? Susan\xc2\x92s gay! They\xc2\x92re being gay together!'
Monica	 Emily\xc2\x92s straight.'
Ross	 Oh, wake up!'
Phoebe	 Wow, Carol really messed you up!'
Ross	 Excuse me?'
Phoebe	 Yeah, she turned you into this-this-this untrusting, crazy, jealous,\nsycophant. (They all look at her.) All right, so I don\xc2\x92t know what sycophant means,\nbut the rest is right.'
Ross	 Look, I don\xc2\x92t know what you\xc2\x92re talking about, I am not a crazy,\njealous person.'
Rachel	 Huh.'
Ross	 What?'
Rachel	 She\xc2\x92s totally right! When we were together, you got all freaked out\nabout Mark and there was nothing going on.'
Monica	 This totally makes sense!'
Ross	 It does not!'
Monica	 Oh, sure it does! In high school, you weren\xc2\x92t jealous at all even\nthough all your girlfriends were cheating on you!'
Phoebe	 All right, all right, so up until \xc2\x9192-93 he was very trusting, then\n\xc2\x9294 hit, Carol left him and bamn! Paranoid city!'
Rachel	 Absolutely! Absolutely!'
Monica	 This is so much fun!'
Ross	 This is not fun!'
Monica	 Look, all we\xc2\x92re trying to say is, don\xc2\x92t let what happened with\nCarol ruin what you got with Emily.'
Phoebe	 Yeah. The \xc2\x9292 Ross wouldn\xc2\x92t.'
Ross	 Well, I still think I was right about that whole Mark thing.'
Rachel	 What\xc2\x97yeah\xc2\x97what, y\xc2\x92know what? I hope Emily is a\nlesbian.'
Phoebe	 Drum roll.'
Chandler	 (entering) Okay. Okay. All right. Help! Am I a Mark, or a John?'
Joey	 Nah, you\xc2\x92re not tall enough to be a Mark, but you might make a good\nBarney.'
Chandler	 All right look, am I serious, okay? Tomorrow at 3
Phoebe	 You\xc2\x92re actually going through with this?'
Chandler	 Hey, look, this name has been holding me back my entire life. Okay,\nit\xc2\x92s probably why kids picked on me in school, and why I never do well with\nwomen\xc2\x85 So, as of 4 o\xc2\x92clock tomorrow, I\xc2\x92m either gonna be Mark Johnson or\nJohn Markson.'
Phoebe	 You got problems because of you! Not your name! All right, this has got\nto stop! Chandler is a great name! In fact\xc2\x97yes, (To Joey) I\xc2\x92m, I\xc2\x92m sorry. I\nknow you really wanted me to name the baby Joey, but eh, so, I\xc2\x92m-I\xc2\x92m, I\xc2\x92m\ngonna, I\xc2\x92m gonna name the baby Chandler.'
Chandler	 (pleased) Really?!'
Phoebe	 Yeah, but you have to keep the name too!'
Chandler	 Okay. Thanks.'
Phoebe	 Okay!'
Chandler	 You wanna hug it out?'
Phoebe	 Yeah!'
Phoebe	 Yay! '
Chandler	 Yay! '
Phoebe	 Yay\xc2\x97oh\xc2\x97yay! Okay, I gotta go tell Frank and Alice! Right now!'
Chandler	 Okay!'
Phoebe	 Ooh, uh\xc2\x85 (She grabs her coat and runs out.)'
Chandler	 Bye, Pheebs!'
Phoebe	 Okay, bye! '
Chandler	 Ha! Ha! Ha!'
Joey	 Ohh! (Realises it was all a trick to get Phoebe to name the baby\nChandler.)'

Ross	 Nice luggage.'
Carol	 I was gonna say\xc2\x85'
Susan	 Hey!'
Ross	 Hi!'
Emily	 Hey! I missed you.'
Ross	 Oh, I missed you too.'
Susan	 (To Emily) Thanks for everything, I had such a great time.'
Emily	 Oh, so did I.'
Ross	 (To Carol) No tongue. (And gives her the thumbs up.)'
