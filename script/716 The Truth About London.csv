Monica	 All right, what about the third guy?'
Chandler	 You mean the guy who kept staring at your chest?'
Monica	 Can you blame him?'
Chandler	 Sorry, I just don\xc2\x92t like the idea of when I say, "I\ndo," he\xc2\x92s thinking, "Yeah, I\xc2\x92d do her too!"'
Monica	 Well then we still have a problem.'
Chandler	 Yeah!'
Phoebe	 (returning with Joey) With what?'
Monica	 Well, we\xc2\x92re trying to find someone to perform our wedding and\nthey\xc2\x92re all either boring or annoying or y\xc2\x92know, can\xc2\x92t stop staring at the\nladies. (Points to her chest.)'
Phoebe	 Oo! You should have one of us do it!'
Monica	 Phoebe, we\xc2\x92re getting married, married; not sixth grade\nmarried.'
Phoebe	 No! No! It\xc2\x92s-it\xc2\x92s uh a real thing! Anyone can get ordained on\nthe Internet and perform like weddings and stuff!'
Monica	 Are you serious?'
Phoebe	 Yes! A friend of mine did it and it\xc2\x92s totally legal!'
Joey	 I call it!!'
Phoebe	 What?! No! It was my idea!'
Chandler	 Guys thank you very much but neither of you is marrying us.'
Joey	 Does calling it not mean anything anymore?!'
Chandler	 We are going to have a legitimate member of the clergy! And when I say\nlegitimate I mean, gay and in control of his saliva!'
Rachel	 Ben y\xc2\x92know when uh, when you were a baby, you and I used to hang\nout all the time. \xc2\x91Cause I was, I was your daddy\xc2\x92s girlfriend.'

Rachel	 Hey! We were not on a\xc2\x97Okay. That\xc2\x92s fine! Fine.\nY\xc2\x92know what Ben? One day when you are a lot older I am going to tell you that entire\nstory over a pitcher of real margaritas, okay?'
Ben	 When\xc2\x92s my daddy coming back?'
Rachel	 (checks her watch) Fifty-two minutes. (Pause) So no-no brothers and\nsisters, huh? That must be nice. You don\xc2\x92t have to share stuff.'
Ben	 Sharing is good.'
Rachel	 Oh, you\xc2\x92re one of those. But y\xc2\x92know what? I have two\nsisters of my own and we just-just tortured each other.'
Ben	 Really? Like how?'
Rachel	 Well y\xc2\x92know, we would umm, repeat everything the other said, or uh,\nwe\xc2\x92d jump out of closets to scare each other, or switch the sugar for the salt so\nthey\xc2\x92d put salt on their cereal.'
Ben	 (laughs) That\xc2\x92s a good one.'
Rachel	 Yeah? You like that one?'
Ben	 Yeah, you\xc2\x92re funny.'
Rachel	 I\xc2\x92m funny? Oh thank God! Well hey, I\xc2\x92ve got a ton of these!\nUmm, oh hear\xc2\x97Do you want a good one? Here\xc2\x92s a good one. Umm, you uh, you take a\nquarter, take a quarter and, and you blacken the edge. Right? (Does so.) And then you say\nto person, I bet you can\xc2\x92t roll this quarter from your forehead to your chin without\nit leaving your face. And then when they do it, they\xc2\x92re left with a big black pencil\nline right down the center of their face.'
Ben	 Can I do it to you?'
Rachel	 Yeah, I-I-I-I\xc2\x92m funny Ben, but I\xc2\x92m not stupid. Okay?'
Joey	 So, did you uh, find anyone to marry you guys yet?'
Chandler	 No, but Horny for Monica Minister called, wanting to know if we were\nstill together.'
Monica	 We\xc2\x92re never gonna find anybody.'
Joey	 Well then let me do it!'
Chandler	 Joe\xc2\x85'
Joey	 No-no-no! Look, I\xc2\x92ve been thinking about it. I\xc2\x92m an actor right?\nSo I won\xc2\x92t get nervous talking in front of people.'
Monica	 Joey look it\xc2\x92s really sweet\xc2\x85'
Joey	 No-no-no-no look no! I won\xc2\x92t spit, and I won\xc2\x92t stare at\nMonica\xc2\x92s breasts! Y\xc2\x92know? Everyone knows I\xc2\x92m an ass man!'
Monica	 That is true.'
Joey	 Yeah and the most important thing is that it won\xc2\x92t be some like,\nstranger up there who barely knows you. It\xc2\x92ll be me! And I swear I\xc2\x92ll do a\nreally good job. Plus, y\xc2\x92know I love you guys and-and it would really mean a lot to\nme.'
Chandler	 (To Monica) Y\xc2\x92know, we haven\xc2\x92t found anybody else.'
Monica	 It might be kinda cool.'
Joey	 So I can do it?'
Chandler	 Yeah you can do it.'
Joey	 All right!!! Okay!! All right! Okay-okay, I gotta get started on my\nspeech! Oh, wait a minute, Internet ministers can still have sex right?'
Chandler	 Yeah.'
Joey	 Okay.'
Monica	 Hey Pheebs, how\xc2\x92s it going?'
Phoebe	 Oh, I have a headache. A horrible headache!'
Monica	 Oh, I\xc2\x92m sorry. Can I get you something?'
Phoebe	 Oh my God, you\xc2\x92ve got to stop chattering!'
Monica	 Here, take a couple of these. (She gets up to grab a couple of pills.)'
Phoebe	 What is it?'
Monica	 It\xc2\x92s Hexadrin.'
Phoebe	 Oh no, I don\xc2\x92t believe in Western medicine. No, if you just apply\npressure to these points right here. (She\xc2\x92s pinching the bit of skin between her\nright thumb and forefinger with her left hand.) Then your hand starts to hurt and you\nstill have a headache, so thanks. (Takes the pills.)'
Monica	 Okay, while we\xc2\x92re waiting for these pills to kick in, I\xc2\x92m\ngonna sit you down on the couch. Come on. (Phoebe gets up and goes with her.) Get some\nnice soft pillows under your head, I\xc2\x92m gonna turn the TV on and you can watch\nwhatever you want. And I\xc2\x92m\xc2\x97Sit down\xc2\x97(She sits down on the couch)\xc2\x97gonna\nmake you some tea. And then, I\xc2\x92m gonna rub your feet.'
Phoebe	 Oh.'
Joey	 Oh! My head! Oh! (He\xc2\x92s sitting on the chair, lies back, and puts his\nfeet up for Monica to rub.) Oh!'
Rachel	 Coming. '
Ross	 I have a bone to pick with you.'
Rachel	 Uh-oh.'
Ross	 Yes! Ben learned a little trick.'
Rachel	 Oh yeah? Did he pull the old\xc2\x85 (She is waving her hand up and down\nher face. She\xc2\x92s thinking about the pencil mark.)'
Ross	 That\xc2\x92s right! That\xc2\x92s right! Saran Wrap on the toilet seat\nso the pee goes everywhere!'
Rachel	 Oh that.'
Ross	 Yeah that! You know I hate practical jokes! They\xc2\x92re mean and\nthey\xc2\x92re stupid and-and I don\xc2\x92t want my son learning them!'
Rachel	 Oh, come on! Saran Wrap on the toilet seat, you don\xc2\x92t think\nthat\xc2\x92s just a little funny?!'
Ross	 I was barefoot. Now tell me, the toilet thing is the only thing you taught\nhim right?'
Rachel	 (looking at his mark) Yes.'
Phoebe	 It\xc2\x92s amazing! My headache is completely gone! What are those pills\ncalled?'
Monica	 Hexadrin. (She gets the box out of her purse.)'
Phoebe	 Oh, I love you Hexadrin! (She kisses the box.) Oh look! It comes with a\nstory! (She pulls out the instructions and side affects paper.)'
Monica	 No Phoebe, those are like the side affects and stuff.'
Phoebe	 Say what?'
Monica	 Y\xc2\x92know, the possible side affects.'
Phoebe	 Oh my God! (Starts reading them.) Dizziness, nervousness, drowsiness,\nfacial swelling, nausea, headache\xc2\x97Headache. Vomiting, stomach bleeding, liver damage!\nNow okay, I don\xc2\x92t recall any of this coming up when you gave me these little death\ncapsules! Oh I\xc2\x92m sorry, extra strength death capsules!'
Monica	 Phoebe, relax none of that stuff ever happens! They just put it on there\nfor legal reasons!'
Phoebe	 Why?'
Monica	 In case it happens.'
Joey	 (entering) Hey!'
Chandler	 Hey!'
Joey	 Say hello to Reverend Joey Tribbiani! (Holds up the piece of paper bearing\nthe proof of his ordination.)'
Chandler	 Hey!'
Monica	 You did it! You got ordained?!'
Joey	 Yeah, I just got off the Internet! Man, there is a lot of porn out there!'
Chandler	 Our minister\xc2\x85'
Phoebe	 I have liver damage. Ow! Oh! (She grabs the left side of her torso.)'
Monica	 Phoebe, your liver is right here. (She points to the right side of her\ntorso.)'
Phoebe	 Okay, then I must be disoriented.'
Joey	 Anyway, I started working on what I\xc2\x92m going to say for the ceremony,\ndo you wanna hear it?'
Chandler	 Okay.'
Monica	 Yeah!'
Joey	 Now-now, listen this is just a first draft so\xc2\x85 (Starts to read the\npiece of paper he brought.) "We are gathered here today on this joyous occasion to\ncelebrate the special love that Monica and Chandler share." (Monica and Chandler like\nit so far.) Eh? (He continues reading.) "It is a love based on giving and receiving.\nAs well as having and sharing. And the love that they give and have is shared and\nreceived. And through this having and giving and sharing and receiving." (Phoebe nods\nher approval.) "We too can share and love and have and receive."'
Chandler	 (To Monica) Should we call the spitter?'

Carol	 Hey Rachel! (The camera cuts to her face and we see that Ben pulled the\nquarter trick with her as well.)'
Rachel	 Hi!'
Carol	 What a nice surprise! What are you doing here?'
Rachel	 Well y\xc2\x92know I was just in the neighborhood and I passed by your\nbuilding and I thought to myself, "What\xc2\x92s up with Carol and sweet, little\nBen?"'
Carol	 Can I ask what\xc2\x97Come on in.'
Rachel	 Okay.'
Carol	 Umm uh, I\xc2\x92ll make some coffee and we can uh, chat.'
Rachel	 I\xc2\x92d love that. I would loooove\xc2\x85 (Carol goes to make the coffee\nand she sits down.) So uh, so where is sweet little Ben? I would love to have a little...'
Ben	 (jumping up from behind her chair) Gotcha!! (Rachel jumps up startled.)'
Rachel	 I found him! (To Ben) Very funny, come here! (She sits down on the\ncoffee table and Ben walks up.) That is exactly why I\xc2\x92ve come here to talk to you\nokay?'
Carol	 (from the kitchen) Rach, do you want some sugar in your coffee?'
Rachel	 Yes oh\xc2\x97(To Ben)\xc2\x97Do I want sugar in my coffee? (Ben nods no.)\nNo, just some milk would be good Carol. Thanks. (To Ben) Okay, do you remember all that\nstuff I taught you yesterday?'
Ben	 (mimicking her) Remember all that stuff I taught you yesterday?'
Rachel	 Don\xc2\x92t do that.'
Ben	 Don\xc2\x92t do that.'
Rachel	 Seriously, your dad doesn\xc2\x92t like pranks.'
Ben	 Seriously, your dad doesn\xc2\x92t like pranks.'
Rachel	 Oh damnit!'
Ben	 Oh damnit!'
Rachel	 No! Don\xc2\x92t say that! Don\xc2\x92t say that!'
Ben	 Damnit!'
Rachel	 No don\xc2\x92t! Go back to repeating!'
Ben	 Damnit!'
Rachel	 Oh crap!'

Monica	 Phoebe, your face is fine! Come on, none of this stuff is going to\nhappen to you! Stop being such a baby!'
Phoebe	 Oh, interesting you should call me that! Now that I may never have one!\n(Holds up the warning label.)'
Joey	 Okay you guys, I got a little more written. Are you ready?'
Chandler	 Yeah. O-okay.'
Joey	 (reading) "When I think of the love that these two givers and\nreceivers share, I can not help but envy the lifetime ahead of having and loving and\ngiving and\xc2\x85" And then I can\xc2\x92t think of a good word for right here. (He\npoints to the stop on the paper where he left off.)'
Monica	 How about receiving?'
Joey	 Yes!'
Chandler	 See Joe, not that that\xc2\x92s not grrreat! But, one of the cool things\nabout having somebody we know perform the ceremony is that it can be about us!\nY\xc2\x92know, it can be more personal. You can tell stories about us!'
Joey	 Ooh, like the time you and I went to Atlantic City and I made you laugh so\nhard you threw up your whole steak?! Remember?'
Chandler	 No, not us\xc2\x85 (Motions Joey and him.) Us! (Motions Monica and him.)'
Monica	 I gotcha. Sorry. (To Monica) So, did you ever make him throw up a whole\nanything?'
Phoebe	 Did you ever feed him a poison capsule that made him bleed from the\neyes?'
Monica	 It doesn\xc2\x92t say that!'
Phoebe	 Oh! Suddenly somebody knows all about the side affects!'
Chandler	 See Joe, we want you to tell stories but y\xc2\x92know, romantic\nstories. Nice stories.'
Joey	 Oh. Okay. Ooh! Ooh! Okay, maybe I\xc2\x92ll talk about London! Y\xc2\x92know\nwhen you two hooked up! Only, only I won\xc2\x92t say hooked up. I\xc2\x92ll say, "Began\ntheir beautiful journey\xc2\x85"'
Monica	 There you go!'
Joey	 "\xc2\x85by doin\xc2\x92 it."'
Chandler	 Joe?'
Joey	 Okay. All right. Umm, so uh, so how did it happen? Did your eyes meet\nacross the room? And then the next thing y\xc2\x92know you\xc2\x92re in the bathtub together\nand she\xc2\x92s feeding you strawberries?'
Chandler	 Isn\xc2\x92t that what happened with you and the bride\xc2\x92s maid?'
Joey	 Yeah!! I call that London style.'
Monica	 No that is not what happened with us. Well, I was umm, I was really sad\nthat night because this guy that I was Ross\xc2\x92s mom.'
Joey	 Oh.'

Chandler	 Well, last time I saw him he was heading out the door with the\nbride\xc2\x92s maid and a bucket of strawberries. So uh, you\xc2\x92re not still upset about\nwhat that guy told ya are ya?'
Monica	 Wouldn\xc2\x92t you be?'
Chandler	 Well, look it\xc2\x92s been a really emotional time y\xc2\x92know, and\nyou\xc2\x92ve had a lot to drink. And you\xc2\x92ve just got to let that go okay? I\nmean you were the most beautiful in the room tonight!'
Monica	 Really?'
Chandler	 You kidding? You\xc2\x92re the most beautiful woman in most rooms\xc2\x85\n(She jumps up and kisses him.) (Breaking the kiss.) Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What\xc2\x92s going\non? You and I just made out! You and I are making out?'
Monica	 Well, not anymore.'
Chandler	 But we don\xc2\x92t do that.'
Monica	 I know, I just thought it would be fun.'
Chandler	 How drunk are you?'
Monica	 Drunk enough to know that I want to do this. Not so drunk that you\nshould feel guilty about taking advantage.'
Chandler	 (thinks) That\xc2\x92s the perfect amount!'
Monica	 Okay!'
Monica	 (breaking the kiss) Y\xc2\x92know what\xc2\x92s weird?'
Chandler	 What?'
Monica	 This doesn\xc2\x92t feel weird!'
Chandler	 I know.'

Chandler	 Count of three?'
Monica	 One!'
Chandler	 Two!'
Monica	 Two!'
Monica and Chandler	 Three! (They lift up the covers and check each other\nout, then come back up with silly grins on their faces.)'
Chandler	 Well I think it\xc2\x92s safe to say that our friendship is effectively\nruined.'
Monica	 Eh, we weren\xc2\x92t that close anyway!'
Chandler	 Eh!'
Chandler	 Joey! Joey! Joey! J-J-Joey-Joey-J-Joey! (Monica hides under the covers\nas Joey enters. Remember?)'
Joey	 Hey!'
Chandler	 Hey Joe! I was just watching a movie-e-e\xc2\x85 (Notices that the TV is\nturned off.)'
Joey	 Oh, dude I\xc2\x92m so sorry!'

Chandler	 They\xc2\x92re in my bag over there. (Points.)'
Joey	 Ah. (Joey walks to Chandler\xc2\x92s bag by getting as far away from\nChandler\xc2\x92s bed as possible.)'
Chandler	 Uh, could you leave me one?'
Joey	 (pause) For just you?'
Chandler	 Yeah.'
Joey	 Hey listen, why don\xc2\x92t you come downstairs with me? There\xc2\x92s some\nreally nice girls down there.'
Chandler	 No I-I-I\xc2\x92m fine.'
Joey	 All right, here you go buddy. (He tosses him one.) Go nuts. (Exits.)'
Joey	 That\xc2\x92s what that was?! \xc2\x91Cause that other thing? I thought you\nwere on to something, but it did nothing for me.'
Monica	 Okay, can we change the topic? Because it\xc2\x92s really doing\nnothing for me.'
Joey	 Oh\xc2\x85 (To Chandler) Can you imagine if I hadn\xc2\x92t left you that last\none? You two might\xc2\x92ve never gotten together. Ooh-ooh! Could you imagine if I sent\nthat hooker up to the room like I was gonna?! It\xc2\x92s like it was in the stars!'
Phoebe	 Yeah, it\xc2\x92s totally meant to be. (To Monica) Tell him who you\noriginally wanted to hook up with that night.'
Monica	 What?!'
Chandler	 What?'
Phoebe	 (To Joey) What?!'
Chandler	 Who did you originally want to hook up with?'
Monica	 Okay, fine but please don\xc2\x92t be upset! Okay? I was really\ndepressed okay? And really drunk! I just wanted something stupid and meaningless. I just\nwanted\xc2\x85just sex. So, when I\xc2\x85went to your room that night\xc2\x85I was actually\nlooking\xc2\x85for Joey. (Joey smiles.)'
Joey	 Yeah baby! (Chandler glares at him.) No baby!'

Chandler	 (To Monica) So you came to the room looking for Joey? Did you ever\nin-intend on telling me about this?'
Monica	 No because it-it didn\xc2\x92t seem important.'
Chandler	 Oh, it\xc2\x92s not important? It\xc2\x92s not important?! If it\nwasn\xc2\x92t for a bride\xc2\x92s maid you\xc2\x92d be marrying him (Points to Joey) not me!'
Monica	 Noo!! The point is that is was you that was there that night! It\nis you that I am marrying! It is you that I feel in love with!'
Joey	 And it is a love that is based on having and giving and receiv\xc2\x97(Shuts\nup on Monica\xc2\x92s glare.)'
Chandler	 I don\xc2\x92t believe it. The most romantic night of my life and\nI\xc2\x92m runner up.'
Monica	 Chandler, please! Do you know how unbelievably glad I am that Joey was\nnot there that night?!'
Joey	 Hey! (Monica turns and looks at him) Now I\xc2\x92m a man of the cloth, but\nI still have feelings!'
Chandler	 (To Joey) Look there is no way you\xc2\x92re doing this wedding now.\nOkay?'
Joey	 What?! That\xc2\x92s not fair! It\xc2\x92s not my fault! I was off with my\nbride\xc2\x92s maid! And who\xc2\x92s to say I would\xc2\x92ve even said yes?! (To Monica) I\nmean I would\xc2\x92ve said yes. Chandler look y-y-you are making way to big a deal out of\nthis, all right? Look, everything worked out okay!'
Chandler	 Okay, it\xc2\x92s just weird! Okay? I don\xc2\x92t want to be standing\ntheir saying my vows and then having the mental image of you and Monica! I-I-I need\xc2\x85I\ndon\xc2\x92t know what I need. I need a walk.'
Monica	 Wait Chandler come on, let\xc2\x92s\xc2\x97it\xc2\x92s not a big deal!'
Chandler	 It is to me. You wanted to sleep with Batman, and instead you\nhad to settle for Robin. (Walks out and slams the door.)'
Joey	 This is crazy.'
Phoebe	 I know! Robin is so gay!'
Rachel	 So now what have we agreed?'
Ben	 No more pranks.'
Rachel	 And-and what else?'
Ben	 That you and daddy were not on a break.'
Rachel	 Very good.'
Ross	 Rachel! What are you doing here?'
Rachel	 I\xc2\x92m just visiting my good friend Carol.'
Ross	 Your good friend?'
Rachel	 Yeah!'
Ross	 What\xc2\x92s her last name?'
Rachel	 Carol\xc2\x85Lesbian?'
Ross	 Nice. And by the way that uh, that line down my face?'
Rachel	 What line?'
Ross	 Wh-wh-what line? The line that prompted a student in my last class\nof the day to say uh, (In a college frat boy voice) "Dude, don\xc2\x92t you ever was\nyour face?"'
Rachel	 All right, I\xc2\x92m sorry. I\xc2\x92m sorry I didn\xc2\x92t tell you but you\nwere so mad already!'
Ross	 Of course I was mad! I told you I-I hate this stuff! Okay? It-it\xc2\x92s\nnot funny!'
Carol	 (entering from the kitchen) Hey Ross!'
Ross	 Hi.'
Carol	 What\xc2\x92s not funny?'
Ross	 Practical jokes.'
Carol	 Oh I\xc2\x85I think they\xc2\x92re funny.'
Ross	 You have a line down your face.'
Carol	 What? (Goes and checks.)'
Rachel	 Okay, maybe they are not funny to you\xc2\x85'
Carol	 (yelling from the bathroom) Oh my God!'
Rachel	 Or Carol! But they\xc2\x92re funny to kids and who is it hurting?!'
Ross	 Uh, y\xc2\x92know what? I\xc2\x92ll tell you who it hurts! It hurts the kid\nwho has all his clothes stolen in gym class so he has to go to the principal\xc2\x92s office\nwearing nothing but a catcher\xc2\x92s mitt!'
Rachel	 That was you?! We heard about you in Junior High! Did you really\njust shake your fist in the air and shout, "I will be revenged?!"'
Ross	 I will be! Listen, I don\xc2\x92t want you teaching my son that stuff\nanymore. Okay?'
Rachel	 Fine. Fine, but I\xc2\x92ll have you know that once I taught him that\nstuff he called me Fun Aunt Rachel. And I loved being Fun Aunt Rachel but I\xc2\x92ll go\nback to being Boring and Uncomfortable Aunt Rachel if that\xc2\x92s what you want!'
Ross	 No that\xc2\x92s not what I want. Uh, I\xc2\x92m glad you guys were bonding\nbut I\xc2\x85'
Rachel	 Look he doesn\xc2\x92t have any brothers or sisters, somebody\xc2\x92s gonna\nhave to teach him this stuff! And I haven\xc2\x92t taught him anything that a normal\n6-year-old doesn\xc2\x92t know anyway!'
Ben	 (yelling from off camera) Crap!!'
Rachel	 I gotta go! (Runs out.)'
Joey	 Hey.'
