Chandler	 No-no-no-no, we're done."

Monica	 Aunt Syl, stop yelling! All I'm saying is that if you had told\nme vegetarian lasagna, I would have made vegetarian lasagna. (pauses, listens to person on\nphone) Well, the meat's only every third layer, maybe you could scrape."
Joey	 Ross, did you really read all these baby books?'
Ross	 Yup! You could plunk me down in the middle of any woman's uterus, no\ncompass, and I can find my way out of there like that! (snaps fingers)"
Phoebe	 Ooh, this is cool...it says in some parts of the world, people actually\neat the placenta. (Joey grimaces)'
Chandler	 And, we're done with the yogurt. (Sets yogurt down on table)"
Phoebe	 (softly) Sorry. (Camera pans back to Monica, still on phone)'
Monica	 Aunt Syl, I did this as a favor, I am not a caterer. What do you want me\nto do with a dozen lasagnas? (listens to Aunt Syl on phone, looks shocked) Nice talk, Aunt\nSyl. (in New York accent) You kiss Uncle Freddie with that mouth?'
Joey	 Hey Ross, listen, you know that right now, your baby's only this big?\n(measures about 2 inches with his thumb and index finger) This is your baby. (in baby-like\nvoice) Hi Daddy! "
Ross	 (waves) Hello!'
Joey	 (in baby-like voice) How come you don't live with Mommy? (pause;\nshows Ross less than amused) How come Mommy lives with that other lady? (pause; Ross still\nlooks less than amused; Joey smiling) What's a lesbian? (playfully hits Ross)"
Rachel	 Honey, you can say it, Poconos, Poconos, it's like Poc-o-nos (touching\nPaolo's nose with forefinger with each syllable)"
Paolo	 Ah, poke (Paolo touches Rachel's nose) a (touches nose again)\nnose, mmm (they rub noses, then kisses her)"
Joey, Chandler, and Ross	 (sitting in living room, imitating Paolo)\nMma, Mma, Mmaah'
Monica	 So, did I hear Poconos?'
Rachel	 Yes, my sister's giving us her place for the weekend."
Phoebe	 Woo-hoo, first weekend away together!'
Monica	 Yeah, that's a big step."
Rachel	 I know...'
Chandler	 (to Ross) Ah, it's just a weekend, big deal!"
Ross	 Wasn't this supposed to be just a fling, huh? Shouldn't it be...(makes\nflinging motions with hands) flung by now?"
Rachel	 I mean, we are way past the fling thing, I mean, I am feeling things\nthat I've only read about in Danielle Steele books, you know? I mean, when I'm with him,\nI'm totally, totally..."
Ross	 ...nauseous, I'm physically nauseous. What am I supposed to do, huh? Call\nimmigration? (pauses, looks suddenly inspired) I could call immigration!"
Joey	 I love babies, with their little baby shoes, and their little baby toes,\nand their little baby hands... '
Chandler	 Ok, you're going to have to stop that, forever!"
Joey	 Need a new table.'
Chandler	 You think?'
Carol	 Hey hey, come on in!'
Ross	 Hey, hello! mmwa! (kisses Carol) I brought all the books, and Monica sends\nher love, along with this lasagna. '
Carol	 Oh great! Is it vegetarian, 'cause Susan doesn't eat meat."
Ross	 (pauses) I'm pretty sure that it is..."
Carol	 So, I got the results of the amnio today.'
Ross	 (making flinging gestures with hands) Oh, tell me, tell me, is\neverything, uhh....? '
Carol	 Totally and completely healthy!'
Ross	 Oh, that's great, that is great! (Hugs and kisses Carol. Then picks up a\npicture frame)"
Ross	 Hey, when did you and Susan meet Huey Lewis?'
Carol	 Uh, that's our friend Tanya."
Ross	 (surprised, chuckling nervously) Of course it's your friend\nTanya. (looks up frightenedly)"
Carol	 Don't you want to know about the sex?"
Ross	 (chuckles nervously) The sex? (chuckles) Um, I'm having enough\ntrouble with the image of you and Susan together, when you throw in Tanya (miming washing\nhair, that's the best I could think of), yaw..."
Carol	 The sex of the baby, Ross.'
Ross	 Oh, you know the sex of the baby? Oh, oh-oh-oh!'
Carol	 Do you want to know?'
Ross	 No, no, no, no, no, I don't want to know, absolutely not. I think, you\nknow, I think you should know until you look down there, and say, oop, there it is!\n(pauses) Or isn't..."
Susan	 Oh, hello Ross!'
Ross	 Susan...'
Susan	 So, so, did you hear?'
Ross	 Yes, we did, everything's A-OK!"
Susan	 Oh, that's so... (Susan hugs Carol, they giggle, Ross steps away) It\nreally is...do we know...?"
Carol	 Yes, we certainly do, it's going to be..."
Ross	 (flailing arms in protest) Oh, hey hey hey, ho ho ho, hello, guy\nwho doesn't want to know, standing right here!"
Susan	 Oh, well, is it what we thought it would be?'
Carol	 Mm-hmmm (Susan and Carol hug, giggling. Ross stands back, reaches out and\nlightly taps Susan's shoulder)"
Ross	 Ok, what, what...ok, what did we think it was going to be? '
Carol and Susan	 It's a..."
Ross	 (interrupts) No, no, no I don't want to know, don't want to\nknow. Ok, you know, I should probably, I should probably just go. "
Carol	 Well, thanks for the books.'
Ross	 No problem, ok, mmmwa (kisses Carol) oh, mmmwa (kisses Carol's stomach,\nthen punches Susan's shoulder) Susan... (Ross leaves.)"
Susan	 All right, who should we call first, your folks, or Deb and Rona?\n(intercom buzzer rings)'
Carol	 Hello?'
Ross	 (on intercom) Uh, never mind, I don't want to know. (Carol and\nSusan laugh)"
Chandler	 Ok, so it's just because it was my table, I have to buy a new one?"
Joey	 That's the rule."
Chandler	 What rule? There's no rule, if anything, you owe me a table!"
Joey	 How'd you get to that?"
Chandler	 Well, I believe the piece of furniture was fine until your little\nbreakfast adventure with Angela Delvecchio'
Joey	 You knew about that?'
Chandler	 Well, let's just say the impressions you made in the butter left\nlittle to the imagination."
Joey	 Ok, ok, How about if we split it?'
Chandler	 What do you mean, like, buy it together?'
Joey	 Yeah'
Chandler	 You think we're ready for something like that?"
Joey	 Why not?'
Chandler	 Well, it's a pretty big commitment, I mean, what if one of us wants to\nmove out?"
Joey	 Why, are you moving out?'
Chandler	 I'm not moving out. "
Joey	 You'd tell me if you were moving out right"
Chandler	 Yeah, yeah, it's just that with my last roommate Kip..."
Joey	 Aw, I know all about Kip!'
Chandler	 It's just that we bought a hibachi together, and then he ran off and\ngot married, and things got pretty ugly."
Joey	 Well, let me ask you something, was Kip a better roommate than me?'
Chandler	 Aw, don't do that"
Phoebe's Assistant	 We've got a couple changes in your schedule. Your\n4
Phoebe	 Ok, thanks. (assistant leaves, then walks back in)'
Phoebe's Assistant	 Oh, here comes your 3
Paolo	 Buon Giorno, Bella Phoebe!'
Phoebe	 Oh, Paolo, hi, what are you doing here?'
Paolo	 Uh, Racquela tell me you massage, eh?'
Phoebe	 Well, Racquela's right, yeah!"
Phoebe	 Oh, okay, I don't know what you just said, so let's get started."
Paolo	 Uh, I am, uh, being naked?'
Phoebe	 Um, that's really your decision, I mean, some people prefer, you know,\nto take off...oh whoops! You're being naked!"
Rachel	 (to Ross) I can't believe you don't want to know. I mean, I\ncouldn't not know, I mean, if, if the doctor knows, and Carol knows, and Susan knows.... "
Monica	 And Monica knows...'
Ross	 Wha, heh, how could you know, I don't even know!"
Monica	 Carol called me to thank me for the lasagna, I asked, she told me.'
Joey	 So what's it gonna be? (Monica whispers in Joey's ear. Ross gets up and\nwaves arms frantically in protest)"
Ross	 Wait\xc2\x97oh\xc2\x97hey\xc2\x97huh, oh great now he knows, and I don't know!"
Monica	 I'm sorry, I'm just excited about being an aunt!"
Joey	 Or an uncle... '
Joey and Chandler	 Hey Phoebe!'
Ross	 Hi Pheebs!'
Rachel	 Pheebs!'
Phoebe	 Fine!'
Monica	 Phoebe, what's the matter?"
Phoebe	 Nothing, I'm sorry, I'm just, I'm out of sorts."
Customer	 Hey, can we get some cappuccino over here?'
Rachel	 Oh, right, that's me!"
Joey	 Hey, Chandler, that table place closes at 7, come on.'
Chandler	 Fine. (Joey and Chandler walk towards the door)'
Monica	 Phoebe, what is it?'
Phoebe	 All right, you know Paolo?'
Ross	 I'm familiar with his work, yes..."
Phoebe	 Well, he made a move on me.'
Joey	 Whoa, store will be open tomorrow!'
Chandler	 More coffee over here, please!'

Monica	 Well, what happened?'
Phoebe	 Well, he came in for a massage, and everything was fine until.\n(A flashback starts Paolo, lying on massage table, moving his hands up Phoebe's legs.)"
Joey and Chandler	\xc2\xa0 Ooooohh!'
Ross	 My God.'
Monica	 Are you sure?'
Phoebe	 Oh yeah, I'm sure. (Flashback resumes with Phoebe doing a voiceover.)\nAnd all of a sudden his hands weren't the problem anymore. (Flashback continues
Monica	 Was it...?'
Phoebe	 Oh, boy scouts could have camped under there.'
Guys	 Oooooo....'
Rachel	 "Ooo," what?'
Phoebe	 Uma Thurman.'
Monica	 Oh!'
Ross	 The actress!'
Ross	 Thanks Rach.'
Chandler	 So what are you gonna do?'
Ross	 You have to tell her! You have to tell her! It's your moral obligation, as\na friend, as a woman, I think it's a feminist issue! Guys? Guys? (waiting for guys to\nchime in)"
Chandler	 Oh, yeah, you have to tell her.'
Joey	 Feminist issue. That's where I went!"
Phoebe	 She is gonna hate me.'
Ross	(sympathetic yet...) Yeah, well...'
Joey	 Will you pick one, just pick one! Here, how about that one? (points to a\ntable)'
Chandler	 That's patio furniture!"
Joey	 So what, like people are gonna come in and think, "Uh-oh, I\'m outside\nagain?" Of course!'
Chandler	 (gesturing towards another table) What about the birds?'
Joey	 I don\'t know, birds just don\'t say, "Hello, sit here, eat\nsomething."'
Chandler	 You pick one.'
Joey	 All right, how about the ladybugs?'
Chandler	 Oh, so, forget about the birds, but big red insects suggest fine\ndining!'
Joey	 Fine, you want to get the birds, get the birds!'
Chandler	 Not like that, I won't! (pauses) Kip would have liked the birds! (Joey\nturns and gives Chandler a dirty look)"
Phoebe	 Hey!'
Rachel	 Hi Pheebs!'
Phoebe	 Are you moving out?'
Rachel	 No, these aren't all my suitcases. (picks up small blue suitcase and\nshows to Phoebe) This one's Paolo's."
Phoebe	 Um, um, Rachel can we talk for a sec?'
Rachel	 Well, sure...just a sec, though, 'cause Paolo's on his way over."
Phoebe	 Oh! (sits down) Ok, um, ok, um, '
Rachel	 Oh, Pheebs, Pheebs...'
Phoebe	 Ok, um, (clears throat) we haven't known each other for that long a\ntime, and, um, there are three things that you should know about me. One, my friends are\nthe most important thing in my life, two, I never lie, and three, I make the best oatmeal\nraisin cookies in the world. (Phoebe opens a tin and offers Rachel a cookie)"
Rachel	 (taking cookie) Ok, thanks Pheebs (takes bite of cookie,\noverwhelmed) Oh my God, why have I never tasted these before?!'
Phoebe	 Oh, I don't make them a lot because I don't think it's fair to the other\ncookies"
Rachel	 All right, well, you're right, these are the best oatmeal cookies I've\never had."
Phoebe	 Which proves that I never lie.'
Rachel	 I guess you don't."
Phoebe	 Paolo made a pass at me.'
Chandler	 So, what do you think?'
Ross	 I think It's the most beautiful table I've ever seen."
Chandler	 I know!'
Monica	 So how does this work, you going to balance the plates on these little\nguys' heads?"
Joey	 Who cares, we'll eat at the sink! Come on, let's play!"
Monica	 Heads up Ross! (Monica scores on Chandler and Joey) Score! (points at\nChandler) You suck!'
Phoebe	 Are you okay?'
Rachel	 I need some milk.'
Phoebe	 Ok, I've got milk (takes thermos from her bag and starts to pour a cup)\nHere you go... (Rachel drinks straight from thermos) Oh!(Rachel finishes thermos) Better?"
Rachel	 No...oh, I feel so stupid! Oh, I think about the other\nday with you guys and I was all "Oh, Paolo, he\'s so great, he makes me feel\nso..." Oh, God, I\'m so embarrassed!'
Phoebe	 I'm so embarrassed, I'm the one he hit on!"
Rachel	 Pheebs, if I had never met him this never would have happened!'
Rachel and Phoebe	 I'm so sorry! No I'm sorry! No I'm sorry! No\nI'm sorry! "
Phoebe	 No, wait, oh, what are we sorry about?'
Rachel	 I don't know...right, he's the pig!"
Phoebe	 Such a pig!'
Rachel	 Oh, God, he's such a pig, "
Phoebe	 Oh he's like a..."
Rachel	 He's like a big disgusting... "
Phoebe	 ...like a...'
Rachel	 ...pig...pig man!'
Phoebe	 Yes, good! Ok...'
Rachel	 (voice wavers) Oh, but he was my pig man...how did I not see this?'
Phoebe	 (raises hand) Oh! I know! (Rachel startled) It's because... he's\ngorgeous, and he's charming, and when he looks at you..."
Rachel	 Ok, Ok, Pheebs...'
Phoebe	 The end.'
Rachel	 Oh, God...'
Phoebe	 Should I not have told you?'
Rachel	 No, no, trust, me, it's, it's, it's much better that I know. Uh, I just\nliked it better before it was better..."
Phoebe	 I think she took it pretty well. You know Paolo's over there right now,\nso..."
Monica	 We should get over there and see if she's okay. (switching\nplaces with Ross) Just one...second! Score! (Monica scores, high-fives with Ross) Game!\nCome on. (Monica and Phoebe leave)"
Ross	 (wiping his brow) Ah...ooh! Well, looks like, uh, we kicked your\nbutts.'
Joey	 No-no, she kicked our butts. You could be on the Olympic standing-there\nteam.'
Ross	 Come on, two on one.'
Chandler	 What are you still doing here? She just broke up with the guy, it's\ntime for you to swoop in!"
Ross	 What, now?'
Joey	 Yes, now is when you swoop! You gotta make sure that when Paolo walks out\nof there, the first guy Rachel sees is you, She's gotta know that you're everything he's\nnot! You're like, like the anti-Paolo!"
Chandler	 My Catholic friend is right. She's distraught. You're there for her.\nYou pick up the pieces, and then you usher in the age of Ross! (Ross and Chandler look off\ninto the distance. Joey, wondering what they are looking at, looks in the same direction)"
Paolo	 No, that's cold, that's cold, that's..."
Ross	 (entering) How's it going?"
Monica	 Don\'t stare. Now she just finished throwing his clothes off the balcony,\nnow there\'s just a lot of gesturing and arm-waving, (shows Rachel gesturing with hands in\nfront of her chest), Ok, that is either, "How could you?" or, "Enormous\nbreasts!" Here he comes! '
Phoebe	 Ooh!'
Paolo	 Uh, I am, uh, to say good-bye.'
Phoebe	 Oh, ok bye-bye.'
Monica	 Paolo, I really hate you for what you did to Rachel, (hands him a\nlasagna) but I still have five of these, so heat it at 375 until the cheese bubbles.'
Paolo	 Grazie.'
Ross	 Paolo, I-I just want to tell you and I think I speak for everyone when I\nsay... (shuts door in his face and walks away)'
Phoebe	 Oh, just look at her... (girls move toward Rachel on the balcony)'
Ross	 Oh you guys, I-I really think just one of us should go out there so she's\nnot overwhelmed..."
Monica	 Oh, you're right."
Ross	 (pulls Monica back) ...and I really think it should be me.'
Ross	 Hey.'
Rachel	 Hey.'
Ross	 You all right?'
Rachel	 Ooh, I've been better..."
Ross	 Come here. (he hugs Rachel) Listen, you deserve so much better than\nhim...you know, I mean, you, you, you should be with a guy who knows what he has when he\nhas you.'
Rachel	 Oh, Ross...'
Ross	 What?'
Rachel	 I am so sick of guys. I don't want to look at another guy, I don't want\nto think about another guy, I don't even want to be near another guy. (Ross crosses arms)"
Ross	 Huh.'
Rachel	 Oh Ross, you're so great!"
Ross	 Ohhhh (Hugs her and sighs)'
Monica	 Ooh...hey honey, are you all right?'
Rachel	 Oh...'
Phoebe	 You ok?'
Rachel	 ...medium...hmm...any cookies left?'
Phoebe	 Yep!'
Ross	 See, Rach, uh, see, I don't think that swearing off guys altogether is the\nanswer. I really don't. I think that what you need is to develop a more sophisticated\nscreening process."
Rachel	 No. I just need to be by myself for a while, you know? I just got to\nfigure out what I want'
Ross	 Uh, no, no, see, because not...not all guys are going to be a Paolo.'
Rachel	 No, I know, I know, and I'm sure your little boy is not going to grow up\nto be one."
Ross	 (astonished) What? '
Rachel	 What?'
Ross	 I-I'm, I'm having a boy?"
Rachel	 Uh...no. No, no, in fact, you're not having a boy."
Ross	 Wha-I'm having, I'm having a boy! (babbling) Huh, am I having a boy?"
Girls	 Yes, you're having a boy! (Monica runs over and hugs Ross)"
Ross	 I'm having a boy! Oh, I'm having a boy!"
Chandler	 Wha-'
Joey	 Wha-'
Joey and Chandler	 What is it?'
Ross	 I'm having a boy! I-I'm having a boy!"
Joey	 Hey!'
Chandler	 Hey!'
Joey and Chandler	 We already knew that! (they hug)'
Ross	 I'm having a son. Um..."

Monica	 Yes! And that would be a shut-down!'
Joey and Chandler	 Shut-out!! (They both start heading for\ntheir rooms.)'
Monica	 Where are you guys going? Come on, one more game!'
Joey	 Uh, it's 2
Chandler	 Yeah, get out!'
Monica	 You guys are always hanging out in my apartment! Come on, I'll only use\nmy left hand, huh? Come on, wussies! (Joey and Chandler pick her up) All right, ok, I\ngotta go. I'm going, (they throw her out) and I'm gone."
Chandler	 (to Joey) One more game?'
Joey	 Oh yeah!'
