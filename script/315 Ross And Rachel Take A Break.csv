Joey	 (to Monica) Hey, how much will you give me to eat this whole jar of\nolives?'

Joey	 Done.'
Phoebe	 (entering) Hey. I need an atlas! I need an atlas!'
Monica	 Why? (in a motherlike tone) Do you have a report due?'
Phoebe	 I have a date with this diplomat I met while I was giving free massages\noutside the UN and, I don\xc2\x92t know where his country is.'
Monica	 Okay, let\xc2\x92s start with the free messages outside the UN.'

Phoebe	 Umm, well he\xc2\x92s very dashing, y'know, and umm, very, very\nsophisticated, and he doesn\xc2\x92t speak any English, but according to his translator, he\ntotally gets me."
Monica	 \xc2\x91Kay, here you go. (Hands her this tiny little globe.)'
Phoebe	 What is this?'
Monica	 It\xc2\x92s a globe and, a pencil sharpener.'
Chandler	 (entering) Hey, does anybody need anything copied? I\xc2\x92m going down\nto the Xerox place.'
Monica	 Oh, no thanks.'
Chandler	 Okay listen, just give me anything I can make two of.'
Monica	 Well, if you don\xc2\x92t have anything to copy, why are you going down\nthere?'

Chandler	 Yeah! You wanna come?'
Joey	 Yeah!'

Issac	 (to Chandler and Joey) Can I help you?'
Chandler	 Uh-oh.'
Joey	 Uh, y'know what, we\xc2\x92re having second thoughts about our copying\nneeds. And we\xc2\x92ll need a little more time to think about it."
Issac	 Chloe, switch with me, there\xc2\x92s some guys here that got a crush on\nyou.'
Chandler	 (to Joey) Okay, that hurt us.'
Chloe	 Hi guys. I haven\xc2\x92t seen you since this morning.'

Sergei	 (something in Russian or Polish)'
Mischa	 He\xc2\x92s says, \xc2\x91Walking with you makes this strange city, feel\nlike home.\xc2\x92'
Phoebe	 Me too. Although this city is my home, so. So that\xc2\x92s dumb what I\nsaid, don\xc2\x92t tell him I said that. Umm, you make something up. (Mischa does so and\nSergei kisses her hand.) Nice, (to Mischa) thank you. This is me. Here.'
Mischa	 (leaning in) Your eyes are very pretty.'
Phoebe	 (to Mischa) Thank you, very much! Oh! (to Sergei) Thank you!'
Mischa	 (leaning in) He would like to kiss you.'
Phoebe	 (to Mischa) Okay, y'know what, you don\xc2\x92t have to do that now.\n(Mischa translates that to Sergei) No-no-no-no!! Not him, you don\xc2\x92t! (Mischa tells\nSergei he can proceed and steps away) Well the moment\xc2\x92s over."
Phoebe	 Oh.'
Mischa	 Oy!'
Phoebe	 (pointing to the globe) See there it is right there.'
Monica	 Wow! It\xc2\x92s small.'
Phoebe	 Yeah. But Sergei said it took the Germans six weeks to get all the way\nacross it.'
Monica	 So you had fun, huh?'
Phoebe	 Yeah. Except for, y'know when you\xc2\x92re on a date and you\xc2\x92re\ngetting along really great but the guy\xc2\x92s translator keeps getting in the way."
Monica	 No.'
Ross	 (entering) Hey.'

Monica	 Oh no, she\xc2\x92s still at work, but she told me to tell you to call\nher.'
Ross	 Oh what?! Is she gonna cancel on me again?! How can she do this?\nDoesn\xc2\x92t she know it\xc2\x92s our anniversary?'
Monica	 All right ah, Ross, this is the extent of my knowledge on the subject.\n(holds up a notepad) Call Rachel.'
Ross	 What\xc2\x92s that on the bottom?'
Monica	 Oh that\xc2\x92s my doodle of a ladybug, with a top hat. (to Phoebe)\nShe\xc2\x92s fancy.'
Rachel	 (answering her phone at work) Hello.'
Ross	 Hey, honey.'
Rachel	 Oh, hi.'
Ross	 Hey, what\xc2\x92s going on?'
Rachel	 Well, there was a disaster in shipping and I\xc2\x92ve got to get this\norder in. Honey, I\xc2\x92m so sorry, but it looks like I\xc2\x92m gonna be here all night.'
Ross	 What, do you, well umm, oh how about I come up there?'
Rachel	 No-no-no, no, honey please, I\xc2\x92ve got, I\xc2\x92ve just have so much\nto deal with.'
Phoebe	 (to Monica) Anyway, I\xc2\x92m going out with Sergei again tonight, and\num, could you come and be the translator\xc2\x92s date? So that when we, it\xc2\x92s time for\nour alone time, you two could split off. Y'know, he\xc2\x92s really, he\xc2\x92s kinda cute."
Monica	 Yeah, well kinda cute, like really kinda cute, or kinda cute like your\nfriend Spackel Back Larry?'
Phoebe	 Hey, don\xc2\x92t call him that! His name is Spackel Back Harry!'
Chandler	 Hey, y'know what, maybe we should get going. I mean what time did\nChloe say we should be there?"

Joey	 4
Chandler	 Yeah all right, so we\xc2\x92ll hang out.'
Joey	 Yeah. Hey, remember when she brought up that thing about the three of us?'
Chandler	 Yes. Vividly.'
Joey	 She was kidding about that right?'
Chandler	 Yeah, I-I-I think so. (Pauses and thinks about it for a second) Yeah,\nI-I think so...'
Joey	 God, that would be weird it that situation presented itself tonight, huh?'
Chandler	 Yeah. Yeah, I mean what, what would we do?'
Joey	 Dude, I don\xc2\x92t know.'
Chandler	 She was kidding.'
Joey	 Yeah.'
Chandler	 She was.... But y'know what, just in case, maybe we should come up\nwith a set of ground rules."
Joey	 Yeah, for sure. Okay. Probably want the first thing to be, never open your\neyes. Y'know, because you don\xc2\x92t want to be doing something and then look up and see\nsomething you don\xc2\x92t want to be seeing."
Chandler	 Yeah. Good call, nice one. Hold it!! Hold it! What if me eyes are\nclosed, and, and my hand is out there.... (holds his arm out and pretends to grab\nsomething with his hand.)'
Joey	 Ah!! Okay! Eyes open at all times! Oh, hey, how do we decide where we...\n(clears throat) y'know each would, (clears throat again) y'know (pause) be?"
Chandler	 Right. Right. Well ah, y'know we could flip for it."
Joey	 Yeah, I guess, but what\xc2\x92s like heads and what\xc2\x92s tails?'
Chandler	 Well it you don\xc2\x92t know that, then I don\xc2\x92t want to do this\nwith you.'
Rachel	 (on the phone) No, no, no, I\xc2\x92m looking at a purchase order right\nhere and it clearly states that we ordered the Rivera bikini in a variety of sizes and\ncolours. And.... (listens) What does it matter, what I\xc2\x92m wearing?! Can I please speak\nto your supervisor? (listens) Thank you. (to Sophie) We\xc2\x92re holding.'
Ross	 (entering, carrying a basket) Hi!'
Rachel	 (startled) Oh!! My God, what are you doing here?'
Ross	 Well you said you couldn\xc2\x92t go out so.... (pulls the cover off of the\nbasket)'
Sophie	 You brought a picnic, oh, what a boyfriend. That\xc2\x92s it, on Monday I\nstart wearing make-up.'
Rachel	 Ross honey, this is very nice, but, but I-I got a crisis.'
Ross	 Yeah, but I got cous-cous!'
Rachel	 Honey, honey, I\xc2\x92m sorry, I know it\xc2\x92s our anniversary but I\ntold you on the phone I don\xc2\x92t have time to stop.'
Ross	 Okay, you don\xc2\x92t have to stop, I\xc2\x92m invisible, I\xc2\x92m not here.\n(lights a candle)'
Rachel	 But I don\xc2\x92t, hmm... (on phone) Oh, who approved that order?!\n(listens) Well there is no Mark Robbinson in this office. (to Sophie) Get me Mark on the\nphone!'
Sophie	 I love Mark. (to Ross) Do you know Mark?'
Ross	 Yeah!!'
Rachel	 Well, let me just check that with what I got here, all right see 038 is\nnot the number for (Ross starts making a lot of noise with a handheld pepper grinder) this\nstore, 038 is Atlanta. And I...(stops and looks at Ross)'
Ross	 (stopping grinding) Pepper?'
Rachel	 (angrily) None for me.'
Ross	 Okay sorry, whew.'
Rachel	 I\xc2\x92m sorry, as I was saying the store number is wrong, and I\xc2\x92m\nsorry but that\xc2\x92s... (notices a fire that Ross\xc2\x92s candle has started) Oh my God!! '
Ross	 (putting out the fire with a squeeze bottle of water) Okay, that\xc2\x92s a\nfire. Oh yeah. Oh yeah.'
Rachel	 (on phone) Excuse me, I\xc2\x92m sorry, I\xc2\x92m gonna have to call you\nback, I\xc2\x92ve got a Schemp in my office. (hangs up) (to Ross) What are you doing?'
Ross	 I\xc2\x92m sorry. But ah, hey, oh, somebody\xc2\x92s off the phone, how\n\xc2\x91bout a glass of wine by the fire, I could get it going again.'
Rachel	 Ross you\xc2\x92re not listening to me, I don\xc2\x92t have time to stop.'
Ross	 Come on Rach, you don\xc2\x92t have what, ten minutes?'
Rachel	 I don\xc2\x92t have ten minutes!!'
Ross	 What? (to Sophie) Sophie, does she have ten minutes?'
Rachel	 Hey, Ross!!! I told you I don\xc2\x92t!'
Ross	 Don\xc2\x92t yell at me okay, this is the most I\xc2\x92ve seen you all week.'
Rachel	 Look, I cannot do this right now, okay, I\xc2\x92ve got a deadline, would\nyou just go home, I\xc2\x92ll talk to you later. (storms out) '
Ross	 Yeah, but wait...'
Rachel	 Good bye!'
Sophie	 Actually, that\xc2\x92s our three hole punch.'
Ross	 Hey.'
Rachel	 Hi. Look um, about what happened earlier...'
Ross	 No, hey, well, I-I completely understand. You were, you were stressed.'
Rachel	 (throws her stuff down) I was gonna give you a chance to apologise to\nme.'
Ross	 For what? For letting you throw me out of your office?'
Rachel	 You had no right coming down to my office Ross. You do not bring\na picnic basket to somebody\xc2\x92s work! Unless maybe they were a park ranger!'
Ross	 Yeah, well excuse me for wanting to be with my girlfriend on our\nanniversary, boy what an ass am I. '
Rachel	 But I told you, I didn\xc2\x92t have the time!'
Ross	 Yeah, well you never have the time. I mean, I don\xc2\x92t feel like I even\nhave a girlfriend anymore, Rachel.'
Rachel	 Wh, Ross what do you want from me? You want me, you want me to quit my\njob so you can feel like you have a girlfriend?'
Ross	 No, but it\xc2\x92d be nice if you realised, it\xc2\x92s just a job!'
Rachel	 Just a job!'
Ross	 Yes.'
Rachel	 Ross do you realise this is the first time in my life I\xc2\x92m doing\nsomething I actually care about. This is the first time in my life I\xc2\x92m doing\nsomething that I\xc2\x92m actually good at. I mean. if you don\xc2\x92t get that...'
Ross	 No, hey, I get that, okay, I get that big time. And I\xc2\x92m happy for ya,\nbut I\xc2\x92m tired of having a relationship with your answering machine! Okay, I\ndon\xc2\x92t know what to do anymore.'
Rachel	 Well neither do I!'
Ross	 Is this about Mark?'
Rachel	 (shocked) Oh my God.'
Ross	 Okay, it\xc2\x92s not, it\xc2\x92s not.'
Rachel	 Oh my God. I cannot keep having this same fight over and over again,\nRoss, no, you\xc2\x92re, you\xc2\x92re, you\xc2\x92re making this too hard.'
Ross	 Oh I\xc2\x92m, I\xc2\x92m making this too hard. Okay, what do you want me to\ndo.'
Rachel	 I don\xc2\x92t know, I don\xc2\x92t know. Urrrgh! Look, maybe we should take\na break.'
Ross	 Okay, okay, fine, you\xc2\x92re right. Let\xc2\x92s ah, let\xc2\x92s take a\nbreak, (goes to the door) let\xc2\x92s cool off, okay, let\xc2\x92s get some frozen yogart, or\nsomething.. (opens the door)'
Rachel	 No. (Ross is standing in the doorway.) A break from us.'

Chloe	 And the advances in collating in the past five years, I mean we just got\nin an X-5000, y'know. The X-5000 makes the X-50 look like a T-71. "
Chloe	 (seeing Ross enter) Hey, it\xc2\x92s the dinosaur guy. (runs over to Ross)\nHi, Ross.'
Ross	 Oh, hi Chloe.'
Chloe	 I want you to met some friends of mine. (Introduces him to Chandler and\nJoey) This guy is my hero, he comes in with some stuff he wants it blown up 400%, we said\nwe don\xc2\x92t do that, and he says you gotta. And y'know what, we did it. And now anytime\nanybody wants 400, we just say \xc2\x91let\xc2\x92s Ross it!\xc2\x92"
Chandler	 And that\xc2\x92s the only colour that comes in.'
Issac	 Yo, Chloe, do you have a quarter for the condom machine?'
Chloe	 Oh! (storms off)'
Chandler	 So, what are you doing here? I thought tonight was your big\nanniversary dinner.'
Ross	 Yeah, little change in plans. Ahh, we\xc2\x92re gonna break-up instead.'
Monica	 Oh, and I can also speak a little French. Voulez-vous coucher avec moi\nce soir? (Mischa laughs) Why? What did I say?'
Mischa	 Well, you just asked if I wanted to go to bed with you tonight.'
Monica	 Oh my God! No wonder I get such great service at Cafe Maurice.'
Phoebe	 (laughing and banging her spoon on the table) Knock, knock, knock,\nknock, hi. Um, could you please tell Sergei that um, I was fascinated by what Boutros\nBoutros Gali said in the New York Times.'
Phoebe	 You didn\xc2\x92t say Boutros Boutros Gali.'
Mischa	 (to Sergei) Boutros Boutros Gali.'
Mischa	 He says he was too.'
Phoebe	 Interesting.'
Mischa	 (to Monica) So I was wondering....'
Phoebe	 Okay, ah, before you get all talky again, umm, could you also please\ntell Sergei that I really like his suit.'
Mischa	 (to Phoebe, very quickly) Eh, he said, thank you very much, he thinks\nyou look very pretty tonight, your hair, golden like the sun. (to Monica) So you're a\nchef?"
Monica	 I\xc2\x92m also thinking about opening up my own restaurant.'
Mischa	 Oh, really.'
Phoebe	 Monica, can I talk to you behind my menu, please. (Behind the menu) What\nare you doing?'
Monica	 Well, I was having a conversation.'
Phoebe	 Yeah but, Mischa is so interested in you, that Sergei and I haven\xc2\x92t\nbeen able to say two words to each other.'
Monica	 What do you want me to do? Just sit here silently while you three have a\nconversation?'
Phoebe	 That would be great. Thank you.'
Rachel	 (jumping up to answer the phone) Hello!'
Mark	 Oh, hi. It\xc2\x92s Mark.'
Rachel	 (disappointed) Oh.'
Mark	 What? Is it my breath?'
Rachel	 No! Sorry, I just thought you were somebody else. Hi!'
Mark	 Hi. Well, look, I was just gonna leave a message, isn\xc2\x92t tonight your,\nyour big anniversary dinner?'
Rachel	 Yeah. Well, umm.....'
Mark	 Rach, are you okay?'
Rachel	 (on the verge of tears) Yeah, I\xc2\x92m fine.'
Mark	 You wanna talk, I mean I can come over?'
Rachel	 No! Really, no, please, please, that\xc2\x92s, that\xc2\x92s okay.'
Mark	 All right, all right, I\xc2\x92m coming over, and I\xc2\x92m bringing Chinese\nfood.'
Rachel	 Oh, yeah, I\xc2\x92m not, I\xc2\x92m not hungry.'
Mark	 It\xc2\x92s for me.'
Rachel	 Oh. Okay, bye.'
Joey	 So what are you gonna do?'
Ross	 What can I do? One person wants to break-up, you break-up.'
Chandler	 Hey, no way! Come on, this is you guys, call her and work it out.'
Ross	 Oh come on, we just had this huge fight, all right, don\xc2\x92t I have to\nwait a while?'
Chandler	 Hey, this isn\xc2\x92t like swimming after you eat, pick up the phone!!'
Chandler	 Y'know that whole swimming thing is a myth."
Joey	 Yeah, tell that to my Uncle Lenny.'
Chandler	 Why? What happened to him?'
Joey	 Nothing, he\xc2\x92s just really believes in that.'
Rachel	 Oh, and then, we got into this big, stupid fight. I just, it was awful.\nI told him he treats me like a park ranger, or something, oh and then I told him I wanted\nto take a break, I don\xc2\x92t want to take a break.'
Mark	 Wow. I\xc2\x92m sorry. Eggroll?'
Rachel	 No. (grabs an eggroll) And then I called him, and he wasn\xc2\x92t there.'
Mark	 Well, then he\xc2\x92s, he\xc2\x92s probably just, out.'
Rachel	 Oh, thank you that\xc2\x92s very helpful, I\xc2\x92m glad you came over.'
Rachel	 Hello.'
Ross	 Hi! It\xc2\x92s me.'
Rachel	 Hi! Oh, I\xc2\x92m so glad you called.'
Ross	 Really? I\xc2\x92ve been thinking, this is crazy, I mean don\xc2\x92t,\ndon\xc2\x92t you think we can work on this? '
Mark	 Hey, what do you want to drink?'
Ross	 Who\xc2\x92s that?'
Rachel	 Nobody.'
Mark	 Is it okay if I finish the apple juice?'
Ross	 Is that Mark?'
Rachel	 Umm, honey, look he just came over to....'
Ross	 Yeah! Got it! (slams the phone down, and walks back to the bar.)'
Chloe	 Hey, dinosaur guy, look at you, so sad. Come dance.'
Ross	 Ah, that\xc2\x92s okay, thanks.'
Chloe	 Hey, you don\xc2\x92t have to smile. You just have to dance.'
Ross	 Look, I don\xc2\x92t feel like dancing, I feel like having a drink. Okay?'
Chloe	 Oh, okay. (to the bartender) Hey, two beers. (sits down next to him) '
Mischa	 (to Monica) And the vet said it was time. And so from half a world away,\nwhile my Mother held the phone to his ear, I said good bye to my dog,. In seven languages.'
Monica	 Oh. (to Phoebe) Can I have a tissue?'
Phoebe	 Oh, yeah, sure. I just hope you, hope you don\xc2\x92t accidentally suck\nit up through your nose and choke on it.'
Mischa	 (to Phoebe) Sergei, would like to apologise for my behaviour tonight.'
Phoebe	 Well, tell him, apology accepted.'
Mischa	 (to Monica) Oh, he\xc2\x92s unbelievable. I mean for the first time in\nthree years somebody wants to actually want to talk to me, but do you think he would let\nme enjoy that, no!! (to Sergei) You silly diplomat, why don\xc2\x92t you learn some English,\nSergei?'
Phoebe	 Excuse me, but umm, isn\xc2\x92t he paying for your dinner?'
Monica	 Hey, the man\xc2\x92s dog just died.'
Mischa	 (to Monica) I have just resigned my post. Would you care to accompany me\nto the Rainbow Room? I have diplomatic coupons.'
Monica	 It will be my pleasure. (to Phoebe) My guy has diplomatic coupons. Your\nguy can\xc2\x92t even say coupons. (they leave)'
Sergei	 Uh, (picks up a plate) plate?'
Phoebe	 Plate! Yes, plate.'
Sergei	 Plate. Plate. Plate.'
Phoebe	 See, we don\xc2\x92t need them.'
Sergei	 (picking up a cup) Plate?'
Phoebe	 Yeah.'
Ross	 (to Chloe) I like this song.'
Chloe	 Well, you\xc2\x92re practically dancing already. Why don\xc2\x92t you just do\nit over here?'
Ross	 Oh, no, no.'
Chloe	 What? Are you married? \xc2\x91Cause that\xc2\x92s okay.'
Rachel	 (picks up the phone and calls Ross) Oh, be home, be home, be home, be\nhome, be home, be home. Be home. Be home, be home, be home. Oh, you\xc2\x92re not home.'
Chloe	 Still no smile?'


Sergei	 (singing) Touchet, touchet, Miss Americccan pie. (stops to correct\nPhoebe) Ameri-ccan.'
Phoebe	 Ameri-can.'
Sergei	 Ameri-ccan.'
Phoebe	 Ameri-can. Y'know it\xc2\x92s a very hard language. Let\xc2\x92s do\nit again."
