Monica	 Do you realize that four weeks from today we\xc2\x92re getting married?\nFour weeks baby!! Four weeks!!!'
Chandler	 Do you realize you get louder each week?'
Monica	 There\xc2\x92s still so much to do. Have you written your vows yet?'
Chandler	 I figured I\xc2\x92d buy those. Pat, I\xc2\x92d like to buy a vow.\n(Laughs)'
Monica	 Sweetie, you know I have no sense of humor when it comes to the wedding.'
Chandler	 Right. So uh, have you written yours yet?'
Monica	 No! But I know exactly what I\xc2\x92m going to say.'
Chandler	 Do you happen to know what I\xc2\x92m going to say?'
Monica	 (handing him a pad of paper and a pen) Let\xc2\x92s just do it right now.\nOkay? It won\xc2\x92t be hard. Just say what\xc2\x92s in your heart. (She goes back, sits\ndown, and starts feverishly writing.)'
Chandler	 (watching in her) (in his head) Look at her go! She must love me\nmore than I love her! What\xc2\x92s wrong with me? Ooh, don\xc2\x92t open that door.'

Chandler	 (writing) Monica, there are no words\xc2\x85 (To Joey and Ross) There\nare no words! This should not be this hard!'
Joey	 All right, uh\xc2\x85 (To Ross) Oh hey, you\xc2\x92ve done this before Ross,\nwell what did you say when you made up your vows?'
Ross	 Well with Carol, I promised never to love another woman until the day I\ndie. She made no such promise.'
Chandler	 I\xc2\x92m so pathetic! Monica knows what she wants to say! You\nshould\xc2\x92ve seen her. Writing, writing, writing!'
Rachel	 Monica what? '
Phoebe	 What?!'
Rachel	 What is the emergency?!'
Monica	 You have to help me! I\xc2\x92m supposed to be writing my vows and all I\nhave is this! (Shows them what she\xc2\x92s been working on.)'
Rachel	 Well, I like the pretty little drawing of you in the wedding dress.'
Monica	 Thank you.'
Phoebe	 Yeah, except your breasts look kinda small. (Points.)'
Monica	 Those are my eyes! Those are my breasts. (Points.)'
Phoebe	 Oh! Yeah! (Monica glares at her.)'
Ross	 Well, why don\xc2\x92t you just start with something simple. Like umm,\nMonica from the moment I met you, I knew I loved you.'
Chandler	 Yeah, I\xc2\x92m not sure I can do that.'
Ross	 ...everyone, this is Chandler!'
Fat Monica	 Hi, I'm Ross's little sister."
Chandler	 (seeing her) Okay.'
Rachel	 Okay. Okay. Okay. Umm, maybe you can start with, "Chandler, even\nthough we were friends; there was a part of me that always knew I wanted more."'
Chandler	 All right, there\xc2\x92s a nuclear holocaust, I\xc2\x92m the last man on\nEarth. Would you go out with me?'
Monica	 Ennnh.'
Monica	 Ooh, are we allowed to lie in the vows?!'
Phoebe	 Well maybe you don\xc2\x92t talk about your feelings back then. Maybe you\njust say something about y\xc2\x92know all the things that he\xc2\x92s taught you. Like\xc2\x85\n(They all try to think about one example and don\xc2\x92t succeed.) Or all the things you\ntaught him.'
Monica	 Now everybody knows the basic erogenous zones. (She starts labelling\nthem) You got one, two three, four (Chandler is shocked to find out there\xc2\x92s more than\nthree), five, six, and seven!'
Chandler	 (shocked) There are seven?! (Points to one) That\xc2\x92s one?'
Monica	 It\xc2\x92s kind of an important one!'
Chandler	 Oh, y\xc2\x92know-y\xc2\x92know what, I was looking at it upside down.'
Rachel	 Well, y\xc2\x92know, sometimes that helps. (She realises what that\ncould\xc2\x92ve meant.)'
Monica	 All right. Umm, you could uh start out with a little 1, a 2, a 1-2-3, 3,\n5, a 4, a 3-2, 2, a 2-4-6, 2-4-6, 4, (Rachel starts getting worked up) 2, 2, 4-7, 5-7,\n6-7, 7 \xc2\x857..\xc2\x857\xc2\x857-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7\xc2\x85(mouths 7)! (They both lean back\non the couch satisfied.)'
Joey	 Oh, I got it! How about saying something like, "Monica\xc2\x85'
Chandler	 (writing) Monica\xc2\x85'
Joey	 "\xc2\x85when I look back over our time together\xc2\x85"'
Chandler	 (writes what Joey said and waits for him to go on) Yeah?'
Joey	 Well, I can\xc2\x92t do everything! Look back over your time together.'
Phoebe	 Oh, look, twins. Hi, guys. Oh, cute, cute.'
Monica	 No fair. I don't even have one. How come they get two?"
Chandler	 You'll get one."
Monica	 Oh yeah? When?'
Chandler	 All right. I'll tell you what. When we're 40, if neither one of us are\nmarried, what do you say you and I get together and have one?"
Monica	 Why won't I be married when I'm 40?"
Chandler	 Oh, no, no. I just meant hypothetically.'
Monica	 Ok, hypothetically, why won't I be married when I'm 40?"
Chandler	 No, no, no.'
Monica	 What is it? Is there something fundamentally unmarriable about me?'
Chandler	 (trapped) Uh, uh.'
Monica	 Well?'
Chandler	 Dear God! This parachute is a knapsack! (throws himself over the back\nof the chair he was sitting in)'
Chandler	 Nice try.'
Monica	 Wait, wait, wait! (She puts a Shriner's hat on the turkey.)"
Chandler	 Look, Monica\xc2\x85'
Monica	 Look! (She puts a big, yellow pair of sunglasses on the bird.)'
Chandler	 This is not going to work.'
Monica	 I bet this will work! (She starts dancing and Chandler cracks up.)'
Chandler	 You are so great! I love you!'
Monica	 What?'
Chandler	 Nothing! I said, I said "You\'re so great" and then I just, I\njust stopped talking!'
Monica	 You said you loved me! I can't believe this!"
Chandler	 No I didn't!"
Monica	 Yes, you did!'
Chandler	 No I didn't!"
Monica	 You love me!'
Chandler	 No I don't! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!"
Chandler	\xc2\xa0 Y\xc2\x92know I was thinking, what if I uh, unpack here?'
Monica	 Then all your stuff would be here.'
Chandler	 Well, what if all my stuff was here?'
Monica	 Then you\xc2\x92d be going back and forth all the time, I mean it\ndoesn\xc2\x92t make any sense.'
Chandler	 Okay. What if we lived together and you understand what I\xc2\x92m\nsaying?'
Monica	 You wanted it to be a surprise.'
Chandler	 Oh my God.'
Monica	 Chandler\xc2\x85 In all my life\xc2\x85 I never thought I would be so lucky.\n(Starting to cry.) As to\xc2\x85fall in love with my best\xc2\x85my best\xc2\x85 There\xc2\x92s a\nreason why girls don\xc2\x92t do this!'
Chandler	 Okay! (He joins her on one knee) Okay! Okay! I'll do it!\xc2\xa0 Oh God,\nI thought\xc2\x85 (Starting to cry, pauses) Wait a minute, I-I can do this. (Pause) I\nthought that it mattered what I said or where I said it. Then I realized the only thing\nthat matters is that you, (Pause) you make me happier than I ever thought I could be.\n(Starting to cry again.) And if you\xc2\x92ll let me, I will spend the rest of my life\ntrying to make you feel the same way. (Pause as he gets out the ring.) Monica, will you\nmarry me?"
Monica	 Yes.'
Joey	 (yelling through the door) Can we come it yet?! We\xc2\x92re dying out here!'
Monica	 Come in! Come in! (Joey, Rachel, and Phoebe burst through the door.)\nWe\xc2\x92re engaged!!!'

Joey	 Hey!'
Ross	 Hey!'
Rachel	 Hey!'
Phoebe	 Hey!'
Rachel	 Hey, what have you guys been up to?'
Ross	 Oh, we were helping Chandler write his vows, but he kicked us out because\nJoey kept making inappropriate suggestions.'
Joey	 How is "Monica, I love your sweet ass," inappropriate?'
Ross	 How\xc2\x92s Monica coming along with her vows?'
Phoebe	 Well let\xc2\x92s just say its she\xc2\x92s lucky she has a sweet ass,\n\xc2\x91cause she\xc2\x92s not so good at the writing.'
Ross	 I can\xc2\x92t believe in four weeks they\xc2\x92re gonna be married!'
Phoebe	 Well let\xc2\x92s just hope it works. Y\xc2\x92know nine out of ten\nmarriages end in divorce?'
Ross	 Phoebe that\xc2\x92s not true.'
Phoebe	 Yeah, you\xc2\x92re right. How\xc2\x92s the Mrs.?'
Rachel	 I can\xc2\x92t believe they\xc2\x92ve been together for three years.'
Joey	 (shocked) Has it been that long?!'
Ross	 Believe me, it seems like less because they hid it from us for so long.'
Joey	 Hey, it's me! I'm comin' in!"
Chandler	 I've had a very long, hard day."
Joey	 Ahh, I'm gonna go get some chicken. Want some?"
Chandler	 Ahh, no thanks. No chicken, bye-bye then.'
Joey	 Okay.'
Chandler	 Are you okay? I'm so sorry, he wouldn't leave. He kept asking me about\nchicken."
Monica	 Chicken? I could eat some chicken.'
Chandler	 Hey Joe!'
Chandler	 Yeah, can I get a 3-piece, some cole slaw, some beans, and a Coke\xc2\x97(Yelps\nin pain as Monica grabs him underwater)\xc2\x97Diet Coke.'
Rachel	 I don\xc2\x92t know why they didn\xc2\x92t just tell us.'
Joey	 I know! I mean it\xc2\x92s not like we weren\xc2\x92t cool about it.'
Joey	 (To Chandler) You?! (To Monica) And-and you?!'
Monica	 Yes, but you cannot tell anyone! No one knows!'
Joey	 How?! When?!'
Chandler	 It happened in London.'
Joey	 IN LONDON!!!'
Chandler	 The reason we didn't tell anyone was because we didn't want to make a\nbig deal out of it."
Joey	 But it is a big deal!! I have to tell someone! '
Chandler	 No-no-no-no-no! You can't!"
Monica	 Please? Please?! We just don't want to deal with telling everyone, okay?\nJust promise you won't tell."
Joey	 All right! Man, this is unbelievable!'
Monica	 (on phone) I can't wait to be with you!\xc2\xa0 I'll just tell Rachel I'm\ngonna be doing laundry for a couple of hours."
Chandler	 (on phone) Laundry. Huh. Is that my new nickname? (Rachel is\nabsolutely stunned, she opens her mouth in absolute amazement.)'
Monica	 (on phone) Awww, y'know what your nickname is, Mr. Big\xc2\x85"
Rachel	 Arghh!! (She quickly hangs up the phone and starts to pace around\nwondering what to do.)'
Phoebe	 (looking out the window) Oh, look! There's Monica and Chandler! (Starts\nyelling.) Hey! Hey, you guys! Hey! (Chandler and Monica start taking each other's clothes\noff.) Ohh!! Ohh! Ahh-ahhh!!"
Rachel	 What?!'
Phoebe	 (screaming) Ahhh!! Chandler and Monica!! Chandler and Monica!!'
Rachel	 Oh my God!'
Phoebe	 CHANDLER AND MONICA!!!!'
Rachel	 OH MY GOD!!!'
Phoebe	 OH!! MY EYES!!! MY EYES!!!!'
Rachel	 Phoebe!! Phoebe!! It's okay!! It's okay!!"
Phoebe	 NO! THEY'RE DOING IT!!!"
Rachel	 I KNOW!! I KNOW!! I KNOW!'
Phoebe	 YOU KNOW?!!!'
Rachel	 Yes, I know! And Joey knows! But Ross doesn't know so you have to stop\nscreaming!!"
Ross	 (entering) What's going on?"
Phoebe and Rachel	 Ohhh!!!'
Rachel	 (trying to divert his attention from the window by jumping up and down)\nHI!! Hi! '
Ross	 What?! What?!'
Rachel	 Nothing! Oh God, we're just so excited that you want to get this\napartment!"
Ross	 Actually, it looks really good. (Turns towards the window and now Phoebe\nstarts jumping to divert his attention.)'
Phoebe	 (Screaming incoherently.) Get in here!!! (Motions to join her and\nRachel.)'
Phoebe	 Okay, so now they know that you know and they don't know that Rachel\nknows?"
Joey	 Yes, but y'know what? It doesn't matter who knows what. Now, enough of us\nknow that we can just tell them that we know! Then all the lying and the secrets would\nfinally be over!"
Phoebe	 Or, we could not tell them we know and have a little fun of our\nown'
Rachel	 All right honey, we'd better go if we wanna catch that movie."
Monica	 Bye!'
All	 Bye!'
Phoebe	 Bye Chandler! (She walks up to him.) (Quietly.) I miss you already. (She\npinches his butt.)'
Chandler	 (after they've left) Okay, did you see that?! With the inappropriate\nand the pinching!!"
Monica	 Actually, I did!'
Chandler	 Okay, so now do you believe that she's attracted to me?"
Monica	 Ohhh, oh my God! Oh my God! She knows about us!'
Chandler	 Phoebe knows about us!'
Joey	 Well I didn't tell them!"
Monica	 Them?! Who's them?"
Joey	 Uhhh, Phoebe and Joey.'
Monica	 Joey!'
Joey	 And Rachel. I would've told you but they made me promise not to tell!"
Monica	 Oh man, they think they are so slick messing with us! But see\nthey don't know that we know that they know! So\xc2\x85"
Chandler	 Ahh yes, the messers become the messies!'
Phoebe	 I'll have to get back to you on that. Okay, bye! (Hangs up.) Oh my God!\nHe wants me to come over and feel his bicep and more!"
Rachel	 Are you kidding?!'
Phoebe	 No!'
Rachel	 I can not believe he would do that to Mon\xc2\x97Whoa! (She stops suddenly\nand slowly turns to point at Joey. Joey is avoiding her eyes.) Joey, do they know that we\nknow?'
Joey	 No.'
Rachel	 Joey!'
Joey	 They know you know.'
Rachel	 Ugh, I knew it! Oh I cannot believe those two!'
Phoebe	 God, they thought they can mess with us! They're trying to mess with\nus?! They don't know that we know they know we know! (Joey just shakes his head.) Joey,\nyou can't say anything!"
Joey	 I couldn't even if I wanted too."
Chandler	 Listen, this is totally getting out of hand! Okay? She wants me to put\nlotion on her! '
Monica	 She's bluffing!"
Chandler	 Look, she's not backing down! She went like this! (He does a little\nmimic of her dance.)"
Phoebe	 He's not backing down. He went to get lotion."
Joey	 (entering the hall) Oh man! Aren't you guys done yet?!"
Rachel	 Joey look, just look at it this way, the sooner Phoebe breaks Chandler\nthe sooner this is all over and out in the open.'
Joey	 Ooh!'
Rachel	 Okay!'
Joey	 I like that! (To Phoebe) Oh, okay! Show him your bra! He's afraid of bras!\nCan't work 'em! (He swiftly rips open the front of Phoebe's dress revealing her bra.)"
Phoebe	 Joey! (Examining the dress.) Wow, you didn\xc2\x92t rip off any buttons.'
Joey	 It's not my first time."
Monica	 You go back out there and you seduce her till she cracks!'
Chandler	 Okay, give me a second! (Pause) Did you clean up in here?'
Monica	 Of course.'
Chandler	 Oh, you're-you're going?"
Phoebe	 Umm, not without you, lover. (She slowly walks over to him and is\nshowcasing her bra.) So, this is my bra.'
Chandler	 (swallowing hard) It's very, very nice. Well, come here. I'm very\nhappy were gonna have all the sex."
Phoebe	 You should be. I'm very bendy. (Pause) I'm gonna kiss you now."
Chandler	 Not if I kiss you first.'
Phoebe	 Ooh.'
Chandler	 Well, I guess there's nothing left for us to do but-but kiss."
Phoebe	 Here it comes. Our first kiss.'
Chandler	 Okay! Okay! Okay! You win! You win!! I can't have sex with ya!"

Joey	\xc2\xa0 So that's it! It's over! Everybody knows!"
Monica	 Well actually, Ross doesn't."

Phoebe	 Y\xc2\x92know, you\xc2\x92re friend\xc2\x92s getting married, it\xc2\x92s gotta\nchange things.'
Rachel	 You really think it would be that different?'
Phoebe	 How could it not be? I mean pretty soon they\xc2\x92re gonna be having\nkids, and then they\xc2\x92re just gonna be hanging out with other couples who have kids.\nAnd then maybe they\xc2\x92re gonna have to leave the city to be near a Volvo\ndealership.'
Rachel	 Well, things change.'
Joey	 I don\xc2\x92t want them to move to a Volvo dealership!'
Ross	 It\xc2\x92ll be okay Joe.'
Joey	 I\xc2\x92m sorry, I just\xc2\x85I like things the way they are.'
Rachel	 Hey, who's this little naked guy?"
Ross	 That little naked guy would be me.'
Rachel	 Aww, look at the little thing.'
Ross	 Yes, yes, fine, that is my penis. Can we be grown-ups now?'
Chandler	 Who are those people?'
Ross	 Got me.'
Monica	 Oh, that's Nana, right there in the middle. (Reads the back) 'Me and the\ngang at Java Joe's'. "
Rachel	 Wow, Monica, you look just like your grandmother. How old was she there?'
Monica	 Let's see, 1939... yeah, 24, 25?"
Ross	 Looks like a fun gang. (They all look at each other and smile)'
Joey	 Ooh, look-look-look-look-look! I got Monica naked!'
Ross	 (looking) Nono, that would be me again.'
Monica	 Hey, you guys!'
Phoebe	 Hey.'
Joey	 Hey.'

Monica	 Oh that\xc2\x92s so sweet.'
Chandler	 So we both finished our vows.'
Phoebe	 Oh!'
Joey	 Hey!'
Rachel	 Oh, can we read them?'
Monica	 Yeah, I don\xc2\x92t hear Chandler\xc2\x92s and he doesn\xc2\x92t hear mine.'
Rachel	 Okay.'
Phoebe	 Okay.'
Phoebe	 (To Monica) Oh, that\xc2\x92s beautiful.'
Joey	 (To Chandler) (laughing) Funny one! That\xc2\x92s good!'
Rachel	 (To Monica) Monica, will-will you marry me?'
Joey	 What? I don\xc2\x92t get it.'
Ross	 (To Chandler) Oh man, this is hilarious.'

Joey	 (starting to cry) I have never known love like this.'
Chandler	 You really like it?'
Ross	 Dude! How-how did you write this?'
Chandler	 I stole Monica\xc2\x92s and changed the name.'
Ross	 You can\xc2\x92t do that!'
Joey	 If he goes first he can!'
