Phoebe	 Oh, Ross, Mon, is it okay if I bring someone to your parent\xc2\x92s\nanniversary party?'
Monica	 Yeah.'
Ross	 Sure. Yeah.'
Joey	 So, who\xc2\x92s the guy?'
Phoebe	 Well, his name is Parker and I met him at the drycleaners.'
Chandler	 Oooh, did he put a little starch in your bloomers? (Sits up) Who said\nthat?'
Phoebe	 Yeah, he\xc2\x92s really great though. He has this incredible zest for\nlife, and he treats me like a queen, except at night when he treats me like the naughty\ngirl I am.'
Monica	 (To Ross) Oh, by the way. Would it be okay if I gave the toast to mom\nand dad this year?'
Ross	 Uh, yeah, you sure you want to after what happened at their 20th?'
Monica	 Yeah, I\xc2\x92d really like to.'
Ross	 Okay, hopefully this time mom won\xc2\x92t boo you.'
Monica	 Yes! Every year Ross makes the toast, and it\xc2\x92s always really\nmoving, and always makes them cry. Well this year I\xc2\x92m going to make them cry.'
Chandler	 And you wonder why Ross is their favorite?'
Monica	 No! Really! Any time Ross makes a toast everyone cries, and hugs him,\nand pats him on the back and they all come up to me and say, "God, your\nbrother." Know what they\xc2\x92ll say this year? "God, you"'
Joey	 Well I can promise you, at least one person will be crying. (Points to\nhimself) I\xc2\x92m an actor, and any actor worth himself can cry on cue. (snaps fingers)'
Monica	 Really you can do that?'
Joey	 Are you kidding me? Watch! (Makes funny faces trying to cry) Well I\ncan\xc2\x92t do it with you guys watching me!'

Chandler	 What are you doing?'
Monica	 Oh I\xc2\x92m working on my toast for the party, or as I like to call it.\nSob fest 2002. Hey check this out. (Hands him a picture.)'
Chandler	 It\xc2\x92s a dog.'
Monica	 It\xc2\x92s a dead dog. That\xc2\x92s Chi-Chi; she died when I was in high\nschool.'
Chandler	 It\xc2\x92s your parents\xc2\x92 anniversary and you\xc2\x92re going to talk\nabout their dead pet?'
Monica	 The good stuff, huh?'
Rachel	 Hi!'
Ross	 Hey!'
Joey	 Hey!'
Monica	 You got a present for my parents. That\xc2\x92s so sweet.'
Joey	 Yeah, yeah, in honor of their 35th wedding anniversary, I had a\nstar named after them. '
Ross	 Aww that is so cool.'
Joey	 And I got them a book on Karma Sutra for the elderly.'
Rachel	 Hey, do you guys have any extra ribbon?'
Chandler	 Yeah, sure. What do you need? We got lace, satin, sateen, raffia,\ngingham, felt, (Pause) and I think my testacles may be in here too.'
Ross	 (picking up Chi-Chi\xc2\x92s picture) Aww! Chi-Chi! Oh, I loved this dog!\nY\xc2\x92know Monica couldn\xc2\x92t get braces because Chi-Chi needed knee surgery.'
Monica	 What?!'
Ross	 You were the 200-pound 11-year-old who rode her!'
Phoebe	 Hey!'
All	 Hi!'
Phoebe	 Everybody, this is Parker, Parker this is\xc2\x85'
Parker	 No, no, no wait! Don\xc2\x92t tell me. Let me guess. (Points as he says\ntheir names) Joey, Monica, Ross, Rachel and, I\xc2\x92m sorry Phoebe didn\xc2\x92t mention\nyou. (Chandler makes a face) Chandler, I\xc2\x92m kidding all ready you\xc2\x92re my favorite!'
Chandler	 Ha!'
Parker	 Why don\xc2\x92t all of you tell me a little about your self?'
Ross	 Ah, actually, I\xc2\x92m sorry we-we probably should get going.'
Parker	 (laughs) Classic Ross. Rachel, Rachel, oh how you glow. May I? (Puts\nhand on her stomach)'
Rachel	 I, uh, think you already are.'
Parker	 Rachel, you have life growing inside you. Is there anything in this\nworld more miraculous than\xc2\x97Oh a picture of a dog! Whose is this?'
Monica	 That\xc2\x92s my old dog. He passed away years ago.'
Parker	 Oh well, at least you were lucky to have him. Bow-wow old friend,\nbow-wow. So where\xc2\x92s the party?'
Monica	 It\xc2\x92s out on the island. It\xc2\x92s in Massapequa. '
Parker	 Maaaassapequa, sounds like a magical place. Tell me about Massapequa, is\nit steep in Native American history? {Transcriber\xc2\x92s Note
Ross	 Well, there is an Arby\xc2\x92s in the shape of a tee-pee.'
Monica	 Okay, I got my note cards. (To Chandler) Do you got the presents? '
Chandler	 Yeah.'
Monica	 And I\xc2\x92ve got the car keys.'
Parker	 We\xc2\x92re driving!?'
Monica	 Yeah.'
Parker	 Aces!'
Ross	 So uh, he seems like a nice guy.'
Rachel	 Yeah, yeah I like him a lot.'
Ross	 Ya wanna hang back and take our own cab?'
Rachel	 Yeah, otherwise I\xc2\x92m not going.'
Mr. and Mrs. Geller	 Hi'
Ross	 Hi! (Kisses his mom.) Hey mom.'
Rachel	 This is such a great party! 35 years. Very impressive, do you guys have\nany pearls of wisdom? '
Mrs. Geller	 Jack?'
Mr. Geller	 Why would you serve food on such a sharp stick? (Looking a\ntoothpick)'
Ross	 That\xc2\x92s a good question, dad. That\xc2\x92s a good question\xc2\x85'
Rachel	 Hmmm\xc2\x85.'
Woman	 (To Ross and Rachel) Congratulations you two!'
Rachel	 Thank you\xc2\x85we\xc2\x92re so excited'
Woman	 And also, congratulations on your wedding.'
Ross	 Wha\xc2\x97What?'
Mrs. Geller	 Can we talk to you for just a y\xc2\x92know\xc2\x85 It\xc2\x92s just a\nlittle thing. Well we think it\xc2\x92s absolutely marvelous that you\xc2\x92re having this\nbaby out of wedlock, some of our friends are less open-minded. Which is why we\xc2\x92ve\ntold them all that you\xc2\x92re married.'
Ross and Rachel	 What?!'
Mrs. Geller	 Thanks for going along with this.'
Ross	 Dad so what we have to pretend that we\xc2\x92re married?'
Mr. Geller	 Son, I had to shave my ears for tonight. You can do this.'
Ross	 Can you believe that?'
Rachel	 Yeah, if you\xc2\x92re going to do the ears, you might as well take a pass\nat the nosal area.'
Ross	 No, us having to lie about being married.'
Rachel	 No, I know I don\xc2\x92t either, but ya know what, it\xc2\x92s their party,\nand it\xc2\x92s just one night. And we don\xc2\x92t even have to lie; we just won\xc2\x92t say\nanything. If it comes up again, we\xc2\x92ll just\xc2\x85smile. We\xc2\x92ll nod along.'
Woman	 Ross!'
Man	 Rachel!'
Ross	 Hi Aunt Lisa, Uncle Dan'
Aunt Lisa	 Congratulations on the baby, and on the wedding'
Ross and Rachel	 Hmmmm\xc2\x85.'
Uncle Dan	 Here\xc2\x92s a little something to get you started. (Hands them a\ncheck)'
Rachel	 Oh\xc2\x85'
Aunt Lisa	 So, how\xc2\x92s married life treating you?'
Rachel	 (looking at the check) Unbelievable!'
Ross	 We love marriage!'
Aunt Lisa	 Great!'
Ross	 Hey'
Phoebe	 Hey!'
Parker	 What a beautiful place. What a great night! I have to tell you, being\nhere with all of you in Event Room C\xc2\x85I feel so lucky. I think of all the good times\nthat have happened here. The birthdays, the proms, the mitzvahs both bar and bat, but none\nof them will compare with tonight! My God, I don\xc2\x92t want to forget this moment!\nIt\xc2\x92s like I want to take a mental picture of you all! Click! (He takes a mental\npicture of them all.)'
Chandler	 I don\xc2\x92t think the flash went off.'
Parker	 Dahaaa! (Punches Chandler in the arm and he makes a face of pain.)\nI\xc2\x92m going to find the men\xc2\x92s room, be right back.'
Phoebe	 I\xc2\x92ll go with you'
Parker	 Come on!'
Chandler	 Somewhere there is someone with a tranquilizer gun and a huge\nbutterfly net looking for that man.'
Joey	 I have to go to the bathroom too, but I don\xc2\x92t want him complimenting\nmy thing.'
Ross	 I\xc2\x92m so we weren\xc2\x92t in the car! Did he ever let up?'
Monica	 He called the Long Island Expressway a concrete miracle.'
Ross	 (imitating Parker) This room! This night! That waiter! His shoes! I must\ntake a mental picture! (He backs into someone.) Ooh sorry\xc2\x85(He looks behind him then\nnotices its Phoebe then stops his impression.)'
Phoebe	 Were you guys making fun of Parker?'
Ross	 That depends, how much did you hear?'
Phoebe	 So, he a little enthusiastic, what\xc2\x92s wrong with that?'
Monica	 It\xc2\x92s just that, it\xc2\x92s so much.'
Phoebe	 Well, so what I like him! Do I make fun of the people you\xc2\x92ve dated?\nTag, Janice, Mona? No, because friends don\xc2\x92t do that. But, do you want my opinion? Do\nyou want it? \xc2\x91Cause in my opinion, your collective dating record reads like the\nwho\xc2\x92s who of human crap. (Walks off)'
Monica	 I feel terrible.'
Joey	 I know'
Ross	 What was wrong with Mona?'

Rachel	 Open it! Open it! Open it!'
Ross	 Yeah baby!'
Man	 So we never got to hear about your wedding!'
Woman	 We were surprise that we weren\xc2\x92t invited.'
Ross	 No, no, it was just our parents and 1 or 2 friends. It was a small\nwedding.'
Rachel	 But it was beautiful. I mean it was small, but kind of spectacular.'
Man	 Where did you have it?'
Rachel	 On a cliff, in Barbados, at sunset, and Stevie Wonder sang Isn\xc2\x92t\nShe Lovely as I walked down the aisle.'
Woman	 Really? '
Rachel	 Yeah, Stevie\xc2\x92s an old family friend. (Hits Ross\xc2\x92s chest)'
Woman	 Oh my God. That sounds amazing. I would love to see pictures.'
Rachel	 So would I. You wouldn\xc2\x92t think that Annie Liebawitz would forget to\nput film in the camera.'
Ross	 Would you excuse us for a second? (Pulls Rachel off to the side)\nUmm\xc2\x85. what are you doing?'
Rachel	 What? I\xc2\x92m not you. This may be the only wedding I ever have. I want\nit to be amazing.'
Ross	 Okay, okay. Ooooh, ooh maybe I rode in on a Harley. '
Rachel	 Okay, Ross, it has to be realistic.'
Parker	 Are you okay? You seem kind of quiet.'
Phoebe	 No, I\xc2\x92m fine. I\xc2\x92m great. I\xc2\x92m with you.'
Parker	 And I\xc2\x92m with you! What a great time to be alive! Look at this\nplate-bouncy thing. (Bounces the plates) What an inspired solution to man\xc2\x92s plate\ndispensing problems. '
Phoebe	 Hm huh, yeah.'
Parker	 Ah! Oysters! Let me feed you one.'
Phoebe	 No, that\xc2\x92s not necessary.'
Parker	 Please.'
Phoebe	 No, actually I don\xc2\x92t eat\xc2\x85'
Parker	 I won\xc2\x92t quit until you try.'
Phoebe	 Okay, fine! Fine! (Takes the oyster and pretends to eat it while\ndropping it on the floor) Mmm\xc2\x85hmmmmm\xc2\x85.'
Parker	 What are they like? I\xc2\x92ve never had one.'
Phoebe	 Why don\xc2\x92t you just try one?'
Parker	 No, they look too weird.'
Chandler	 What are you doin\xc2\x92?'
Monica	 Just going over my toast. Those two will never know what hit \xc2\x91em. I\ncan\xc2\x92t wait. They\xc2\x92re going to be crying so hard. They\xc2\x92re going to be\nfighting for breath. '
Chandler	 Ya know if you want to, I can just hold them down and you could\n(Punches the air).'
Rachel	 And my veil was lace, made by blind, Belgium nuns.'
Woman	 Blind?'
Rachel	 Well, not at first, but it was very intricate work and they said even\nthough they lost their sight, it was all worth it.'
Aunt Lisa	 I\xc2\x92ll bet you looked beautiful\xc2\x85'
Rachel	 Well, I don\xc2\x92t know about that, but some said that I looked like a\nfloating angel.'
Woman	 (To Ross) So, how did you propose?'
Rachel	 Oh yeah. That\xc2\x92s a great story.'
Ross	 Well, um, actually, I-I took her to the planetarium.\nThat\xc2\x92s-that\xc2\x92s where we had our first date. Um, she walked in and I had the room\nfilled with lilies, her favorite flower\xc2\x85'
Aunt Lisa	 Oh that is so sweet!'
Rachel	 Shhh! I want to hear the rest!'
Ross	 Then, Fred Astaire singing The Way You Look Tonight came on the\nsound system, and the lights came down. And I got down on one knee and written across the\ndome in the stars were the words "Will you marry me?"'
Rachel	 And the ring, was the size of my fist (makes a fist)!'
Joey	 Yeah uh, Phoebe! Look umm, I want to apologize about before, okay? We were\nbeing jerks. Parker\xc2\x92s a nice guy and I\xc2\x92d like to get to know him.'
Phoebe	 Then you better do it now.'
Joey	 Why?'
Phoebe	 Because I\xc2\x92m going to kill him'
Joey	 What-what? '
Phoebe	 You guys were right. He\xc2\x92s just too excited about\xc2\x85everything. I\nmean I\xc2\x92m all for living life, but this is the Geller\xc2\x92s 35th\nanniversary. Okay? Let\xc2\x92s call a spade a spade this party stinks.'
Joey	 I know I\xc2\x92m having the worst time. There was a 15-minute line for the\nbuffet, and when I finally got up to the plates, I slipped on a giant booger!'
Phoebe	 Are you sure it wasn\xc2\x92t an oyster?'
Joey	 I guess it could\xc2\x92ve been, I didn\xc2\x92t really look at it.\nY\xc2\x92know, I just wiped it on Chandler\xc2\x92s coat and got the hell out of there.'
Phoebe	 He\xc2\x92s just such a great guy I\xc2\x92m so excited about him.'
Joey	 Oh hey, you should be excited about him. There\xc2\x92s nothing wrong with\nhim he\xc2\x92s a good guy. '
Phoebe	 You think?'
Joey	 Yeah. Ya know what I think; I think we were all just being too negative.'
Phoebe	 You\xc2\x92re right. You\xc2\x92re right, he\xc2\x92s just embracing life. We\ncould all stand to be a little more like Parker. You know what? I am like him! I\xc2\x92m a\nsunny, positive person. '
Joey	 Actually, you have a little bit of an edge.'
Phoebe	 What\xc2\x92s that now?'
Joey	 Nothing\xc2\x85'
Phoebe	 Oh look it\xc2\x92s Parker! '
Parker	 Look! It\xc2\x92s the bunny hop!'
Phoebe	 Oooh I love it!'
Parker	 You do?!'
Phoebe	 Are you kidding? People acting like animals to music. Come on!'
Monica	 Okay it\xc2\x92s time for the toast! Umm now-now, I know that Ross usually\ngives the toast, but this year I\xc2\x92m going to do it.'
Monica	 No, no it\xc2\x92s going to be great. Really! Mom, Dad, when I got\nmarried, one of the things that made me sure I could do it was the amazing example the two\nof you set for me. For that and so many other things I want to say thank you. I know I\nprobably don\xc2\x92t say it enough, but I love you. (Pretends to cry hoping her parents\nwill join her.) When I look around this room, I\xc2\x92m-I\xc2\x92m saddened by the thought of\nthose who could not be here with us. Nana, my beloved grandmother who would so want to be\nhere, but she can\xc2\x92t because she\xc2\x92s dead. As is our dog Chi-Chi. I mean look how\ncute she is. (Holds up the picture and pretends to cry again). Was. (To an old man by the\nstage.) Do me a favor and pass this to my parents. Remember she\xc2\x92s dead. Okay, her and\nNana, gone. Wow! Hey does anybody remember when Debra Winger had to say goodbye to her\nchildren in Terms of Endearment? (Chandler covers his ears) Didn\xc2\x92t see that?\nNo movie fans?! You want to hear something sad? The other day I was watching 60 Minutes\nthese orphans in Romania, who have been so neglected, they were incapable of love. (Waits\nfor people to cry, but doesn\xc2\x92t get any tears.) You people are made of stone!\nHere\xc2\x92s to mom and dad! Whatever!'
Mrs. Geller	 Thank you Monica that was uh, interesting. Wasn\xc2\x92t it\ninteresting, Jack?'
Mr. Geller	 (looking at the picture) Why don\xc2\x92t I remember this dog?'
Mrs. Geller	 Ross, why don\xc2\x92t you give us your toast now?'
Ross	 Oh, no, Mom, it\xc2\x92s just Monica this year.'
Mrs. Geller	 You\xc2\x92re not going to say anything? On our 35th\nwedding anniversary'
Ross	 No, of course, Um\xc2\x85 Um, everybody? Um, I-I just wanted to say\xc2\x85on\nbehalf of my new bride, Rachel (She turns around and smiles), and myself. Umm, that\nif\xc2\x85if in 35 years, we\xc2\x92re half as happy as you guys are, we\xc2\x92ll count\nourselves the luckiest people in the world.'
Mrs. Geller	 (crying) Oh Ross\xc2\x85'
Mr. Geller	 I just wish Nana were alive to hear Ross\xc2\x92s toast.'
Parker	 My God what a fantastically well lit hallway!'
Phoebe	 Can I get you something to drink? Like a water and Valium? '
Parker	 I must say this apartment, its, its, There are no words\xc2\x85'
Phoebe	 Oh thank God. '
Parker	 It\xc2\x92s a haven. A third-floor paradise. A modern-day Eden in the\nmidst\xc2\x85'
Phoebe	 Yeah? I know! I know! Uh huh? Listen why don\xc2\x92t we just um, sit and\nrelax? You know just be with each other. Quietly! '
Parker	 That sounds great. (Sits down) My God this is the most comfortable couch\nI\xc2\x92ve ever sat on in my entire life. (Bounces on couch)'
Phoebe	 Let\xc2\x92s try something else, let\xc2\x92s play a game.'
Parker	 I love games!'
Phoebe	 Shocking! Let\xc2\x92s play the game of who can stay quiet the longest.\n(Giggles)'
Parker	 Or\xc2\x85Jenga.'
Phoebe	 But, let\xc2\x92s play this one first. And remember whoever talks first\nloses! '
Parker	 I lose, now Jenga.'
Phoebe	 Oh my God! Oh my God! '
Parker	 Is something wrong?'
Phoebe	 Wrong? Really? You know the word wrong. Everything isn\xc2\x92t perfect?\nEverything isn\xc2\x92t magical? Everything isn\xc2\x92t a glow with the light of a million\nfairies? They were just brake lights, Parker! '
Parker	 Well, excuse me for putting a good spin on a traffic jam!'
Phoebe	 You don\xc2\x92t have to put a good spin on everything.'
Parker	 I\xc2\x92m sorry that\xc2\x92s who I am. I\xc2\x92m a positive person.'
Phoebe	 No! I am a positive person. You are like Santa Clause on Prozac, at Disneyland,\ngetting laid! '
Parker	 So what do you want me to do, you want me to be more negative, less\nhappy?'
Phoebe	 Much less happy!'
Parker	 Fine! Well then to quote Ross, "I\xc2\x92d better be going." '
Phoebe	 So long! Don\xc2\x92t let the best door in the world hit you in the ass on\nyour way out! (He exits and she slams the door behind him.)'
Parker	 Isn\xc2\x92t this the most incredible fight you\xc2\x92ve ever had in your\nentire life? '
Phoebe	 Uh huh. (Closes door)'
Ross	 \xc2\x85and then, we could\xc2\x92ve gone from the ceremony to the reception\nwith you in the sidecar!'
Rachel	 Ross, it just wouldn\xc2\x92t have been feasible.'
Ross	 But having a dove place the ring on your finger would\xc2\x92ve been no\nproblem?'
Rachel	 It was really fun being married to you tonight. '
Ross	 Yeah! And! And, it was the easiest 400 bucks I\xc2\x92ve ever made.'
Rachel	 Okay Ross, can I uh, can I ask you something?'
Ross	 Yeah.'
Rachel	 That proposal, at the planetarium\xc2\x85'
Ross	 I know, I know it was stupid. '
Rachel	 Are you kidding?! With the, with the lilies, and-and the song, and the\nstars! It was\xc2\x85really wonderful! Did you just make that up? '
Ross	 No, actually I thought about it when, when we were going out. It\xc2\x92s\nhow I imagined I uh, I would ask you to marry me. '
Rachel	 Well, that would\xc2\x92ve been very hard to say no too. '
Ross	 It\xc2\x92s a good thing I didn\xc2\x92t do it, because it sounds like it\nwould\xc2\x92ve been a very expensive wedding. (Rachel laughs) Okay, good night'
Rachel	 Goodnight'
Ross	 Even if the sidecar had a windscreen so your hair wouldn\xc2\x92t get messed\nup? '
Rachel	 I will think about it. '
Ross	 That\xc2\x92s all I\xc2\x92m askin\xc2\x92 '

Monica	 Okay that\xc2\x92s it. I give up. At mom and dad\xc2\x92s 40th\nanniversary, you\xc2\x92re the one giving the speech. '
Ross	 Y\xc2\x92know I don\xc2\x92t understand why they didn\xc2\x92t cry. It was a\nbeautiful speech. '
Monica	 Oh, come on. '
Ross	 Hey! All that stuff you said about true love, you were right, I mean, we\ndid learn a lot from Mom and Dad! And that picture of Chi-Chi with her mischievous grin.\nAnd what you said about Nana. Ohh, yeah she really would\xc2\x92ve wanted to be there. And\nyou know what? I think she was. '
Monica	 (starts to cry) Oh good God, Ross! How the hell do you do it? '
