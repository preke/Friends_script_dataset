Hilda	 What?'
Rachel	 I\xc2\x92ve never interviewed anyone before. I\xc2\x92ve actually never had\nanyone work for me before. Although when I was a kid, we did have a maid, but this\nis-this isn\xc2\x92t the same thing. '

Rachel	 No. Yeah, and I know that. All right, well thank you so much for coming\nin it was nice to meet you.'

Rachel	 Uh-huh, go on.'
Tag	 That\xc2\x92s it. That\xc2\x92s my whole name.'
Rachel	 That\xc2\x92s your whole name, okay of course it is! Okay, well\nlet\xc2\x92s-let\xc2\x92s just have a look-see here. (Looking at his resume)'
Tag	 I know I haven\xc2\x92t worked in an office before, and I really don\xc2\x92t\nhave a lot of experience, but uh\xc2\x85'
Rachel	 Oh come on, what are you talking about? You\xc2\x92ve got three years\npainting houses. Two whole summers at T.G.I. Friday\xc2\x92s, come on!'
Tag	 It\xc2\x92s lame, I know. But I\xc2\x92m a goal-oriented person, very eager to\nlearn\xc2\x85'
Rachel	 Okay, hold on just a second. (She grabs a camera out of the desk and\ntakes his picture.) I\xc2\x92m sorry, it\xc2\x92s for human resources, everybody has to do it.\nCould you just stand up please?'
Chandler	 No-no-no-no. (Waves him away as Monica and Phoebe enter whispering to\neach other.) Hey! (Monica shushes him.)'
Phoebe	 (To Monica) Anyway, I should go. Okay, bye.'
Monica	 (To Chandler) Hey sweetie.'
Chandler	 Hi sweetie. So, what was with all the whispering?'
Monica	 I can\xc2\x92t tell you. It\xc2\x92s a secret.'
Chandler	 Secret? Married people aren\xc2\x92t supposed to have secrets between\none another. We have too much love and respect for one another.'
Monica	 Awww. (Kisses him.) But still no.'
Chandler	 No I\xc2\x92m serious, we should tell each other everything. I do\nnot have any secrets from you.'
Monica	 Really? Okay, so why don\xc2\x92t you tell me what happened to Ross Junior\nyear at Disneyland?'
Chandler	 Oh no-no, I can\xc2\x92t do that.'
Monica	 If you tell me, I\xc2\x92ll tell you what Phoebe said.'
Chandler	 Okay.'
Monica	 Okay.'
Chandler	 So, Ross and I are going to Disneyland and we stop at this\nrestaurant for tacos. And when I say restaurant, I mean a guy, a hibachi, and the trunk of\nhis car. So Ross has about 10 tacos. And anyway, we\xc2\x92re on Space Mountain and\nRoss starts to feel a little iffy.'
Monica	 Oh my God. He threw up?'
Chandler	 No, he visited a little town south of throw up. (Monica laughs\nhysterically.) So what was Phoebe\xc2\x92s secret?'
Monica	 Oh, Nancy Thompson from Phoebe\xc2\x92s old massage place is getting\nfired.'
Chandler	 That\xc2\x92s it?! I gave up my Disneyland story for that?'
Monica	 That\xc2\x92s right! You lose sucker!! (Pause) Please still marry me.'
Rachel	 Chandler, you have an assistant right?'
Chandler	 (angrily) Did she call? You-you told her I was sick right? Always tell\nher I am sick!'
Rachel	 No, I-I just don\xc2\x92t know how you decide who to hire. I mean\nI\xc2\x92ve got it narrowed down to two people. One of them has great references and a lot\nof experience and then there\xc2\x92s this guy\xc2\x85'
Chandler	 What about him?'
Rachel	 I love him. He\xc2\x92s so pretty I wanna cry! I don\xc2\x92t know what to\ndo. Tell me what to do.'
Phoebe	 Come on you know what to do! You hire the first one! You don\xc2\x92t hire\nan assistant because they\xc2\x92re cute, you hire them because they\xc2\x92re qualified.'
Rachel	 Uh-huh. No, I hear what you\xc2\x92re saying and-and-and that makes a lot\nof sense but can I just say one more thing? (Takes out his picture.) Look how pretty!'
Phoebe	 Let\xc2\x92s see. (Looking at the picture) Oh my God! Oh\xc2\x85 But no! No!\nYou can\xc2\x92t-you can\xc2\x92t hire him, because that\xc2\x97it\xc2\x92s not professional. Umm,\nthis is for me (The picture) yes? Thanks. (Puts it in her pocket.)'
Rachel	 Okay you\xc2\x92re right. I\xc2\x92ll hire Hilda tomorrow. Dumb old perfect\nfor the job Hilda!'
Chandler	 Let me see this guy. (Phoebe hands him the picture.) W-H-Wow!\nDon\xc2\x92t show this to Monica! And don\xc2\x92t tell her about the W-H-Wow!'

Terry	 Why would you think that?'

Terry	 Everybody has to audition.'
Joey	 Y\xc2\x92know Terry, I-I don\xc2\x92t really need to do this. I got my\nown cable TV series, (Pause) with a robot.'
Terry	 I\xc2\x92m sorry Joey that\xc2\x92s\xc2\x85that\xc2\x92s the way it is.'
