Rachel	 So, which of this kitchen stuff is mine?'
Monica	 This bottle opener. (She grabs it off of the freezer door.)'
Rachel	 And?'
Monica	 And it\xc2\x92s a magnet!'
Rachel	 Look at that!'
Ross	 How weird is that? Y\xc2\x92know? You\xc2\x92re moving in with me and have the\none thing I don\xc2\x92t have. It\xc2\x92s like uh, in a way you-you complete me\n(Phoebe glares at him) kitchen.'
Rachel	 What?!'
Ross	 (in an Australian accent) You complete me kitchen, matey!'
Phoebe	 Ross, I know what you\xc2\x92re thinking.'
Ross	 What?'
Phoebe	 That she\xc2\x92s gonna move in with you and maybe then she\xc2\x92ll fall\nin love with you and then when she finds out you\xc2\x92re already married, she\xc2\x92ll just\nbe happy. Y\xc2\x92know? You\xc2\x92re just, you\xc2\x92re very sad.'
Ross	 Oh\xc2\x85my\xc2\x85God! I-I see what this is! You are in love with\nRachel!'
Phoebe	 What?!!'
Ross	 Of course! It all adds up! I mean you you\xc2\x92re obsessed with her.\nIt\xc2\x92s always, "Ross, what are you gonna do about Rachel?" "Ross,\nwhy-why are you moving in with Rachel?" "When are you gonna confess your secret\nmarriage to Rachel?" You want her!'
Phoebe	 No! (Ross\xc2\x92s phone rings.)'
Ross	 (answering it) Uh-oh, saved by the bell. (On phone) Hello?'
Monica	 Hey Rach, aren\xc2\x92t these candlesticks (holds up a pair) mine?'
Rachel	 No-no, I bought those.'
Monica	 Ohh! Yeah, I forgot.'
Rachel	 Yeah. (Rachel walks away.)'
Monica	 (under her breath) That you\xc2\x92re a liar. (Hides the candlesticks in a\ndrawer.)'
Ross	 (on phone) No-no-no, that\xc2\x92s great! I\xc2\x92ll be there Monday. And\nthank you again! (Listens) Okay. (Hangs up) (To All) Umm, that was the head of the\nPaleontology department at N uh, Y, uh U!'
Monica	 Wow! Uh what, did he uh, say?'
Ross	 Well remember that paper I had published last year on sediment flow rate,\nhuh? They loved it. '
Rachel	 Well, who wouldn\xc2\x92t?!'
Ross	 I know! Anyway, they asked me to be a guest lecturer! I mean it\xc2\x92s\ntemporary, but uh, if they like me it could lead to a full time job. How great would that\nlook great on a mailbox, huh? "Professor Geller."'
Phoebe	 Yeah, Professor and Mrs.'
Rachel	 And Mrs.?!'
Phoebe	 Oh! Yeah, y\xc2\x92know you and Ross are still married.'
Rachel	 What?!!'
Phoebe	 Just kidding!'
Rachel	 Ohh! Oh God! (Laughs her way into the living room.) '
Phoebe	 (To Ross) Saved your ass.'

Chandler	 Hey!'
Phoebe	 Hi.'
Monica	 Hey!'
Chandler	 Oh, what\xc2\x92s the matter?'
Phoebe	 Well, you know that psychic I see?'
Chandler	 Yeah?'
Phoebe	 Well, she told me that I\xc2\x92m gonna die this week, so I\xc2\x92m kinda\nbummed about that.'
Chandler	 What?!'
Phoebe	 Yeah, and I know you guys don\xc2\x92t know a lot about psychic readings,\nbut that one is pretty much the worse one you can get.'
Monica	 Phoebe that\xc2\x92s crazy!'
Joey	 I can\xc2\x92t believe she would say that too you.'
Rachel	 Yeah honey you don\xc2\x92t believe her do you?'
Phoebe	 I don\xc2\x92t\xc2\x97she said y\xc2\x92know that I\xc2\x92d have triplets! But\nshe also said one of them would be black.'
Chandler	 Just out of curiosity did she tell you how you\xc2\x92re gonna go?'
Phoebe	 No, \xc2\x91cause she didn\xc2\x92t tell me I was gonna die until the very\nend of the session, and I was not gonna waste a whole another hour there! I mean I\xc2\x92ve\nonly got a week left, y\xc2\x92know? I\xc2\x92ve really gotta start living now! (So she\npicks up the latest copy of Car and Driver (a U.S. auto magazine), leans back, and\nstarts reading.)'
Ross	 (entering) Hey everyone!'
Chandler	 Oh hi!'
Ross	 Hey uh, well, today\xc2\x92s my first lecture and I kinda wanted to try it\nout on you guys, do you, do you mind?'
All	 Oh that\xc2\x92d be great. Sure!'
Ross	 (he starts reading directly from his cards word for word very quietly)\n"There are three primary theories concerning sediment flow rate. Each of these\ntheories can be further subcategorized into two distinct\xc2\x85"'
Phoebe	 Oh, this is it. This what\xc2\x92s gonna kill me.'
Ross	 (continuing) "\xc2\x85subcategories. The first of these subcategories\nis\xc2\x85"'
Joey	 (interrupting him) Uh Ross! Are there uh, are there naked chicks on that\npiece of paper?'
Ross	 No! Why?'
Joey	 Well, I\xc2\x92ve just never seen a guy stare so hard at a piece of paper\nthat didn\xc2\x92t have naked chicks on it.'
Ross	 Ohh! Okay! Okay. (Resumes reading word for word from the card) "There\nare three (pauses and looks at Joey) primary theories concerning sediment flow rate.\n(Pauses and darts his eyes between Chandler and Rachel.) (Rachel starts laughing) Each of\nthese theories (glances at Phoebe) can be further subcategorized (glances at Chandler)\ninto\xc2\x85"'
Chandler	 Why don\xc2\x92t you open with a joke?'
Ross	 Open with a joke? It\xc2\x92s a university, not a comedy club!'
Chandler	 Wait a minute, hold the phone! You\xc2\x92re not talking about\nChuckles University?!'
Ross	 (gets up) Okay!'
All	 Ohh! We\xc2\x92re kidding! Oh, we\xc2\x92re kidding!'
Rachel	 Ross, hey you know what might make it less boring?'
Ross	 Thank you!'
Rachel	 Some uh, some visual aides.'
Joey	 Oh-ooh-ooh! Y\xc2\x92know what\xc2\x92s a good visual aide?'
Ross	 Please don\xc2\x92t say naked chicks.'
Joey	 Why not?!'
Ross	 I-I-I don\xc2\x92t even know why I bother to talk to you guys about it.\nY\xc2\x92know what? I\xc2\x92m just gonna do it on my own with no naked chicks.'
Chandler	 That\xc2\x92s the way I did it \xc2\x91til I was 19.'
Chandler	 Hey.'
Joey	 Hey! Any good mail?'
Chandler	 Yes, you got something from the Screen Actor\xc2\x92s Guild.'
Joey	 Ooh, it\xc2\x92s probably a residual check, hey can you open it for me,\nI\xc2\x92m kinda\xc2\x85.'
Chandler	 (opens and reads it) "Benefits lapsed."'
Joey	 Hmm that\xc2\x92s weird. I don\xc2\x92t remember being in a move called\nbenefits lapsed.'
Chandler	 Okay, it\xc2\x92s not a check. They\xc2\x92re saying your health insurance\nexpired because, you didn\xc2\x92t work enough last year.'
Joey	 Let me see that!'
Chandler	 All right.'
Joey	 (reads it) Oh, I can\xc2\x92t believe this! This sucks! When I had insurance\nI could get hit by a bus or catch on fire, y\xc2\x92know? And it wouldn\xc2\x92t matter. Now I\ngotta be careful?!'
Chandler	 I\xc2\x92m sorry man, there\xc2\x92s never a good time to (pauses) stop\ncatching on fire.'
Joey	 All right well, I guess I gotta go get a job. I\xc2\x92m gonna go see my\nagent.'
Chandler	 Okay, make sure you look both ways before you cross the street.'
Joey	 (mocks him, in a whiney voice) \xc2\x85look both ways before you cross the\nstreet. (Turns and walks headlong into the closed door.)'
Phoebe	 Hey!'
Rachel	 Hey Pheebs, you\xc2\x92re still alive! How are you doing?'
Phoebe	 Ugh, it\xc2\x92s so exhausting waiting for death. Ohh, by the way,\ndo you think you could\xc2\x97(Groans, hacks, and then freezes with her eyes open and her\ntongue hanging out.)'
Rachel	 Pheebs, what-what are you doing?'
Phoebe	 I was preparing you for my\xc2\x97didn\xc2\x92t you think I was dead? Did\nthat not come off?'
Rachel	 Oh yeah, scared the hell out of me. I thought we\xc2\x92d lost you\nforever. Pheebs, you lie down?'
Phoebe	 Yeah, thanks. And listen, can you do me a favor? Could you just umm,\nwake me up in a couple hours, y\xc2\x92know if you can.'
Rachel	 Monica!'
Monica	 Hmm? (Rachel holds up the candlesticks.)'
Rachel	 Did-did you take these back?'
Monica	 No-no, I-I just, I liked them so much that I went out and bought some\nfor myself.'
Rachel	 Oh yeah, they\xc2\x92re really great! Aren\xc2\x92t they?'
Monica	 I loved them!'
Rachel	 Yeah. (Monica walks away) Nice try! (Rachel puts them in a box.)'
Ross	 (entering) Hello!'
Monica	 Hey!'
Rachel	 Hey!'
Monica	 How\xc2\x92d the lecture go?'
Ross	 It went great! And I didn\xc2\x92t need any jokes or naked chicks either!'
Rachel	 Wow, that\xc2\x92s great Ross, I\xc2\x92m sorry we weren\xc2\x92t more\nsupportive before.'
Ross	 I knew all I had to do was let the material speak for itself.\nEveryone\xc2\x92s all, "Ross you have to be funny and sexy." Well, I proved them\nwrong! And now, I\xc2\x92m gonna pass the news onto Joey and Chandler.'
Monica	 That you\xc2\x92re not funny or sexy?'
Ross	 That\xc2\x92s right!'
Joey	 (entering) Hey Estelle, listen\xc2\x85'
Estelle	 Well! Well! Well! Joey Tribbiani! So you came back huh? They think\nthey can do better but they all come crawling back to Estelle!'
Joey	 What are you talkin\xc2\x92 about? I never left you! You\xc2\x92ve always been\nmy agent!'
Estelle	 Really?!'
Joey	 Yeah!'
Estelle	 Oh well, no harm, no foul.'
Joey	 Estelle, you gotta get me some work. I-I lost my health insurance.'
Estelle	 All right, first thing we gotta do, damage control.'
Joey	 Why?'
Estelle	 Well, I think uhh, someone out there may have been bad mouthing you all\nover town.'
Joey	 Bastard!'
Chandler	 Hey!'
Joey	 (in obvious pain) Hey! So Estelle lined up a bunch of auditions for me\ntomorrow and I\xc2\x92ll have my health insurance back in no time.'
Chandler	 That\xc2\x92s great, but shouldn\xc2\x92t you be on the toilet right now?'
Joey	 What?!'
Chandler	 What\xc2\x92s wrong with you?'
Joey	 Nothing! Well, I-I got this blinding pain in my stomach when I was lifting\nweights before, then I uh passed out and uh, haven\xc2\x92t been able to stand up since. But\num, I don\xc2\x92t think it\xc2\x92s anything serious.'
Chandler	 This sounds like a hernia. You have to\xc2\x97you-you go to the doctor!'
Joey	 No way! \xc2\x91Kay look, if I have to go to the doctor for anything\nit\xc2\x92s gonna be for this thing sticking out of my stomach! (Rolls over and shows\nChandler.)'
Chandler	 That\xc2\x92s a hernia.'
Joey	 Why did I have to start working out again? (Looks at the weights he was\nusing.) Damn you 15s!'
Rachel	 Well, we\xc2\x92re a little early, the lecture doesn\xc2\x92t end for 15\nminutes.'
Monica	 Yeah, but y\xc2\x92know we could sneak in and watch.'
Rachel	 Yeah, we could. Oh hey look! There\xc2\x92s some Kappa Kappa Deltas! I was\na Kappa. (to them) Hey sisters! (They ignore her.) (To Monica) Wow, we really are bitches.'
Ross	 (to the class) Right! So when Rigby got his samples back from the\nlaboratory he made a startling discovery! What he believed to be igneous, was in fact\nsedimentary. Imagine his consternation when\xc2\x97(sees Monica and Rachel.) Oh bloody hell.'

Monica	 What the hell are you doing?!'
Ross	 Look, I was nervous! You guys had me all worried I was going to be boring!\nI got up there and they were all like staring at me. I opened my mouth and this British\naccent just came out.'
Rachel	 Yeah, and not a very good one.'
Ross	 Will you-will you please?'
The Professor	 Dr. Geller, Kurt Rathman, I\xc2\x92m a professor in the\npaleontology department here.'
Ross	 Oh.'
The Professor	 Do you have a moment to talk about your lecture?'
Ross	 (in his British accent) I\xc2\x92m sorry, I\xc2\x92ve got plans with my\nsister.'
Monica	 (in an Irish accent) Monica Gellerrr. (She rolls her \xc2\x91R\xc2\x92)'
Ross	 (in accent) Right, will you excuse us for one moment? (Takes Monica\naside.) (In his normal voice.) What are you doing?'
Monica	 (normal voice) Oh, you can have an accent and I can\xc2\x92t?! (To an\nexiting student in accent.) Top \xc2\x91O the morning to ya laddies!'
Ross	 Just please stop!'
Rachel	 (in an Indian accent) Yes, yes, Bombay is bery, bery nice time of year.'
Chandler	 Hey, will you grab me a cruller? (Joey starts to groan and get up.)\nSit down! Will you go to the hospital?!'
Joey	 Dude! Hernia operations cost like, a lot probably. Besides it\xc2\x92s\ngetting darker and more painful, that means it\xc2\x92s healing.'
Chandler	 I will loan you the money. Just go to the hospital and let\xc2\x92s just\nget that thing\xc2\x85pushed back in.'
Joey	 Thank you, but it would take me forever to pay you that money back and I\ndon\xc2\x92t want that hanging over my head. Okay? Besides, as soon as my insurance kicks in\nI can get all the free operations I want! Yeah, I\xc2\x92m thinking I\xc2\x92ll probably start\nwith that laser eye surgery too.'
Phoebe	 Hey!'
Chandler	 Hey.'
Joey	 Hey!'
Phoebe	 What\xc2\x92s going on?'
Chandler	 Oh Joey\xc2\x92s got a really bad hernia, but that\xc2\x92s nothing a\nlittle laser eye surgery won\xc2\x92t fix!'
Joey	 Look, I\xc2\x92m telling you if I put my hand on my stomach right here (He\nputs his hand down his pants, like Al Bundy on Married\xc2\x85With Children always\nused to do.) it doesn\xc2\x92t hurt that bad.'
Phoebe	 Hey! Maybe you\xc2\x92ll die!'
Joey	 Sure, now I\xc2\x92m scared.'
Phoebe	 No, we can go together! Just don\xc2\x92t wait too long though, okay?\n\xc2\x91Cause I\xc2\x92m outta here sometime before Friday.'
Joey	 Yeah, but I don\xc2\x92t wanna die!'
Phoebe	 No-no, it\xc2\x92ll be fun! We can come back and we can haunt these guys!'
Monica	 Gimme \xc2\x91em!'
Rachel	 No! They are mine!'
Monica	 You stole them from me!'
Rachel	 You stole them from me!!'
Monica	 Gimme them!'
Monica	 You just wanna each take one?'
Rachel	 Yeah that seems fair. We never use them.'
Ross	 (entering) Look, I really need some help, okay? Why? Why did I have to\nspeak in a British accent?! What do I do?'
Rachel	 Well\xc2\x85'
Monica	 Why don\xc2\x92t you phase it out? Yeah, fade the accent out and people\nwill think you\xc2\x92re, y\xc2\x92know, that you\xc2\x92re adjusting to life in America.'
Rachel	 Yeah, I mean, come on Ross, no one will even notice. I mean they\xc2\x92re\nprobably not even listening!'
Ross	 They\xc2\x92re not listening too me?'
Rachel	 Of course they\xc2\x92re listening to you! Everybody listens to you.'
Ross	 Monica you really think I should try this phasing out thing?'
Monica	 I think you look fine.'
Casting Director #1	 Whenever you\xc2\x92re ready.'
Joey	 (in a gravely, painful voice) Okay. "Hey, Timmy, I\xc2\x92ve got a\nsurprise for you."'
Casting Director #1	 Hold it. I\xc2\x92m sorry, the surprise is a new swing set,\nif you could play it a little less\xc2\x85intense?'
Joey	 Oh yeah, sure, no problem, I\xc2\x92ll just\xc2\x97hold on one second. (He\nturns around and puts his hand in his pants and groans in relief.) (In a relaxed voice.)\n"Hey Timmy, I\xc2\x92ve got a surprise for you!"'
Casting Director #1	 Oh my God!!'
Joey	 So that\xc2\x92s why I feed my dog Purina One! Pick up a bag today!\n(He turns, looks at the bag and realizes he won\xc2\x92t be able to pick it up.)'
Casting Director #2	 That\xc2\x92s where you pick up the bag.'
Joey	 Exactly.'
Casting Director #2	 No, the line is pick a bag, so you need to pick up the bag.'
Joey	 Or, I could just point to it! Huh? Blah, blah, blah, Purina One,\npoint to a bag today. (She just looks at him.) I didn\xc2\x92t get it, did I?'
Casting Director #2	 No.'
Joey	 Yeah, okay. (Leaves)'
Joey	 Hi. I\xc2\x92m Joey Tribbiani; I\xc2\x92m here to audition for (Groans) man.'
Casting Director #3	 You mean dying man?'
Joey	 Yes!'
Monica	 Okay, come on, do it one more time!'
Rachel	 Really? Really?!'
Monica	 Yes!'
Rachel	 Okay! (Picks up the phone and starts dialing.) (In an Irish accent)\n"Hello Ross, this is Dr. McNeeley from the Fake Accent University, we\xc2\x92d like you\nto come on board with us full time! (Hangs up.)'
Phoebe	 (entering) Hey!'
Rachel	 Hey!'
Phoebe	 Listen to this! My reading was wrong, I\xc2\x92m not going die!'
Rachel	 Really?! How do you know?'
Phoebe	 Because my psychic is dead! She must\xc2\x92ve read the cards wrong!'
Rachel	 Oh, I\xc2\x92m sorry.'
Phoebe	 Eh, better her than me! Hey, let\xc2\x92s bake cookies!'
Chandler	 Listen, I\xc2\x92m really glad you got the part.'
Joey	 (barely audible through the pain) Thank you.'
Chandler	 But are you sure you can do this?'
Joey	 Yeah! And hey, thanks for coming with me. And thanks again for helping me\ntake a shower.'
Chandler	 Now, is that never talking about it again?!'
Joey	 (to the director) Hiya!'
The Director	 Hey Joey, we\xc2\x92re ready for ya! (Joey stumbles over) Joey, this\nis Alex he\xc2\x92s going to be playing your son.'
Joey	 Hi Alex! (to the director) And uh, as you can see my hands are not in my\npants. (Holds them both up.)'
The Director	 Okay. (to Alex) All right uh, Alex now when Joey says his line,\n"Take good care of your Momma son," that\xc2\x92s your cue to cry. Got it? (Alex\nnods yes.) All right, let\xc2\x92s do this.'
A Crew Member	 (with that board thingy) Scene 5, take 1.'
The Director	 And Action!'
Joey	 "Take could care of your Momma son." (Alex just looks at him and\nthe director motions for him to continue so he tries it again.) "Take could care of\nyour Momma son." (Alex does nothing.) "Come on son! Your Momma\xc2\x92s good\npeople!"'
The Director	 Cut! Alex, remember you\xc2\x92re supposed to cry. Can you cry for\nus this time?'
Alex	 Okay.'
The Director	 All right, from the top.'
A Crew Member	 Scene 5, take 2.'
A Crew Member	 Take 36 is up!'
The Director	 All right! Let\xc2\x92s try this again! You ready Joe?'
Joey	 Ah, just one thing umm, is it all right with you if I, if I scream right\nup until you say action?'
The Director	 Uh sure.'
Joey	 Okay. (Starts screaming.)'
The Director	 Action!'
Joey	 (he stops screaming at action) "Take good care of your Momma\nson." (Again Alex does nothing.)'
The Director	 Cut!!!!!!!!!! (Joey starts screaming again.)'
Chandler	 I\xc2\x92m sorry! Hey-hey Joe, why don\xc2\x92t you uh, lift up your\nshirt? (He does.) Take a look at this kiddo. (Alex finally starts crying.) We\nhave a crying child! Roll the damn cameras!'
Rachel	 (answering it) Hello? '
Russell	 (Ross\xc2\x92s divorce lawyer.) Hello, is Ross there?'
Rachel	 Uh no, he\xc2\x92s not. Can I take a message?'
Russell	 Yes, this Russell, Ross\xc2\x92s divorce lawyer, just tell him that since\nI haven\xc2\x92t heard from him, I assume he\xc2\x92s decided to give the marriage a try.'
Rachel	 Ross got married again\xc2\x97Nooooooo!!!!!!!!!'
Ross	 (in his head) All right, keep going. We are phasing the accent out,\nphasing it out. So without out re-testing the results in the laboratory (pronounced\nthe British way) the team would never have identified (British) the initial errors in\ntheir carbon dating analysis (British). Were there any questions at this point? (One\nstudent raises his hand.) Yes. (Points to him.)'
A Student	 What\xc2\x92s happening to your accent?'
Ross	 (British) Come again? What\xc2\x92s-what\xc2\x92s this nonsense? (Giggles.)\n(American.) All right, I\xc2\x92m-I\xc2\x92m not English. I\xc2\x92m from Long Island. I was\nreally nervous and the accent just uh, just came out. I\xc2\x92m sorry. So, if we could just\nget back to the lecture. Umm, were there any questions? (Everyone raises their hands)\nAbout paleontology. (They all put their hands down.) All right, look I was just trying to\nmake a good first impression. Obviously, I screwed up. But what you guys think of me is\nreally important because I\xc2\x92m-I\xc2\x92m hoping to get a permanent job here. So if you\njust give me another chance to make a good impression\xc2\x85'
Rachel	 Ross!! Are you crazy?! I am still your wife!! What, were you just\nnever gonna tell me?!! What the hell is wrong with you?!!!! Ugh, I could just kill you!!!!'
Ross	 (in the accent again) Well, hello Rachel!'

Phoebe	 Have you really done this before?'
Joey	 Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! You just take a big, big swing. Now, don\xc2\x92t hold\nback. (He dons his protective helmet (Why, I have no clue.) and Phoebe picks up a wooden\nbaseball bat and starts to swing as Chandler and Monica enter.)'
Phoebe	 Hey!'
Joey	 Hey-hey-hey!'
Chandler	 What are you doing?'
Phoebe	 We\xc2\x92re just celebrating that Joey got his health insurance back.'
Chandler	 Oh, all right.'
