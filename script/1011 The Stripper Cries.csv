Joey	 Hey guys!'
Monica	 Hey, let me tell them!'
Joey	 Sure.'
Monica	 Joey is gonna be a celebrity guest on a game show!'
Phoebe	 Great!'
Ross	 Really? Which one?'
Monica	 (stopping Joey from answering) Ohh! Fish, seaweed, a sunken ship.'
Ross	 Things you find in the ocean, (to Joey) You\'re gonna be on "Pyramid"!!'
Monica	 Oh, that was our favourite game show ever!'
Ross	 Except for "Match game"...'
Monica	 Or "Win, Lose or Draw".'
Chandler	 What did I marry into?'
Joey	 Would you guys want to come down tomorrow and watch me tape the show?'
Monica	 Oh, I can't. We're throwing Phoebe a bachelorette party."
Phoebe	 Yeah, sorry boys, this ride's closing."
Ross	 Oh, and Chandler and I have this stupid college alumni thing. I can't believe you get to meet Donny Osmond."
Joey	 Seriously?'
Ross	 (very excited) Yeah-uh!'
Monica	 Ross and I always wanted to be Donny and Marie.'
Chandler	 You guys just keep getting cooler and cooler!'
Monica	 Yeah, we used to perform for our family and friends.'
Rachel	 Oh God, that's right. I blocked that out."
Monica	 (singing) "I\'m a little bit country"...'
Ross	 (singing) "...and I\'m a little bit rock \'n\' roll"!'
Chandler	 (to Monica) I'm leaving you.\n"

Ross	 So weird to see all these people again... Oh my God, look, there's Geoffrey Cleric."
Chandler	 Who?'
Ross	 He was roommates with John Rosoff. He went out with Andrea Tamburino. She dumped him for Michael Skloff.'
Chandler	 (looking around) Did I go to this school?'
Ross	 Hey, there's Missy Goldberg. You gotta remember her."
Chandler	 (looks over at her) Sure, nice.'
Ross	 Dude. You're married to my sister. "
Chandler	 You\'re right, by saying "nice" I\'m virtually licking her.'
Ross	 Hey, I hear she's single again, d'you think I should ask her out?"
Chandler	 Are you asking permission to break the pact?'
Ross	 Yes please.'
Ross	 Hey. Hey, check out the flyers for the band. I made 'em on a Macintosh in the computer room!"
Chandler	 Awesome, the name really stands out.'
Ross	 Thanks to a little something called "Helvetica Bold 24 point"!'
Chandler	 Man, we're gonna rock that Asian student union!"
Missy	 Hey guys!'
Chandler	 Hey!'
Ross	 Hey, Missy...'
Chandler	 You know, our band is playing on Friday.'
Ross	 Yeah, yeah. You should come check us out. We\'re called "Way! No Way!".'
Missy	 No way!'
Chandler and Ross	 Way!'
Missy	 Right. I'll be there. (she leaves)"
Chandler	 Fresh!'
Ross	 Boss!'
Chandler	 Mint!'
Ross	 She's gone."
Chandler	 I know it. You know, I'm totally gonna ask her out."
Ross	 Dude, I was gonna ask her out.'
Chandler	 I said it first, bro.'
Ross	 Well, I thought it first, Holmes.'
Chandler	 (angrily) Look, if you did...'
Ross	 Woha! Wait... What are we doing? What we have is too important to mess it up over some girl. I mean, we can get laid anytime we want.'
Chandler	 Totally. I had sex in High school...'
Ross	 Me too. I'm good at it."
Chandler	 All right, I'd say we make a pact. Neither of us will go out with Missy Goldberg."
Ross	 You got it.'
Chandler	 All right, so that's Missy Goldberg, Phoebe Cates and Molly Ringwald, who neither of us can go out with."
Ross	 Those are the pacts!'
Chandler	 Oh, and Sheena Easton. But we probably couldn't get her anyway."
Ross	 Oh, oh... maybe not you!'
Chandler	 Well, I officially give you permission to break the pact.'
Ross	 Thank you. (they shake hands) All right, here I go. Hey, remember how scary it used to be going up to girls in college?'
Chandler	 Your hands are shaking.'
Ross	 I know, and I can't stop sweating. (he walks towards Missy)"
Voice	 Five! Four! Three! Applause!'
Donny Osmond	 Yeah! Welcome, it is Soap Opera week here on Pyramid, let\'s meet our contestants. First, Gene Lester is a database specialist, he\'s gonna be playing with "Days of Our Life\'s" star Joey Tribbiani! (Joey\'s amazed at the place and he keeps looking around till he realizes the audience is applauding him)'
Joey	 (to Gene) I know it could be intimidating for regular people to be around celebrities but... relax, I'm just like you! (pause) Only better looking and richer."
Donny	 ...should be playing with the star of "General Hospital" Leslie Charleson. (applause) Welcome everybody. Good luck to all of you. Let\'s play Pyramid. All right? Now... we flipped a coin before the show, Gene, you won the toss, so you\'re gonna start. Which category would you like?'
Gene	 I\'ll take "You crossed the line".'
Donny	 You crossed the line. Joey, describe for Gene these things that have lines. Give me 20 seconds on the clock, please. Ready, go!'
Joey	 (on the screen there\'s the word "Supermarket") Uhm... ok. It\'s a store, like a supermarket. (there is a sound indicating he made a mistake as he shouldn\'t have said \'supermarket\'. The next word appears, "notebook") Oh! I see-I see what I did. Yeah, ok, ok, uhm... I\'m writing in my...'
Gene	 Diary.'
Joey	 Noo, (whispering) more like a notebook... Damn it! (next word appears
Gene	 Cafeteria.'
Joey	 Yeah! But that is not what they're looking for. (time's finished) OOOH!"
Phoebe	 (to Rachel) Thank you so much for this.'
Rachel	 Oh, d'you like it? "
Phoebe	 Oh my God, it's all so elegant! When's the dirty stuff starting?"
Rachel	 What?'
Phoebe	 You know, the strippers, and the guys dancing, and you know, pee-pee's flying about."
Rachel	 Pheebs, I... there isn't gonna be any flying about! We actually thought we were a little too mature for stuff like that."
Phoebe	 Oh, ok. I see what you're doing, that's fine. This is all there is, just tea, uh, ok. (she drinks her tea) Hmmmm... raunchy!"
Rachel	 Seriously Pheebs, it's not gonna be that kind of a party."
Phoebe	 Really? So this is... this is my big send off in the married life? Rachel this is the only bachelorette party I'm ever gonna have! I've got a big wad of ones in my purse! Really? I mean, really? It's just tea? "
Rachel	 Nooo! Phoebe, of course there is more! I mean, I'll just go and talk to Monica and get an ETA on the pee-pee's!"
Donny	 Now Gene I must remind you, you need all six of these to stay in the game, all right? Describe for Joey things you find in your refrigerator.'
Joey	 Ahaha, he might as well just give us the points.'
Donny	 Give me twenty seconds on the clock. Ready? Go!'
Gene	 You put this in your coffee.'
Joey	 A spoon. Your hands. Your face!'
Gene	 It's white!"
Joey	 Paper, snow, a ghost! '
Gene	 It's heavier then milk!"
Joey	 A rock, a dog, the earth.'
Gene	 Pass! '
Gene	 You put this on a sandwich.'
Joey	 Salami, anchovies, jam!'
Gene	 It's white!"
Joey	 Paper, snow, a ghost!'
Gene	 It's made from eggs!"
Joey	 Chickens?'
Gene	 Pass!'
Joey	 Oh!'
Gene	 You put this on a hamburger!'
Joey	 Ketchup!'
Gene	 Yes!'
Joey	 Relish!'
Gene	 Stop!'
Joey	 Oh.'
Donny	 Oh, time's up! Joey! You were, uh, almost on a roll there..."
Joey	 Yeah...'
Donny	 Uh, Gene, you're gonna have a chance to go to the winner circle in the second half. But right now Henrietta you are going to the winner circle to try your luck for ten thousand dollars, right after this, don't go away."
Stage Manager 	 And we're out!"
Joey	 Oh, so we didn't win, but it's fun to play the game, right?"
Gene	 Hey! I got a kid starting college. I've to get surgery on my knee, you just lost me ten grand!"
Joey	 Oh, wow! I'm so sorry, ok? I promise, we'll do better next time!"
Gene	 Well, I will, because I won't be playing with you."
Joey	 Hey, you know, some of those are pretty hard! Like why would there be a ghost in my fridge? (pause). Yeah!'
Ross	 So, Saturday night!'
Missy	 I'd love to!"
Ross	 Great!'
Missy	 So how come it took you so long to ask me out?'
Ross	 Oh, well, uh, this is gonna sound kinda silly, but, do you remember my roommate Chandler Bing?'
Missy	 Sure, he was in your "band"? (she air quotes band)'
Ross	 It's been sixteen years but the air quotes still hurt."
Missy	 Sorry.'
Ross	 That's ok. Uh, anyway, well he and I both really liked you a lot, uhm, but we didn't want anything to jeopardize our friendship, so we kinda made a pact, that neither of us could ask you out!"
Missy	 Really?'
Ross	 Yeah, why?'
Missy	 Well, Chandler and I used to make out! A lot!'
Ross	 You did?'
Missy	 Yeah. We'd go to the science lab after hours!"
Ross	 (angrily) AND ON MY TURF?'
Monica	 (to Rachel) Hey, where is this guy, it's been over an hour!"
Rachel	 Well, he's coming from Jersey, he said he would get here as fast as he could!"
Monica	 Who is it?'
Man	 It's the police!"
Rachel	 (pretends to be shocked) Uh! The police!'
Phoebe	 (Excited, running back to her seat) Oh!'
Man	 That's right, it's officer Goodbody."
Monica	 What's the matter, officer? Has someone been bad? (looks over to Phoebe and she opens the door, and to their dismay, the stripper is an old, short, fat guy who looks exhausted)"
Roy, the male stripper	 (coughs) Whoo, that's a lot of stairs!\n"

Roy	 Ooh, boy. You should warn people there's no elevator! I should not have had that Mexican food for lunch."
Monica	 Are you gonna be ok, officer, uhm,...'
Roy	 Goodbody!'
Monica	 ...If-you-say-so. '
Roy	 So where's the young lady who I'm supposed to take (he shakes his hips) downtown! (Monica points Phoebe)"
Phoebe	 Oh, God!'
Roy	 All right, somebody show me where to plug in my box, and we'll get this party started! (he thrusts his pelvis towards Phoebe) Whaaaa... (walks back to plug in his cd player) Here? All right."
Phoebe	 Rachel?'
Rachel	 Yeah?'
Phoebe	 Are you kidding?'
Rachel	 All right, look, we did not know that you wanted a stripper so we went to the phonebook and we got the first name we could find!'
Phoebe	 How old is your phonebook?'
Monica	 Oh my God, this man is gonna get naked in my apartment!'
Phoebe	 Oh God no, I don't wanna see him take his clothes off!"
Roy	 Are you talking about me?'
Monica	 Oh, no! I mean, obviously we want to see you take your clothes off! You big piece of eye candy!'
Roy	 Ok, ok, ladies! Can I have your attention, please? (pause) Did someone call for the long arm of the law? (He extends his arm from around his crotch and then upward and outward, towards Phoebe) I should warn you, I have a concealed weapon! (Puts his hands over his crotch) I hope you're familiar with the States penal code, ok, ok, enough teasing. Now for some pleasing!"
Roy	 Whoa, whoa, whoa (he turn off the music). She cringed!'
Phoebe	 This is how I look when I'm turned on!"
Roy	 You were talking about me before! Look, I don't need this! I'm outta here! Where's my hat? (goes to get it) Look, I've been in this business for a long time!"
Phoebe	 Shocking!'
Roy	 Now if you just pay me my three hundred dollars, I'll be on my way!"
Phoebe	 Three hundred dollars, are you kidding?'
Rachel	 No, that's ok, let's me just get my check book!"
Phoebe	 No, you're not gonna pay him, he didn't do anything!"
Roy	 Didn't do anything? I took a bus all the way from Hoboken. I climbed ... I dunno... like a billion stairs... It's not like I can take them two at a time! "
Phoebe	 I don't care. We're not paying you 300 dollars for this."
Roy	 Well, look - it's not my fault if you're too uptight to appreciate the male form in all it's glory."
Phoebe	 Oh yeah, okay. I'm uptight. Yeah, that's why I don't want to watch a middle aged guy dance around in what I can only assume is a child halloween costume! (turns to look at Monica and Rachel who look like they feel very sorry for the stripper)"
Roy	 I may have borrowed this from my nephew, but let me assure you, what's underneath (points at his groin)... is all man."
Phoebe	 I'm sorry, did you say all man or old man?"
Roy	 (making a crying face) Oh, you're mean!"
Monica	 (walks towards Phoebe and the stripper) Uh, look, officer... uhm Sir...'
Roy	 Damnit. OH! (To Phoebe) Big surprise! The hunk of beef has feelings!'
Donny	 Ok Henrietta, you've picked Jack and Jill went up the hill."
Joey	 (To Henrietta) My friend Rachel has a kid. I totally know nursery rhymes! (makes a thumbs up sign)'
Donny	 Joey describe these things associated with the United States congress. (Joey goes form looking very confident to looking very shocked the instant the word congress is said) Give me 20 seconds on the clock please. Ready? Go!'
Joey	 Oh, .. uh... uh... pass. (Next word
Henrietta	 Uvula!'
Joey	 Oh, then pass. (Next word
Donny	 O-kay... Henrietta, you didn't get all the points you needed, so that means Gene, you are going to the winners circle to try for ten thousand dollars! (Gene is clapping his hands looking very happy and so is Joey) And you're gonna be going there with Joey Tribbiani (Both of their smiles fade away instantly)"
Ross	 (To Chandler) You made out with Missy Goldberg. How could you do that, after you promised me?'
Chandler	 (to the two guys) Excuse me. (Chandler and Ross move away from them). That didn't make us sound gay at all!"
Ross	 You broke the pact! '
Chandler	 Ross, that was 16 years ago!'
Ross	 That doesn't matter! We're talking about the foundation of our friendship."
Chandler	 I believe the foundation of our friendship was unfortunate hair. (Ross just stares at him) All right, look, if we're really gonna do this... it's not like you never broke one of the pacts."
Ross	 I didn't."
Chandler	 Oh really?'
Ross	 No.'
Chandler	 Oh really!?'
Ross	 NO!'
Chandler	 ADRIENNE TURNER!! (A girl behind them turns around)'
Adrienne	 Yes?'
Chandler and Ross	 Hey! Hey Adrienne. (They move away from her)'
Ross	 I never did anything with Adrienne Turner.'
Chandler	 Oh please, and you knew how much I liked her.'
Ross	 I don't know what... you're talking about."
Chandler	 Really?'
 Present Chandler's voice	 Remember that big party? Freshman year? A week before Christmas vacation? I do. You had some visitors."
Monica	 I can't believe we are at a real college party! (Rachel laughs excitedly) I have to pee so bad!"
Rachel	 This is so awesome! College guys are so cute!'
Monica	 Hey, you've got a boyfriend!"
Rachel	 I know. But if some guy who looks like Corey Haim wants to kiss me tonight, I'm sooo gonna let them! (They spot Chandler)"
Monica	 Look, there's Chandler. You knew, that stupid friend of Ross'. Said I'm fat. You know I've already lost 4 pounds!"
Rachel	 It... You can so totally tell. '
Monica	 I KNOW!'
Rachel	 Well lets see. Maybe he knows where Ross is. (They walk towards Chandler) Hey, how's it going (tries to look as un-interested in him as possible - checking out her nails)."
Chandler	 Aren't you...?"
Rachel	 Yeah, Rachel. And this (points to Monica) is Ross' sister, Monica. We met at Thanksgiving. (looks around the room as if searching for something more interesting to do)."
Chandler	 (smiling at Monica) Right. (to Rachel) So how're you doing? "
Rachel	 Bitchin'"
Chandler	 Hi Monica.'
Monica	 Hi Chandler. It's really nice to see you (rolls her eyes) NOT. (she and Rachel giggle a little and Chandler looks unimpressed)"
Chandler	 O-kay. I'll see if I can find Ross. (Goes off to find Ross.)"
Monica	 Oh my God Rach. Bean bag chairs.'
Rachel	 Oh.'
Monica	 Do NOT let me sit in one of those. We'll be here for days."
Ross	 Listen Adrienne, you can't tell Chandler about this."
Adrienne	 Oh believe me, Ross, I won't be telling anybody about this."
Ross	 Cool! (They start kissing again and Chandler looks shocked)'
Ross	 I didn't know you knew about that."
Chandler	 Well, I did and it hurt. (they walk towards the bar) That\'s when I wrote the song
Ross	 (looks disappointed in himself) Man... I... I'm sorry."
Chandler	 Look (hands him a drink) it was a lo-o-ong time ago.'
Ross	 So, eh. I made out with Adrienne and you made out with Missy. Well I guess we're even."
Chandler	 (smiling a little nervously) Hmm mmmhm..'
Ross	 We are even, right?'
Chandler	 (sighs) Just one more thing. I was so pissed at you that night that I wanted to get back at you. So I thought, who does Ross like the more than anybody?'
Ross	 (thinks about it for a few seconds) What did you do to my mom?'
Chandler	 Not her!'
Rachel	 I am sooo drunk.'
Monica	 That's weird. I've had the same number of beers as you and I don't feel anything at all. (Chandler approaches)"
Chandler	 Soo... you girls having fun?'
Monica	 For your information, ass munch, I've lost four pounds. Maybe even five with all the dancing. (A guy enters holding a pizza box)"
Pizza guy	 SOMEBODY ORDER A PIZZA?'
Monica	 Oh THATS ME! (she runs to the pizza guy)'
Rachel	 (finishing the last of her drink) I am soo not going to do good on my SATs tomorrow. '
Chandler	 Well maybe if you go to school here next year we can totally hang out.'
Rachel	 (sarcastic) Oh yeah. There is a plan! Why don't I just start taking my smart pills now?"
Chandler	 Well, maybe you can get in on a beauty scholarship.'
Rachel	 (blushing) Oh, what a line. (walks towards the drinks table with her back towards Chandler and whispers "Oh my God!")'
Chandler	 So where are you applying to? '
Rachel	 Oh well, You know, I think it's kinda really important that I go somewhere where there's sun, so I'm sort of... (Chandler leans in an kisses her) (She pulls away) Hey!"
Chandler	 I'm in college and I'm in a band. "
Rachel	 (She considers it for a second) Yeah okay. (She puts her hands around his neck and they start kissing again)'
Roy	 What's the matter? You never saw a 50 year old stripper cry before?"
Phoebe	 You know, it's fine. We'll pay you."
Roy	 No, no, you're right. Who am I kidding? I should have hung up that breakaway jockstrap years ago. What am I gonna do? I mean, this has been my life for thirty two years. Taking my clothes off in front of people is all I know."
Rachel	 No, wait. No there's gotta be something else that you can do. I mean, what skills do you have?"
Roy	 I don't know... I can make my pecs dance... I can pick up a dollar bill with my butt cheeks... I can go to that special place inside me where I feel no shame."
Rachel	 So maybe something in an office.'
Phoebe	 Or you could teach stripping. You know, share your gift, pass the torch.'
Roy	 You know, actually that's not a bad idea. I can do it out of my apartment. I don't think my mom would mind."
Phoebe	 There you go. Okay, do you think you're gonna be okay?"
Roy	 Yeah, yeah, yeah... This is so weird. I mean, you never know when it's gonna be your last dance. And I didn't even get a chance to finish it."
Phoebe	 (after a pause) Finish it!'
Roy	 What?'
Phoebe	 Your last dance. Do it for us.'
Roy	 Really?'
Rachel	 (to Phoebe) Really?'
Phoebe	 Yeah, yeah. He deserves to do the thing he loves one last time. '
Roy	 Okay, all right... Get ready ladies!'
Phoebe	 Oh this is so ho-o-ot!'
Phoebe	 Oh no, no, no, don't stop!"
Roy	 (out of breath) Have to...'
Donny	 Well, welcome to the Winner Circle. Joey and Gene, you guys ready?'
Joey	 (nervously) Yeah...'
Gene	 (irritable) Sure. (Joey gets even more nervous)'
Donny	 Okay. Give me sixty seconds on the clock please... Ready, GO! (runs off)'
Gene	 Oak, maple, elm, birch...'
Joey	 I-I-I don't know. Types of trees?"
Gene	 Uhm... Buenos d\xc3\xadas, enchilada, por favor...'
Joey	 (sympathetic) Oh, I'm so sorry. I don't know any Spanish words."
Gene	 A match, a candle...'
Joey	 Things that go "tssst" when you put them out.'
Gene	 A torch, a bonfire... (Joey seems lost) uhm, your pee...'
Joey	 Things that burn.'
Gene	 "I\'d like to go for a walk", uhm "scratch my belly".'
Joey	 Dude, dude! I think you're losing it."
Gene	 Uhm, "I have fur", "I like to bark".'
Joey	 Oh, oh, oh... What a dog says.'
Gene	 Pepperoni...'
Joey	 (instantly) Pizza toppings, next!'
Gene	 Cindy Crawford, Christie Brinkley, Heidi Klum, Claudia Schiffer...'
Joey	 Oh, oh, oh... (5 seconds left)'
Gene	 Christie Turlington, Kate Moss...'
Joey	 Girls Chandler could never get?'
Gene	 (irritated) Supermodels!'
Joey	 Where? (looking around)'
Ross	 Hey, where's Rachel?"
Monica	 She and Phoebe took the stripper to the hospital.'
Ross	 Did you know Chandler kissed Rachel?'
Monica	 What? When was this?'
Ross	 Nineteen Eighty Seven. The weekend you guys visited me at school.'
Monica	 Oh my God! That's wild!"
Chandler	 Yeah, but it was like a million years ago, so it doesn't matter."
Ross	 Well, it matters to me.'
Chandler	 Why?'
Ross	 Because... the night you kissed Rachel was the night I kissed Rachel for the very first time.'
Chandler	 You kissed her that night too?'
Monica	 Two guys in one night? Wow, I thought she became a slut after she got her nose fixed.'
Chandler	 Seriously, where did this happen?'
Ross	 Okay, after you told me she was passed out in our room, I went in there to make sure she was all right. She was lying on my bed, all buried in peoples coats. Well, I went to kiss her on the forehead, you know. But it was so dark, I accidentally got her lips. I started to pull away, but then I felt her start to kiss me back. It was only for a second, but... it was amazing. And now, now I find out that you kissed her first.'
Chandler	 Oh wait... What bed did you say she was on?'
Ross	 Mine.'
Chandler	 I'm pretty sure I put her on my bed."
Ross	 No, she was definitely on my bed. '
Chandler	 Why would I kiss a girl, and then put her on your bed?'
Ross	 Well, then who was on my bed?'
Monica	 (screeching) OH! Oh, oh! (holding her hand in front of her mouth)'
Ross	 (realizing) NO! No, no!'
Monica	 YES! (Chandler gets an "oh no!" look on his face)'
Ross	 You were under the pile of coats?'
Monica	 I was the pile of coats!'
Ross	 OH MY GOD!'
Monica	 You were my Midnight Mystery Kisser?'
Ross	 You were my first kiss with Rachel?'
Monica	 You were my first kiss ever?'
Chandler	 What did I marry into?\n'

Monica	 Oh, crap!'
