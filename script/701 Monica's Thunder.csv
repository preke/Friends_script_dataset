Monica	 Okay! Wait-wait-wait! Shhh! (Bangs on her class with a spoon to make a\ntoast.) Okay, umm, I just wanna say that\xc2\x85I love you guys so-so much and-and thank you\nfor being here on my special night. (Chandler clears his throat.) Our special night.

Phoebe	 So have you decided on a band for the wedding? Because, y\xc2\x92know,\nI\xc2\x92m kinda musical.'
Rachel	 Yeah Pheebs, honey, she just got engaged a couple of hours ago. I doubt\nshe\xc2\x92s even had time to\xc2\x85'
Phoebe	 Well speaking of chiming in, remember the time you burned down my\napartment?'
Rachel	 (To Monica) Yeah, you\xc2\x92re on your own.'
Monica	 Y\xc2\x92know what we should do? We should all get dressed up and go to\nhave champagne at The Plaza.'
Joey	 But I-I-I can\xc2\x92t stay too long, I gotta get up early for a commercial\naudition tomorrow and I gotta look good. I\xc2\x92m supposed to be playing a 19-year-old.\n(Everyone stops in their tracks upon hearing this.) What?'
Chandler	 So when you said, "Get up early," did you mean 1986?'
Joey	 You guys don\xc2\x92t think I look 19?'
Phoebe	 Oh, 19! We thought you said 90!'
Monica	 Okay everybody, let\xc2\x92s go! Let\xc2\x92s go!'
Rachel	 Okay.'
Chandler	 Okay.'
Joey	 (To Phoebe) Hey, is uh the rest of my candy bar around here?'
Phoebe	 Oh honey no, you ate it all.'
Joey	 I was afraid of that. '
Monica	 (looking at her hand) Y\xc2\x92know what shoes would look great with this\nring? Diamond shoes! (Sees Chandler sitting on the bed.) You\xc2\x92re not getting dressed.\n(Chandler quietly folds over the comforter on the bed making a spot for her.)'
Chandler	 Know what I mean?'
Monica	 Yeah, but I don\xc2\x92t think we have time.'
Chandler	 There\xc2\x92s gonna be a wedding. You\xc2\x92re gonna be the bride. Two\nhundred people are going to be looking at you in a clean white dress.'
Monica	 (lustily) Let\xc2\x92s do it! (She kisses him and they fall back onto the\nbed.)'
Monica	 (chasing after him) Chandler! It happens to lots of guys! You-you-you\nwere probably tired, you had a lot of champagne, don\xc2\x92t worry about it!'
Chandler	 (motioning with his hands) I\xc2\x92m not worried, I\xc2\x92m uh, I\xc2\x92m\nfascinated. Y\xc2\x92know it\xc2\x92s like uh, Biology! Which is funny because in high school\nI uh, I-I failed Biology and tonight Biology failed me. (Exits as Phoebe enters from her\nroom with her guitar.)'
Phoebe	 Check it out. Okay, I can play this when the guests are coming in. Okay.\n(Singing) '
Monica	 Phoebe!'
Phoebe	 If you would\xc2\x92ve let me finish, it goes on to say that he\xc2\x92s\nprobably not gay.'
Chandler	 Sure, you guys don\xc2\x92t have this problem, you\xc2\x92re made of wood.\n(Rachel comes out of the bathroom) Hey!'
Rachel	 Hey!'

Rachel	 Oh, I know. Hey, y\xc2\x92know what we never did? (Ross looks at her.) Oh\nno, not that. (Ross nods okay.) We uh, we never had bonus night!'
Ross	 A what?'
Rachel	 Y\xc2\x92know, bonus night. Y\xc2\x92know, when two people break up but they\nget back together for just one night.'
Ross	 One night, just-just sex. No strings attached?'
Rachel	 Yeah-yeah, we never had that,'
Ross	 No.'
Ross	 Okay, this is getting a little crazy. I mean, I\xc2\x92m-I\xc2\x92m sure it\nwould be amazing but I\xc2\x85gotta say I really-really don\xc2\x92t think it would be a good\nidea. Y\xc2\x92know? I really, really\xc2\x85don\xc2\x92t.'
Joey	 \xc2\x91Sup? \xc2\x91Sup dude?'

Chandler	 Young! You\xc2\x92re a man-child okay?! Now go get changed because\neverybody\xc2\x92s ready and please, oh please, keep my underwear!'
Joey	 Wow thanks! (He goes into his bedroom and closes the door.)'
Chandler	 Joe?'
Joey	 Yeah!'
Chandler	 Uhh, you\xc2\x92ve had a lot of sex right?'
Joey	 When? Today? Some, not a lot.'
Chandler	 Well, it\xc2\x92s just the reason that I\xc2\x92m asking is because I kind\nof eh, uh, I was unable to\xc2\x97I mean I really wanted too, but I couldn\xc2\x92t\xc2\x85.\nThere huh\xc2\x97hmm, there-there was an incident.'

Chandler	 It\xc2\x92s happened to you?'
Joey	 Yeah! Once.'
Chandler	 Well, what\xc2\x92d you do?'
Joey	 I did it anyway.'
Monica	 Phoebe! Come on! Let\xc2\x92s go! (Knocks on her door.) Come on! (Phoebe\nenters with guitar and not ready to go.) Why aren\xc2\x92t you dressed yet?!'
Phoebe	 I\xc2\x92m sorry, but I just wrote the best dance song for your wedding.\nCheck this out. (Gets ready to play.)'
Monica	 (grabs the guitar away from her) No, Phoebe, I\xc2\x92ll tell you what, if\nyou get ready now I\xc2\x92ll let you play it at the wedding.'
Phoebe	 Really?! Oh that\xc2\x92s so exciting! Thank you! Thanks Mon! Oh but Mon,\nif you touch my guitar again I\xc2\x92ll have to pound on you for a little bit.'
Monica	 Fair enough, now go get ready!'

Monica	 I\xc2\x92ll get everybody else (Does so), finally we can start celebrating\nmy\xc2\x97(She gasps and is stopped by the sight of Ross and Rachel making out in the hall.)\nI\xc2\x92m sorry, uh apparently I\xc2\x92ve opened the door to the past.'

Ross	 Okay, Monica. Mon, uh what-what you just saw\xc2\x85'
Monica	 (interrupting) Can I ask you just a little question, huh? Why tonight?'
Rachel	 What?'
Monica	 See, I\xc2\x92ve been waiting my whole life to be engaged, and unlike some\npeople I\xc2\x92m only planning on doing this once. So, uh y\xc2\x92know, maybe this is\nselfish and I\xc2\x92m sorry about it, but I was kinda hoping tonight could just be about\nthat.'
Rachel	 Oh honey, but it is just about\xc2\x85'
Ross	 It is! It is!'
Monica	 No it\xc2\x92s not! No! No! Now it\xc2\x92s about you and Ross getting back\ntogether!'
Rachel	 What?!'
Monica	 See yeah umm, you kinda stole my thunder!'
Ross	 Okay! Ho-ho! We did not steal your thunder because we are not\ngetting back together!'
Rachel	 Yeah. No. And you know what? Nobody even saw!'
Ross	 Yeah!'
Monica	 That\xc2\x92s true.'
Rachel	 Honey I swear it we just kissed. '
Ross	 It was just a kiss. (Phoebe enters and overhears this.)'
Phoebe	 You guys kissed!!!!! What does this mean?!! Are you, are you getting\nback together?! Can I sing at your wedding?'
Monica	 Thunder being stolen!!'
Rachel	 Okay come on Phoebe, it\xc2\x92s nothing! Monica, come on!'
Ross	 Look let\xc2\x92s not make a big deal out of this! It was a one time\nthing. It doesn\xc2\x92t even matter!'
Joey	 Oh my God! I cannot believe you guys are talking about this! The problems\nin the bedroom are between the man and the woman!!! All right?!! Now Chandler is doing the\nbest he can!!'
Chandler	 (angrily) I don\xc2\x92t think that\xc2\x92s what they were talking about\nJoe!!'
Phoebe	 What a great night, Chandler can\xc2\x92t do it, these guys kissed\xc2\x85\n(Points to Ross and Rachel.)'
Joey	 What? '
Chandler	 What?!'
Joey	 You guys kissed! Oh my\xc2\x97this is huge!'
Rachel	 No!'
Ross	 Oh no!'
Rachel	 No-no, it\xc2\x92s really not huge.'
Ross	 And; people thinking it\xc2\x92s huge has led Monica to believe that we\nare stealing her thunder. (To Monica) Which we are not!'
Monica	 Well, we\xc2\x92re still talking about it, aren\xc2\x92t we?'
Phoebe	 Well yeah, that and Chandler\xc2\x92s problem.'
Joey	 Monica-Monica-Monica-Monica, listen-listen, listen, listen, would-would it\nmake you feel better if we all stop talking about Ross and Rachel.'
Monica	 Yes that would be lovely.'
Joey	 You got it. Okay. Now, I can pass for 19 right?!'
Chandler	 Yes, you can pass for 19.'
Joey	 Really?'
Chandler	 Yes!'
Joey	 Seriously?'
Chandler	 Seriously? Seriously, no! You can play your own age which is 31!'
Joey	 (gasps) I\xc2\x92m 30!'
Rachel	 Joey, you are not! You\xc2\x92re 31.'
Joey	 (realizes) Aww crap!'
Phoebe	 Okay, so The Plaza! Okay, we\xc2\x92ll get us some Mai Thai\xc2\x92s,\n(To Chandler) maybe no more for you though.'
Monica	 Y\xc2\x92know what? I-I think that umm, I don\xc2\x92t feel like going to The\nPlaza.'
Phoebe	 Why?!'
Rachel	 Honey, Monica, this is ridiculous! Look\xc2\x85'
Monica	 No-no, I-I really don\xc2\x92t want to talk about it! I don\xc2\x92t! (To\nRachel) Especially with you. (Goes into her room.)'
Joey	 Psss, that is whack!'
Phoebe	 (she\xc2\x92s strumming something) Yeah? (Joey nods yes.) Okay, I think\nI\xc2\x92ll play it at the wedding.'
Joey	 Yeah! Well, I think we\xc2\x92ll see if they actually let you play. Huh? I\nmean they tell you anything you want to hear like-like, "You look 19," and then\nthey just take it away like-like, "No you don\xc2\x92t."'
Phoebe	 Well, I don\xc2\x92t think Monica is gonna take this away.'
Joey	 Wouldn\xc2\x92t she?'
Phoebe	 Would she?'
Joey	 Would she? (He smells something and gasps as he realizes what it is.) You\nate my candy bar!'
Ross	 Guess who? (Enters fully.)'
Rachel	 Hey.'
Ross	 Hey, I just realized we kinda let some stuff up in the air\xc2\x85'
Rachel	 What do you think Monica mean when she said she didn\xc2\x92t want to\ntalk, especially with me? I mean, why not especially you and me? We were both out there\nkissing.'
Ross	 Still thinking about it huh?'
Rachel	 Come on! Serious-ser-ser-seriously, what did she mean by that?\n(Mimicking Monica.) Especially you!'
Ross	 (loosening his tie) Oh, who cares?'
Rachel	 I care!'
Ross	 (tightening his tie) And so do I.'
Rachel	 Y\xc2\x92know what, I-I have to go talk to her, would you let me just get\nchanged?'
Ross	 Okay. Sure. (Sits down on her bed.)'
Rachel	 Am I going to let you watch me undress?'
Ross	 (sitting up) No! (Exits.)'
Monica	 I can\xc2\x92t believe her, y\xc2\x92know it\xc2\x92s just\xc2\x97it\xc2\x92s so\ntypical.'
Chandler	 Now Monica, I know you\xc2\x92re upset, but don\xc2\x92t forget. There is\ngoing to be a wedding, you are going to throw the bouquet, and then there\xc2\x92s\ngoing to be a honeymoon, maybe in Paris.'
Monica	 Paris?'
Chandler	 We will take a moonlit walk on the Rue de la (mumbles something).'
Monica	 Keep talking.'
Chandler	 Then we will sprinkle rose pedals on the bed and make love. Not just\nbecause it\xc2\x92s romantic, but because I can!'
Monica	 I love you!'
Monica	 (in a French accent) Bonjour, monsieur.'
Chandler	 Okay, don\xc2\x92t say anything, you might scare it away.'
Chandler	 It\xc2\x92s Paris, who knows we\xc2\x92re here!'
Monica	 (opening the door) Hi Pheebs, what\xc2\x92s up? (She enters.)'
Phoebe	 Okay, you said I could sing at your wedding so, I\xc2\x92m just gonna need\na small deposit.'
Monica	 What?!'
Phoebe	 Y\xc2\x92know, just some good faith money to hold the date.'
Chandler	 Pheebs, we\xc2\x92re not giving you a deposit for our wedding!'
Phoebe	 Oh, I see. (Exits angrily.)'
Joey	 They break your heart, don\xc2\x92t they?'
Phoebe	 Y\xc2\x92know, I don\xc2\x92t really their permission.'
Joey	 Yeah! If you wanna sing at their wedding, well you sing at their wedding!'
Phoebe	 Yeah! And if you wanna look 19, then you\xc2\x85 You gotta do something\nabout your eyes.'
Joey	 What?! What\xc2\x92s wrong with my eyes.'
Phoebe	 They give you away! There\xc2\x92s just-there\xc2\x92s just too much wisdom\nin there. (Joey nods in agreement.) Just put some tea bags on there for like 15 minutes.'
Joey	 And that\xc2\x92ll get rid of my wisdom?'
Phoebe	 Maybe just 10 minutes for you.'
Chandler	 Oh, give her the deposit! Give her the ring! I don\xc2\x92t care!'
Monica	 Yes.'
Rachel	 Monica, what did you mean before when you said you didn\xc2\x92t want to\ntalk to anyone, especially me?'
Chandler	 What a great apology! (To Monica) And you accept! Okay, bye-bye!'
Rachel	 No-no, seriously-seriously, what was the especially me part about?'
Monica	 Well, let\xc2\x92s just say it\xc2\x92s not the first time you\xc2\x92ve\nstolen my thunder.'
Rachel	 What?!'
Ross	 (To Rachel) Hey, here\xc2\x92s a thought.'
Rachel	 Monica, what are you talking about?'
Monica	 My Sweet Sixteen! Remember, you went to third base with my cousin\nCharlie.'
Chandler	 (entering) Ahh, third base.'
Monica	 It\xc2\x92s all everybody at the party could talk about!'
Rachel	 Monica, y\xc2\x92know what? The only reason I did that was because your\nparty was so boring!'
Monica	 (gasps) We had a characturist!'
Rachel	 Oh!! '
Phoebe	 (singing, angrily) '
Rachel	 Monica, your Sweet Sixteen was like a million years ago.'
Monica	 And yet, here we are doing it again.'
Rachel	 Ugh, Monica I don\xc2\x92t want to steal your stupid thunder!'
Monica	 Oh please! Why else would you have made out with Ross?!'
Ross	 Got me. (He shows of his hands.)'
Rachel	 All right, easy mimey, the moment has passed, it ain\xc2\x92t gonna\nhappen!'
Monica	 I just thought it would be nice if I could have just this one night!'
Rachel	 I swear, I never wanted any part of your night!'
Monica	 Oh, is that why you did it the secret hallway where nobody ever goes?!'
Ross	 Uh, Rachel, I\xc2\x92ve been thinking. I don\xc2\x92t think us getting\ntogether tonight is such a good idea. I\xc2\x92m calling it off.'
Chandler	 (To Ross) Why to save your dignity my man.'
Rachel	 (ignoring them) Monica, why? Why would I ever want to take away from\nyour night?'
Monica	 I don\xc2\x92t know! I don\xc2\x92t\xc2\x97maybe you\xc2\x92re feeling a little\nresentful. Maybe ah, maybe you thought you\xc2\x92d get married first! Maybe you can\xc2\x92t\nstand the fact that your formally fat friend is getting married before you!'
Rachel	 Oh wow. That\xc2\x97y\xc2\x92know what? That is so unfair. Y\xc2\x92know what?\nNow I want to steal your thunder! Come on Ross, let\xc2\x92s go have sex!'
Monica	 (yelling after them) I can\xc2\x92t believe you\xc2\x92re gonna have sex on\nmy engagement night!!'
Chandler	 Well, somebody should. (Monica glares at him.)'
Ross	 Look uh, if we\xc2\x92re gonna do this\xc2\x85'
Rachel	 We\xc2\x92re not gonna do this, all right? She\xc2\x92s just gonna think\nthat we\xc2\x92re doin\xc2\x92 it.'
Ross	 Oh, I see, so everybody wins. '
Rachel	 Who is it?'
Monica	 (outside the door) It\xc2\x92s Monica, open up!'
Rachel	 Okay well Ross! Stop it please! Wait a minute! (Motions for him to\nfollow her lead, but he angrily shakes his head no. So she pokes him.)'
Ross	 Oww!'
Rachel	 Yeah, you like that baby? (Monica bursts in followed by Chandler.) May\nwe help you?'
Monica	 I just wanted to say that I hope you do have sex tonight and I hope that\nyou guys get back together, but I must warn you, the night that you announce your\nengagement I\xc2\x92m going to announce that I\xc2\x92m pregnant!'
Chandler	 How is that ever going to happen?!'
Rachel	 All right Monica, do you want to know why I was with Ross tonight?!'
Monica	 I know why!'
Rachel	 No you don\xc2\x92t know why!'
Monica	 Okay! Why?!'
Rachel	 Because! Because I was sad.'
Monica	 What do you mean?'
Rachel	 Look, I am so\xc2\x85so happy for you guys, but you getting married just\nreminds me of the fact that I\xc2\x92m not. I\xc2\x92m not even close. And I don\xc2\x92t know,\nmaybe I just wanted to make myself feel better. And I know that that\xc2\x92s dumb, but oh\nmy God you were so depressed when Ross got married that you slept with Chandler!'
Chandler	 (To Ross) I don\xc2\x92t care, she slept with me.'
Rachel	 Anyway sweetie, I am, I\xc2\x92m so sorry I ruined your night.'
Monica	 (starting to cry) I\xc2\x92m sorry I almost made you sleep with Ross.\n(They hug.)'
Ross	 (deadpan) Well, I\xc2\x92m going to take off. (To Chandler) Congratulations\nman.'
Chandler	 Thanks.'
Ross	 (at the door) And uh, Rachel.'
Rachel	 Yeah.'
Ross	 What can I say, you missed your chance. From now on the only person\nwho\xc2\x92s going to enjoy these bad boys (holds up his hands) is me. (Quickly realizes\nwhat he said and exits disgustedly.) '

Phoebe	 (singing)'
Chandler	 (interrupting her just in time) Hey! Here\xc2\x92s a dollar, consider it\na deposit. Please sing at our wedding.'
Phoebe	 Oh thank you.'
Chandler	 Okay. (Goes back to bed.)'
Phoebe	 Now\xc2\x85 (Starts singing again) "Who will perform the ceremony!\nWho will perform the cer\xc2\x97(Chandler enters and grabs her guitar and closes the\ndoor behind him)\xc2\x97Oh\xc2\x97oh! All right, I\xc2\x92ll pound on him in the morning.'
