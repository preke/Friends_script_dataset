Joey	 Yeah, Rach, I think you\xc2\x92re handling that really well.'
Rachel	 Handling it? What do you mean, handling it? There\xc2\x92s nothing to\nhandle. Now, maybe I would have a problem with this if it wasn\xc2\x92t for me and Joshua.\nY\xc2\x92know, they\xc2\x92re not gonna get married anyway!'
Chandler	 What?'
Rachel	 Come on! They rushed into this thing so fast it\xc2\x92s ridiculous! I\nmean, they\xc2\x92re gonna be engaged for like what? A year?

Monica	 (upset) That was a terrible throw!!'
Phoebe	 I\xc2\x92m not gonna right to you! That\xc2\x92s not real!'
Monica	 Look at me! My big concern is what\xc2\x92s real?! (Finally realises) Oh\nmy God. We\xc2\x92re really sad, aren\xc2\x92t we?'
Phoebe	 Yeah, I think we are.'
Monica	 This isn\xc2\x92t even my dress.'
Phoebe	 Well, at least you didn\xc2\x92t rent yours from a store called,\n"It\xc2\x92s Not Too Late."'
Monica	 I\xc2\x92m changing out of this.'
Phoebe	 Me too.'
Monica	 In like a half-hour?'
Phoebe	 Me too.'
Monica	 Okay, throw it straight this time.'
Phoebe	 Okay.'
Monica	 I\xc2\x92m getting married next!!'
Phoebe	 Yay!'
Phoebe	 I hate my regular clothes now! Y\xc2\x92know? I look down and-and I\nknow that this isn\xc2\x92t gonna be the most special day of my life.'
Monica	 Yeah. I mean it was kinda fun for a while, but didn\xc2\x92t you start\nfeeling silly?'
Phoebe	 I guess.'
Phoebe	 Oh my God! '
Monica	 Oh God.'
Phoebe	 Oh, you\xc2\x92re such a cheater!'
Chandler	 (entering) Hello! Little ones.'
Monica	 Hey!'
Phoebe	 Hey!'
Monica	 So, is Joey gonna stop snoring?'
Chandler	 Yep! And! A beautiful woman agreed to go out with me. (They\xc2\x92re\nstunned.) Joey wanted to ask her out, but uh, she picked me.'
Phoebe	 Oh, how\xc2\x92d that happen?'
Chandler	 Because I\xc2\x92m cooler.'
Monica	 No, seriously.'
Chandler	 Well she\xc2\x92s, she\xc2\x92s the kinda girl\xc2\x97Joey was unconscious. '
Joey	 (muffled by the mouth guard) Hey you guys! What\xc2\x92s happening?'
Monica	 Oh my God!'
Phoebe	 What is that?'
Joey	 (muffled) Oh, they gave it to me at the sleep clinic, and it\xc2\x92s gonna\nhelp me not to snore.'
Monica	 Well, are you asleep right now, Joe? \xc2\x91Cause I don\xc2\x92t think you\nhave to wear it unless you are!'
Joey	 (takes out the mouth guard) I know I don\xc2\x92t have too! It tastes good.\n(Puts it back in.)'
Chandler	 Plus, you look cool.'
Rachel	 (entering from her bedroom) Well, I just called Joshua\xc2\x85'
Phoebe	 Oh, how did it go?'
Rachel	 Well, I did my best to convince him that I\xc2\x92m not some crazy girl\nwho is dying to get married\xc2\x97I\xc2\x92m just going through a hard time.'
Phoebe	 What did he say?'
Rachel	 Well uh, his answering machine was very understanding. Ugh. I\nfeel blue.'
Monica	 Ohh, sweetie! (Goes to comfort her.) Hey, I bet you anything that\nhe\xc2\x92s gonna call you again.'
Rachel	 Yeah, maybe, but I don\xc2\x92t think I even care. I don\xc2\x92t think\nhe\xc2\x92s the one I\xc2\x92m sad about. Y\xc2\x92know, I know that I said that I am totally\nokay with Ross getting married, but as it turns out, I don\xc2\x92t think I\xc2\x92m handling\nit all that well.'
Phoebe	 Yeah, maybe.'
Rachel	 And I-I am just trying to figure out why.'
Phoebe	 Any luck?'
Rachel	 Well, yeah, y\xc2\x92know how Ross and I were on again, off again, on\nagain, off again? I guess I just figured that somewhere down the road, we would be on\nagain.'
Monica	 Again. Y\xc2\x92know what? I think we all did.'
Ross	 (entering) Hey!'
Monica	 Hey! (She jumps up and throws Emily\xc2\x92s wedding dress into\nRachel\xc2\x92s room.)'
Ross	 So, I got us some reservations for Sunday night, okay? How about,\nErnie\xc2\x92s at 9 o\xc2\x92clock?'
Rachel	 Yeah, well, you uh, better make it for three.'
Ross	 Oh, see I-I don\xc2\x92t know if we\xc2\x92re gonna be hungry at three.'
Rachel	 Three people. Joshua\xc2\x92s not gonna be there.'
Ross	 What happened?'
Rachel	 Uh, well, I think, I think he broke up with me.'
Ross	 Noo. Why?'
Rachel	 Well, apparently he scares easy.'
Ross	 Oh, Rachel, I\xc2\x92m-I\xc2\x92m sorry.'
Rachel	 It\xc2\x92s okay. Sometimes, things don\xc2\x92t work out the way you\xc2\x92d\nthought they would.'
Ross	 Come here.'
Rachel	 (breaking the hug) Oh, hey, don\xc2\x92t you have to go pick up Emily?'
Ross	 Yeah. '
Rachel	 Yeah.'
Ross	 You okay?'
Rachel	 Yeah! I got my girls.'
Rachel	 Ugh. (She goes over and lays her head on Phoebe\xc2\x92s lap.)'
Phoebe	 (looks at Monica) Hey, y\xc2\x92know what might cheer you up?'
Rachel	 What?'
Rachel	 Y\xc2\x92know, I gotta tell ya, this really does put in a better mood.'
Monica	 Oh, I wish there was a job where I could wear this all the time. (Pause)\nMaybe someday, there will be.'
Monica	 Oh God! He\xc2\x92s gonna come by and borrow some candles for his big\ndate!'
Rachel	 Oh, okay! (She goes to answer the door.)'
Monica	 No-no, Rachel, don\xc2\x92t get it! He can\xc2\x92t see us!'
Phoebe	 No, yeah! The groom cannot see the bride!'
Rachel	 I\xc2\x92m not gonna marry Chandler!'
Phoebe	 Not after this!'
Rachel	 Okay, you guys, just relax. (She goes over to open the door, and as she\ndoes, she says.) I doooo. (Sees that it\xc2\x92s Joshua, not Chandler that knocked on the\ndoor.)'
Joshua	 I gotta go.'
Rachel	 Oh, wait, Joshua! Joshua! (Pause) (Comes back inside) Yeah, well, that\noughta do it.'

Joey	 (muffled by the mouth guard) Dude! I am trying to sleep! (Shrugs to\nsay, "What\xc2\x92s up with that?")'
