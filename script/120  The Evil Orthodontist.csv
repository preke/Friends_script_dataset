Chandler	 I can't believe you would actually say that. I would much\nrather be Mr.Peanut than Mr.Salty."
Joey	 No way! Mr.Salty is a sailor, all right, he's got to be, like, thetoughest\nsnack there is."
Ross	 I don't know, you don't wanna mess with corn nuts. They're craaazy."
Monica	 (looking out of the window) Oh my God. You guys! You gotta come see\nthis! There's some creep out there with a telescope!"
Ross	 I can't believe it! He's looking right at us!"
Rachel	 Oh, that is so sick.'
Chandler	 I feel violated. And not in a good way.'
Phoebe	 How can people do that?... (All but Phoebe walk away from the window in\ndisgust.) Oh, you guys, look! Ugly Naked Guy got gravity boots!'

Chandler	 I am telling you, years from now, schoolchildren will study it as one\nof the greatest first dates of all time. It was unbelievable! We could totally be\nourselves, we didn't have to play any games..."
Monica	 So have you called her yet?'
Chandler	 Let her know I like her? What are you, insane? (The girls make\ndisgusted noises.) It's the next day! How needy do I want to seem? (To the guys) I'm\nright, right?"
Joey and Ross	 Oh, yeah. Yeah. Let her dangle.'
Monica	 I can't believe my parents are actually pressuring me to find one of you\npeople."
Phoebe	 Oh, God, just do it! (Grabbing the phone.) Call her! Stop being so\ntestosteroney!'
Chandler	 Which, by the way, is the real San Francisco treat. (Calls her, then\nhurriedly hangs up.) I got her machine.'
Joey	 Her answer machine?'
Chandler	 No, interestingly enough her leaf blower picked up.'
Phoebe	 So, uh, why didn't you say anything?"
Chandler	 Oh, no-no-no-no. Last time I left a spontaneous message I ended up\nusing the phrase "Yes indeedy-o."'
Monica	 Look look! It's Rachel and Barry. No, don't everybody look at once!"
Ross	 Okay, okay, what's going on?"
Phoebe	 Okay, they're just talking..."
Ross	 Yeah, well, does he look upset? Does he look like he was just told to\nshove anything?'
Phoebe	 No, no actually, he's smiling.. and... Oh my God, don't do that!!"
Ross	 What? What? What?!'
Phoebe	 That man across the street just kicked that pigeon! (Rachel enters.) Oh!'
Chandler	 (bluffing) And basically, that's how a bill becomes a law."
All	 Oh!... Right!'
Chandler	 Hey Rach!'
Monica	 How'd it go?"
Rachel	 Y'know, it was, uh.. it was actually really great. He took me to lunch\nat the Russian Tea Room, and I had that chicken, where y'know you poke it and all\nthe butter squirts out..."
Phoebe	 Not a good day for birds...'
Rachel	 Then we took a walk down to Bendall's, and I told him not to,\nbut he got me a little bottle of Chanel..."
Ross	 That's nice... now, was that before or after you told him to stop calling,\nstop sending you flowers and to generally leave you alone, hmm?"
Rachel	 Right,.. well,.. we never actually got to that... Oh, it was just so\nnice to see him again, y'know? It was comfortable, it was familiar... it was just nice!"
Ross	 That's, that's nice twice!"
Monica	 Rachel, what's going on? I mean isn't this the same Barry who you left\nat the altar?"
Joey	 Duh, where've you been?"
Rachel	 Yeah, but it was different with him today! And he wasn't, like,\nOrthodontist Guy, y'know? I mean, we had fun! Is there anything wrong with that?"
Chandler	 Yes!'
Rachel	 Why?'
Chandler	 I have my reasons.'
Monica	 Okay, how about the fact that he's engaged to another woman, who just\nhappens to be your ex-best friend?"
Rachel	 All right. All right, all right, all right, all right, I know it's\nstupid! I will go see him this afternoon, and I will just put an end to it!"
Rachel	 Wow... Wow!'
Barry	 Yeah.'
Rachel	 I'm not crazy, right? I mean, it was never like that."
Barry	 Nooo, it wasn't."
Rachel	 Ooh, and it's so nice having this little sink here..."
Chandler	 (on phone, reading from a script) Oh, Danielle! I wasn't expecting the\nmachine... Give me a call when you get a chance. (Rattles some dishes) Bye-bye. (Hangs\nup.) Oh God!"
Monica	 That's what you've been working on for the past two\nhours?!"
Chandler	 Hey, I've been honing!"
Ross	 What was with the dishes?'
Chandler	 Oh, uh.. I want her to think I might be in a restaurant.. y'know? I\nmight have some kind of life, like I haven't been sitting around here honing for the past\nfew hours."
Monica	 (looking out the window) Look look! He's doing it again, the guy with\nthe telescope!"
Phoebe	 Oh my God! (Walks to the window) Go away! (Gesturing.) Stop looking in\nhere!'
Monica	 Great, now he's waving back."
Joey	 Man, we gotta do something about that guy. This morning, I caught him\nlooking into our apartment. It creeps me out! I feel like I can't do stuff!"
Monica	 What kinda stuff?'
Joey	 Will you grow up? I'm not talking about sexy stuff, but, like, when I'm\ncooking naked."
Phoebe	 You cook naked?'
Joey	 Yeah, toast, oatmeal... nothing that spatters.'
Chandler	 What are you looking at me for? I didn't know that."
Barry	 What's the matter?"
Rachel	 Oh, it's just... Oh, Barry, this was not good."
Barry	 No, it was. It was very very good.'
Rachel	 Well, what about Mindy?'
Barry	 Oh, way, way better than Mindy.'
Rachel	 No, not that, I mean, what about you and Mindy?'
Barry	 Well, if you want, I'll just\xc2\x97I'll just break it off with her."
Rachel	 No. No-no-no-no, no. I mean, don't do that. Not, I mean not for me. "
Bernice	 (over intercom) Dr. Farber, Bobby Rush is here for his adjustment.'
Barry	 (into intercom) Thanks, Bernice. (To Rachel) Let's go away this weekend."
Rachel	 Oh, Barry..! Come on, this is all way too..'
Barry	 We can, we can go to Aruba! When I went there on what would have been our\nhoneymoon, it was, uh... it was really nice. You would've liked it."
Rachel	 I had a bra.'
Bobby	 Hey, Dr. Farber.'
Barry	 All right Miss Green, everything looks fine... Yep, I think we're\nstarting to see some real progress here."
Rachel	 What?!'
Bobby	 I'm twelve, I'm not stupid."
Chandler	 Can I use your phone?'
Monica	 Yeah.. uh, but for future reference, that thing in your hand can also be\nused as a phone.'
Chandler	 Yes, it's working! Why isn't she calling me back?"
Joey	 Maybe she never got your message.'
Phoebe	 Y'know, if you want, you can call her machine, and if she has a lot of\nbeeps, that means she probably didn't get her messages yet."
Chandler	 Y'don't think that makes me seem a little..."
Ross	 ...desperate, needy, pathetic?'
Chandler	 Ah, you obviously saw my personal ad.'
Phoebe	 How many beeps?'
Chandler	 She answered.'
Monica	 Y'see, this is where you'd use that 'hello' word we talked about."
Chandler	 I'm not gonna talk to her, she obviously got my message and is\nchoosing not to call me. Now I'm needy and snubbed. God, I miss just being needy."
All	 Hey! Hi!'
Phoebe	 How'd he take it?"
Rachel	 Pretty well, actually... (Wandering into the kitchen.)'
Monica	 (wandering in after her) Uh, Rach... how come you have dental floss in\nyour hair?'
Rachel	 Oh, do I?'
Monica	 Uh huh.'
Rachel	 (in a low voice) We ended up having sex in his chair.'
Monica	 You had sex in his chair?!... I said\nthat a little too loudly, didn't I?"
Ross	 You-you had what?'
Phoebe	 Sex in his chair.'
Ross	 What, uh... what were you thinking?'
Rachel	 I don't know! I mean, we still care about each other. There's a history\nthere. 'S'like you and Carol."
Ross	 No! No no, it is nothing like me and Carol!'
Rachel	 Please. If she said to you, "Ross, I want you on this couch, right\nhere, right now," what would you say? '
Chandler	 If it helps, I could slide over.'
Ross	 It's, it's, it's, uh, a totally diferent situation! It's, it's apples and\noranges, it's, it's orthodontists and lesbi- I gotta go."
Phoebe	 Where are you going?'
Ross	 (leaving) I just have to go, all right? Do I need a reason? Huh? I mean I\nhave things to do with my life, I have a jam packed schedule, and I am late- for keeping\nup with it. Okay?'
Chandler	 Hello? Hello?'
Rachel	 (on phone) Hello?(Listens) Mindy! Hi! Hey, how are you? (Listens) Yes,\nyes, I've heard, congratulations, that is so great. (Listens) Really? (Listens) Oh.\n(Listens) Okay. Okay, well I'm working tomorrow, but if you want you can, you can, you can\ncome by and... (Listens) Okay... (Listens) Great... (Listens) Great... (Listens) All\nright, so I'll, so I'll see you tomorrow! (Listens) Okay.. (Listens) Okay... (Listens)\nBye. (Hangs up and sits down heavily.) Oh God. Oh God. Oh God."
Chandler	 So how's Mindy?"
Rachel	 Oh, she wants to see me tomorrow...Oh, she sounded really weird, I gotta\ncall Barry... (Does so, on phone) Hi, it's me, I just.. Mindy!! Mindy! Hi! No, I figured\nthat's where you'd be!"

Monica	 Brrrrrrr!'
Chandler	 Hell is filled with people like you.'
Joey	 (entering) He's back! The peeper's back!"
Joey	 (ducking) Get down!'
Rachel	 Get down?'
Chandler	 ...And boogie!'
Rachel	 Thanks, but I gotta go to work and get my eyes scratched out by Mindy.'
Monica	 Relax. Y'know, she may not even know."
Rachel	 Please. I haven't heard from her in seven months, and now she calls me?\nI mean, what else is it about? Oh! She was my best friend, you guys! We went to camp\ntogether... she taught me how to kiss.."
Joey	 (intrigued) Yeah?'
Rachel	 And now, y'know, I'm like... I'm like the other woman! I feel so.."
Joey	 ..Naughty!'
Rachel	 Right, I'll see you guys later..."
Joey	 Oh, hold up, I'll walk out with you. Now, Rach, when she taught you to\nkiss, you were at camp, and.. were you wearing any kinda little uniform, or- (Rachel exits\nand slams the door in his face.) That's fine, yeah..."
Chandler	 Okay, I'm gonna go to the bathroom. Will you watch my phone?"
Monica	 Why don't you just take it with you?"
Chandler	 Hey, we haven't been on a second date, she needs to hear me pee?"
Monica	 Why don't you just call her?"
Chandler	 I can't call her, I left a message! I have some pride."
Monica	 Do you?'
Chandler	 No! (Calls) Danielle, hi! It's, uh, it's Chandler! (Listens) I'm fine.\nUh, listen, I don't know if you tried to call me, because, uh, idiot that I am, I\naccidentally shut off my phone. (Listens) Oh, uh, okay, that's fine, that's great.\n(Listens) Okay. (Puts down the phone.) (to Monica) She's on the other line, she's gonna\ncall me back. (He starts doing a little jig.) She's on the other line, she's gonna call me\nback, she's on the other line, gonna call me back..."
Monica	 Don't you have to pee?"
Chandler	 'S'why I'm dancing..."
Rachel	 Mindy.'
Mindy	 Hey, you.'
Rachel	 Hey, you.... So, what's up?"
Mindy	 Um.. we should really be sitting for this.'
Rachel	 Sure we should... So.'
Mindy	 Now, I know things've been weird lately, but you're like my oldest friend\nin the world... Except for maybe Laurie Schaffer, who I don't talk to anywhere, 'cause\nshe's all bitter now that she lost the weight and it turns out she doesn't have a pretty\nface. ....Okay, I'm just gonna ask you this once, and I want a straight answer."
Rachel	 Okay.'
Mindy	 Will you be my maid of honour?'
Rachel	 Of course!'
Mindy	 Oh that's so great!"
Rachel	 Was that all you wanted to ask me?'
Mindy	 That's all!"
Rachel	 Ohhhh!! (Mindy starts to sob.) ...What? What?'
Mindy	 That's not all."
Rachel	 Oh sure it is!'
Mindy	 Oh no, it isn't! No! I think Barry is seeing someone in the city."
Rachel	 Um, what- what would make you think that?'
Mindy	 Well, ever since we announced the engagement, he's been acting really\nweird, and then last night, he came home smelling like Chanel."
Rachel	 (draws back) Really. Mindy, if it'll make you feel any better, when I\nwas engaged to him he went through a whole weird thing too."
Mindy	 Oh God! You see, that's what I was afraid of!"
Rachel	 What? What's what you were afraid of?"
Mindy	 Okay, okay... when Barry was engaged to you, he and I...kind of... had a\nlittle thing on the side.'
Rachel	 What?'
Mindy	 I know. I know, and when he proposed to me, everyone said "Don\'t do\nit, he\'s just gonna do to you what he did to Rachel," and now I feel so stupid.'
Rachel	 Uh... Oh, Mindy, you are so stupid. Oh, we are both so stupid.'
Mindy	 What do you mean?'
Rachel	 (offers her arm to Mindy and she sniffs) Smell familiar?'
Mindy	 Oh no.'
Rachel	 Oh, I am so sorry.'
Mindy	 No me, I am so sorry...'
Joey	 (watches them for a while) Oh my.'
Ross	 Four letters
Chandler	 Ring dammit, ring!'
Ross	 Thanks.'
Joey	 (entering) Hey, you know our phone's not working?"
Chandler	 What?!'
Joey	 I tried to call you from the coffee shop, and there was no answer.'
Chandler	 (investigating) I turned it off. Mother of God, I turned it off!'
Monica	 Just like you told her you did! (Chandler glares at her.) ... Just\npointing out the irony.'
Joey	 Hey, so listen, I went across the street and talked to the doorman- I got\nthe peeper's name! Can I use the phone?"
Chandler	 Nngghhh!!!!!!!'
Joey	 (to Monica) Can I use your phone? (On phone) Yeah, the number for a Sidney\nMarks, please.'
Ross	 "Heating device."'
Phoebe	 Radiator.'
Ross	 Five letters.'
Phoebe	 Rdtor.'
Joey	 (on phone) Yeah, is Sidney there? (Listens) Oh, this is? (To the gang)\nSidney's a woman."
Monica	 So she's a woman! So what?"
Joey	 Yeah. Yeah, so what? (On phone) Look, I live across the street, (walking\nto the window) and I know all about you and your little telescope, and I don't appreciate\nit, okay? (Listens) Yeah, I can see you right now! (Listens) Hello! (Listens) If I wanna\nwalk around my apartment in my underwear, I shouldn't have to feel\nlike\xc2\x97(Listens)\xc2\x97Thank you, but... that's not really the point... (Listens) The\npoint is that... (Listens) Mostly free weights, but occasionally.."
Monica	 Joey!!'
Joey	 (on phone) Yeah, my neighbor... (Listens) Yeah, the brunette... (to\nMonica) She says you looked very pretty the other day in the green dress.'
Monica	 The green dress? Really?'
Joey	 Yeah, she said you looked like Ingrid Bergman that day.'
Monica	 (waves dismissively to Sidney) Nooo!'
Rachel	 Hey. Got a second?'
Barry	 Sure, sure. Come on... (Mindy enters) ...in...'
Mindy	 Hello, sweetheart.'
Barry	 Uh... uh... what're'you... what're'you guys doing here?"
Rachel	 Uh, we are here to break up with you.'
Barry	 Both of you?'
Mindy	 Basically, we think you're a horrible human being, and bad things should\nhappen to you."
Barry	 I'm sorry... I'm sorry, God, I am so sorry, I'm an idiot, I was weak, I\ncouldn't help myself! Whatever I did, I only did because I love you so much!"
Rachel	 Uh- which one of us are you talking to there, Barr?'
Barry	 ....Mindy. Mindy, of course Mindy, it was always Mindy.'
Rachel	 Even when we were having sex in that chair?'
Barry	 (to Mindy) I swear, whatever I was doing, I was always thinking of you.'
Rachel	 Please! During that second time you couldn't have picked her out of a\nlineup!"
Mindy	 (to Rachel) You did it twice?'
Rachel	 Well, the first time didn't really count... I mean, y'know, 's'Barry."
Mindy	 Okay...'
Barry	 (to Mindy) Sweetheart, just gimme- gimme another chance, okay, we'll\nstart all over again. We'll go back to Aruba."
Bernice	 (over intercom) Dr. Farber, we've got a bit of an emergency\nhere...Jason Costalano is choking on his retainer."
Barry	 Oh God... (Into intercom) I'll be right there, Bernice. (to Mindy) Look,\nplease, please don't go anywhere, okay? I'll be, I'll be right back."
Rachel	 Okay. Okay, we'll be here! Hating you! Did you see how he was sweating\nwhen he walked out of there? Listen honey, if I'm hogging the ball too much you just jump\nright in there and take a couple punches because I'm telling you, this feels great."
Mindy	 Yeah... I'm pretty sure I'm still gonna marry him."
Rachel	 What are you talking about?! Mindy, the guy is the devil! He's Satan in\na smock!"
Mindy	 Look, I know he's not perfect, but the truth is, at the end of the day, I\nstill really wanna be Mrs. Dr. Barry Farber, D.D.S."
Rachel	 Oh God. '
Mindy	 I hope you can find some way to be happy for me. And I hope you'll still\nbe my maid of honor...?"
Rachel	 And I hope Barry doesn't kill you and eat you in Aruba."
Monica	 You okay?'
Rachel	 Yeah.'
Monica	 Really?'
Rachel	 Yeah! Y'know, ever since I ran out on Barry at the wedding, I have\nwondered whether I made the right choice. And now I know."
Monica	 Aww... (They hug)'
Joey	 Big day.'

Joey	 All right, I'll give you this, Mr. Peanut is a better dresser. I mean he's\ngot the monocle, he's got the top hat..."
Phoebe	 You know he's gay?"
Ross	 I just wanna clarify this
Danielle	 (entering) Chandler?'
Chandler	 Danielle! Hi! Uh- everybody, this is Danielle, Danielle, everybody.'
All	 Hi. Hi.'
Chandler	 What are you doing here?'
Danielle	 Well, I've been calling you, but it turns out I had your\nnumber wrong. And when I finally got the right one from Information, there was no answer.\nSo I thought I'd just come down here, and make sure you were okay."
Chandler	 ...I'm, I'm okay."
Danielle	 Listen uh, maybe we could get together later?'
Chandler	 That sounds good. I'll call you- or you call me, whatever..."
Danielle	 You got it.'
Chandler	 Okay.'
Danielle	 G'bye, everybody."
All	 Bye.'
Phoebe	 Whoo-hoo!'
Monica	 Yeah, there you go!'
Ross	 Second date!'
Chandler	 ...I dunno.'
Rachel	 You don't know?!"
Chandler	 Well, she seems very nice and everything, but that whole thing about\nher coming all the way down here, just to see if I was okay? I mean,... how needy is that?'
