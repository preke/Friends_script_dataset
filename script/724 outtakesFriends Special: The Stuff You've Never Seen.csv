Conan	 It\xc2\x92s a tradition here on Friends after every taping for me to\nhang out with you guys, (They all laugh) talk down the episode umm\xc2\x85 The point of this\nwhole thing is what people see in America is
Jennifer	 Once and a while.'
Lisa	 From time to time.'
Conan	 For example, I don\xc2\x92t have to memorize lines. You guys actually have\nto remember what to say and you probably forget from time to time. Yes?'
Matthew	 Our energy just comes way up when there\xc2\x92s an audience here and\nwhen that happens, something happens between your brain and your mouth sometimes and it\njust doesn\xc2\x92t, it just doesn\xc2\x92t work.'
Ross	 Uh, oh-oh, umm no you didn\xc2\x92t. I did.'
Chandler	 Oh uh-uh, no-no-no-no-uh-uh. (He starts laughing, causing everyone\nelse to laugh.)'
Phoebe	 So, we realize that\xc2\x97Oh no\xc2\x85 (She resets herself) I\xc2\x92m\ntelling it! I\xc2\x92m telling it\xc2\x85 (She loses it.)'
Joey	 Ha-ha. Look\xc2\x97Come on, I don\xc2\x92t know what to do\xc2\x85or say. (He\nlaughs.)'
Joey	 Ha-ha, very funny. I don\xc2\x92t know what to do! Y\xc2\x92know? Holy crud!'
Joey	 Ha-ha-ha, very funny. Look, I don\xc2\x92t know what to do! (Long pause, as\neveryone cracks up.)'
Courtney	 It is one of those days!'
Phoebe	 \xc2\x91Xcusa seniora, voulez-bere quakay\xc2\x97[Beep]\xc2\x97uck it!'
Matt	 Wow Pheebs, you-you speak gutter?'
Conan	 You still get nervous everybody just before a show?'
Matthew	 Absolutely.'
Lisa	 Everybody.'
Courtney	 It\xc2\x92s amazing like all week long we\xc2\x92ve-we\xc2\x92ve been saying\nthe same lines and then the audience is here and we will mess up, and if you mess up once,\nthen you\xc2\x92ll get nervous because you\xc2\x92ll\xc2\x97you know you\xc2\x92ll probably mess\nup again.'
The Director	 Action!'
Monica	 (holding her hand in front of her face) When you were little you slept\nthrough-through the Grand Canyon.'
The Director	 Watch again that hand.'
Courtney	 This\xc2\x92ll be five/ten takes.'
The Director	 Okay.'
Courtney	 Okay. You know it\xc2\x92s gonna happen.'
The Director	 Once again, and action!'
Monica	 (the hand\xc2\x92s still there) When-when you were little you slept\nthrough the Grand Canyon. (She actually itches her nose this time.)'
Courtney	 Oh! Okay! I\xc2\x92m gonna try it without the coffee cup \xc2\x91cause I\nthink it\xc2\x92s the left hand that\xc2\x92s messing me up.'
Monica	 When you were little you slept through the Grand\xc2\x97(Pointing\nagain)\xc2\x97Oh fffff\xc2\x85.'
Monica	 Sorry, let\xc2\x92s go back! \xc2\x91Cause you\xc2\x92ve got more to say.'
Lisa	 Do I? Absolutely. Absolutely. Yeah, that\xc2\x92s your fault. I\xc2\x85say.'
Lisa	 I love you.'
Courtney	 I love you! (They hug.)'
Conan	 But there must be, there must\xc2\x97are a lot of moments over the years\nwhere you\xc2\x92re just trying to do your job, something goes wrong.'
Joey	 Hey and, this is a little extra something for y\xc2\x92know, always being\nthere for me.'
Matthew	 Hey Joey! The camera hit our wall!'
Matt	 What?!'
David	 Ahh! Sh\xc2\x97(Beep)\xc2\x97it that hurt!'
Jennifer	 Are you okay?'
Chandler	 Hey Rach! (She breaks up and goes back into Monica\xc2\x92s.)'
Joey	 Oh yeah? Then how come I keep\xc2\x97(He notices that the marker board they\nuse has been left on the entertainment center and holds up his discovery.)'
Monica	 It was so wild! We told \xc2\x91em we were the Gunderson\xc2\x92s in\n16\xc2\x85'
Courtney	 (laughing) I spit on her!'
Jennifer	 (to Lisa) Operation. You had a fun one.'
Lisa	 Oh yeah!'
Jennifer	 With Operation.'
Conan	 It was a little game. Yeah, with an electric buzzer.'
Phoebe	 Oh-ooh, and I brought Operation, but umm I lost the umm\xc2\x85 (It\nstarts buzzing) It\xc2\x92s making a noise.'
Lisa	 But le Blanc really doesn\xc2\x92t mess up much.'
Conan	 You don\xc2\x92t verbally mess up, but sometimes physically? You mess up.'
Matt	 I have had some clumsy moments I guess you can call \xc2\x91em.'
Lisa	 He fell down once! And we re-did it and we went back. And\nhe\xc2\x97(laughs)\xc2\x97he was afraid he was gonna fall down\xc2\x85'
Conan	 You could actually see him trying not to fall down.'
Joey	 Pheebs! (He looks down as he goes down the step to make sure he\ndidn\xc2\x92t fall again.) Check it out! (He starts laughing when he realized what he did.)'
Courtney	 This particular time when he continued to fall or y\xc2\x92know, try not\nto fall, I was in the room with Matthew and Matthew was like, "Should I do it?"'
Joey	 Pheebs! Check it out! Check it out! Check it out! Check it out! (Hands her\none.)'
Phoebe	 Ooh, Soap Opera Digest!'
Conan	 Matthew, you have a reputation with the rest of the cast that sometimes\nyou like to, you like to fool around a bit. I mean like if something\xc2\x92s naturally\ngoing wrong you like to get in there and juice it a little bit. True or false?'
Matthew	 I don\xc2\x92t necessarily like to juice things\xc2\x85'
Courtney	 He said true or false!'
Joey	 Oh! Ooh-ooh!'
Monica	 What are you doing?!'
Joey	 You\xc2\x92re still a tiny bit on fire there.'
Monica	 Oh geez! Okay! Thanks!'
Richard	 It was great seeing you the other night.'
Monica	 Well, it was good to see you too. Did you come down here to tell me\nthat?'
Richard	 Noo! I came down here to tell you something else. I came here\nto tell you I still love you.'
Chandler	 What the fu\xc2\x97(beep)\xc2\x97ck are you doing?!'
Conan	 Now you guys work with animals a lot. You had to work early on with a\nmonkey\xc2\x85'
Jennifer	 That damn monkey.'
Conan	 That damn monkey.'
Rachel	 Okay. Okay, see now the one with the feather boa? That\xc2\x92s Dr.\nFrancis. She used to be a man. Oh look! There\xc2\x97(Marcel (Katie) jumps away)\xc2\x97Okay.\n(And runs behind her on the back of the couch for a little while.) '
Jennifer	 Katie. Geez! See Katie, come here\xc2\x97Katie! (Katie spills some\npopcorn.) Katie, come here Katie. (She obeys and sits where she\xc2\x92s supposed to.) Very\ngood.'
Jennifer	 Lisa\xc2\x92s laugh though\xc2\x85There\xc2\x92s\xc2\x97It\xc2\x92s so\ninfectious. It\xc2\x92s one of those things\xc2\x85just forget about it. Once it starts,\nit\xc2\x92s all gone.'
Rachel	 No y\xc2\x92know, I don\xc2\x92t want to switch! Come on! I can throw wet\npaper towels here!'
Phoebe	 Well at Monica\xc2\x92s you can eat\xc2\x97(Suddenly cracks up.)'
Lisa	 Okay, shh yeah. \xc2\x91Cause it\xc2\x92s not silly.'
The Director	 Here we go.'
Jennifer	 Okay.'
The Director	 And\xc2\x85action!'
Rachel	 No-no Ph-Ph-Ph-Ph\xc2\x85 (She starts laughing.)'
Jennifer	 (to Lisa) Ready?'
Lisa	 Yeah.'
Conan	 And then it just builds on itself and there\xc2\x92s no doing the scene\nafter. I mean you probably wait and really get it together and do it.'
David	 For me, I have a hard time with le Blanc in particular. When-when\xc2\x97I\nmean when\xc2\x85'
Conan	 (to Matt) You bastard.'
Matt	 Yeah, what did I do?'
David	 \xc2\x85I keep a straight face he-he delivers like this look, a reaction to\nyou, or a certain take, I-I\xc2\x97I mean I find it so funny.'
Joey	 Mornin\xc2\x92'
Ross	 Mornin\xc2\x92'
Joey	 I mean what kind of an actor, what kind of an actor can\xc2\x92t even say,\n"Hmm, noodle soup?"'
Matt	 That\xc2\x92s a good one? (They both laugh.)'
David	 Now, we should go back and take the other line.'
Matt	 Okay, I\xc2\x92ll just put a little more booze on there. (Pours some more\non.)'
Ross	 I think, subconsciously\xc2\x85'
Joey	 (cracking up) Nope, you lost me.'
David	 No! Come on!'
Joey	 Okay, the next situation is for Rachel. The wedding is about to start you\nwalk into the back room and you find Monica taking a nap with Ross. (Ross lies on the\nfloor.) I\xc2\x92ll be Monica. Go! (He jumps down and cuddles up with Ross.)'
Ross	 (jumping up) No! No! No!'
Conan	 We\xc2\x92ll be right back with more Friends, less me.'
Courtney	 I\xc2\x92m doing my brother.'
Matthew	 That\xc2\x92s\xc2\x85gross.'

Conan	 You uh, you\xc2\x92ve worked with\xc2\x97They always say a performer should\nnever work with pets or children.'
Jennifer	 Aww, the kids.'
The Director	 Action.'
Rachel	 Okay. Now\xc2\x97What is my first line?'
Ben	 (prompting her) What did we agree?'
Jennifer	 Okay\xc2\x85'
David	 The good thing about the young kids though, they\xc2\x92re completely\nunpredictable. Which is a lot of fun as an actor to respond with. But there was one\nstory\xc2\x85'
Jennifer	 Oh little Ben.'
David	 Where the story was that I was anticipating that I would be around to\nhear my son\xc2\x92s first words spoken. But the scene was about that he wasn\xc2\x92t\nsupposed to be able to speak and, uh for some reason when we started doing the show\xc2\x85'
Ross	 Hi! We\xc2\x92re visiting!'
Rachel	 Yay!'
Ross	 It\xc2\x92s Ben and his Da-Da. Da-Da? Can you say Da-Da? Y\xc2\x92know, you\nmight as well say it because I told your\xc2\x85'
Ben	 Da\xc2\x85Da.'
Ross	 Can you say Da-Da? See, I\xc2\x92m gonna tell your mommies you said it\nanyway, so you might as well try\xc2\x85'
Ben	 Da\xc2\x85Da.'
Ross	 Huh?'
Ben	 Da\xc2\x85Da.'
David	 Yeah, he\xc2\x92s saying Da-Da.'
Matt	 And then sometimes during the show y\xc2\x92know but you\xc2\x92re like, the\nscene\xc2\x92s going one way but you\xc2\x92re just tempted to say something another time.\nLike, do you remember that one where Monica\xc2\x92s baking cookies in our old apartment?'
Jennifer	 She\xc2\x92s trying to intrigue us to hang out with her.'
Matt	 Yeah, she\xc2\x92s trying to waft the smell across the hall to get us to\ncome hang out in her new place, and we\xc2\x92re sitting there eating pizza and I think it\nwas you (Points to Lisa) that said\xc2\x85'
Phoebe	 What do I smell?'
Matt	 I think I was supposed to say, "I don\xc2\x92t know," and go over\nand open the door. And I went\xc2\x85'
Phoebe	 What do I smell?'
Joey	 (Pause) Sorry. (Raises his hand in shame.)'
Matt	 (everyone laughs) And then it was like four takes later before we could\nget through it with a straight face.'
Phoebe	 What do I smell?'
David	 Le Blanc.'
Phoebe	 What do I smell?'
Joey	 I don\xc2\x92t know, but it smells good. (He gets up and heads for the door\nonly to stop short and start laughing.)'
Conan	 But audiences\xc2\x97You have a live studio audience and they must love\nthat. They must love it when they see you guys playing.'
Chandler	 What are you guys doing?'
Ross	 Nothing.'
Joey	 Nothin\xc2\x92.'
Conan	 So that you will intentionally do something\nthat\xc2\x97they\xc2\x92ll-they\xc2\x92ll intentionally screw it up?'
Courtney	 Yeah!'
David	 Yeah!'
Matt	 (noticing the laughter) Why? What\xc2\x92s the matter?'
Conan	 (to Courtney) You-you\xc2\x92ve worn a fat suit on the show. And, a lot of\npeople love you in the fat suit. Do you like wearing the fat suit? Is it fun?'
Courtney	 I\xc2\x92m melting!'
Courtney	 They made me dance, in the fat suit.'
Conan	 I-I heard some of you guys talking about this earlier, but sometimes\nthere\xc2\x92s just a word that someone has to say that you\xc2\x92ll get hung up on. And\nit\xc2\x92ll just\xc2\x97the way you say the word is funny to everybody else.'
Ross	 That tastes like feet!'
Matt	 It tastes like (mimicking him in a high-pitched voice) feet!'
David	 Okay, we\xc2\x92re good.'
The Director	 Action!'
Ross	 That tastes like feet!'
Matt	 Sometimes the dialogue itself is just so funny and\nyou\xc2\x92ll\xc2\x97we\xc2\x92ll be rehearsing during the week and you\njust\xc2\x97whatever-whatever the joke is; it\xc2\x92s so funny we can\xc2\x92t get through it\nin rehearsal and just\xc2\x85'
Jennifer	 You just know.'
Matt	 You-you mentally make a flag on it and you say, "Okay show night,\nI\xc2\x92m just\xc2\x97I\xc2\x92ll never be able to get through this."'
Monica	 Are you saying that you don\xc2\x92t want to get with this?'
Chandler	 You see, I don\xc2\x92t say\xc2\x97(Starts laughing.)'
Phoebe	 (spitting the cookie out onto a napkin) Oh, sweet\nJe\xc2\x97(Beep)\xc2\x97sus! Oh! Monica, these are the (laughing) cookies they serve in hell!'
Chandler	 (noticing the woman on the screen) Whoa! She\xc2\x92s purty!'
Joey	 Oh yeah, and she\xc2\x92s really nice too! She taught me about y\xc2\x92know,\nhow to work with the cameras and smell-the-fart acting.'
Monica	 Joey?'
Rachel	 I\xc2\x92m sorry\xc2\x85'
Ross	 Excuse me, what?'
Conan	 When you have to do physical business for a scene, I mean there must be;\nthere must be a lot of funny moments when you have to physically do a task as part of a\nscene.'
David	 Yeah, Rachel, Chandler, and Ross had to try to get a couch up a\nstair\xc2\x97a very narrow New York stairwell and that was probably\xc2\x85I-I think it was\nthe hardest I\xc2\x92ve-I\xc2\x92ve laughed in my life period.'
Ross	 Pivot! (They pivot) Pivot! (They pivot) Okay, pivot! Piv-at! (He starts\nlaughing.)'
Ross	 Pivot! Piv-at! Piv-at!!'
Chandler	 Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!!'
David	 Pivat!! (In a high pitched voice) Pivat!!!'

Conan	 You\xc2\x92ve done over 150 episodes, but your favorite moments that 80\nyears from now you\xc2\x92ll be thinking about?'
Matthew	 It is when we\xc2\x92re able to crack each other up.'
Chandler	 Monica\xc2\x92s gotta have the phone in the right place\nand\xc2\x97(Frantic babbling.)'
Ross	 (To Chandler) All right! All right! All right! (To Joey) We are\nfixing it. '
David	 He\xc2\x92s gone. He\xc2\x92s\xc2\x85 '
David	 We enjoy watching each other. And I settle for watching each other\xc2\x92s\nperformance, and we like each other.'
Ross	 Oh the band\xc2\x92s ready! And well\xc2\x97I-I\xc2\x97we gotta do what the band\nsays, right? I don\xc2\x92t care about the stinkin\xc2\x92 band!!'
Conan	 Okay Friends gang, thanks for doing it.'
David	 Well thank you so much.'
Jennifer	 Thank you Conan!'
Matthew	 Well thank for coming here, it\xc2\x92s good to see you.'
Phoebe	 Thank you my babies. (Waves good-bye.)'

Monica	 Oh what are doing?!'
Joey	 You\xc2\x92re still a tiny bit on fire there!'
Monica	 I think you got it!'
Courtney	 I\xc2\x92m sorry, I messed up.'
Matt	 I\xc2\x92ll do it again and again if you want.'
Ross	 No-no! I\xc2\x92ll-I\xc2\x92ll\xc2\x85 (He takes too much and some falls out of\nhis mouth, which starts him laughing.)'
David	 That is too much!'
Matthew	 Let me start that again.'
