Ross	 What's going on?"
Rachel	 Well, my eye is a little itchy.'
Joey	 Uhhh, mine too! Yeah.'
Monica	 (To Rachel) Wow! It's really red! You should go see my eye doctor."
Rachel	 Richard? I'm not gonna go see your ex-boyfriend!"
Chandler	 Oh, Richard. That's all I ever hear, Richard, Richard, Richard!"
Monica	 Since we've been going out, I think I've mentioned his name twice!"
Chandler	 Okay, so Richard, Richard!'
Monica	 It's not Richard! Okay? It's this new guy and he's really good."
Rachel	 Well, I'm sorry I'm not going to an eye doctor!"
Ross	 Oh God, here we go!'
Chandler	 What?'
Ross	 Anytime anything comes close to touching her eye or anyone else's she like\nfreaks out. Watch! Watch! (He takes his finger and moves it towards his eye.)"
Rachel	 (flinches) Ross! Come on! That's all right! Fine--Okay, I have a weird\nthing about my eye. Can we not talk about it please?"
All	 All right, fine.'
Monica	 Hey Rach, remember that great song, Me, Myself, and I? (And on\nthe "I" part she mimics poking her eye.)'
Rachel	 (flinches again) Monica! Come on!'
Ross	 Hey, does anybody want to get some lunch? All those in favor say I? (Pokes\nhis eye)'
Rachel	 (freaks) Ross! Stop it! Come on!'
Chandler	 How much did I love The King and I? (Oh, you get the\npoint by now.)'
Rachel	 Chandler!'
Joey	 Me too! Me too! Me too! (Yeah, he does the same thing.) '
Rachel	 Just stop it! Come on!'
Chandler	 You okay there man?'
Joey	 Yeah, I got too excited!'

Ross	 All right, I gotta go. I'm taking Ben to the park."
Phoebe	 Ohh, give him a kiss for me!'
Ross	 All right, bye!'
Monica	 Bye!'
Phoebe	 Bye!'
Ross	 Later! (Exits.)'
Phoebe	 (after he's gone) I am so sorry you got caught in the middle of that. I\ndidn't mean to be so out there. I am furious with him!"
Chandler	 Wow umm, calm down.'
Phoebe	 I'm trying, but man that guy can push my buttons!"
Monica	 Why are so mad at him?'
Phoebe	 Look, I don't wanna talk about it. Okay?"
Monica	 Well, it just seems that\xc2\x85'
Phoebe	 You wanna be on my list too? Keep talking! Has anyone seem my list by\nthe way?'
Chandler	 Uh, no Pheebs. What's it look like?"
Phoebe	 Uh, it\'s a piece of paper and it says, "Ross" on it.'
Joey	 (entering, depressed) Hey. I just got off the phone with Estelle and guess\nwhat. (Pause, then very excitedly) I GOT THE LEAD IN A MOVIE!!!!!!'
Chandler	 You got the lead in a movie? That's amazing! What's the movie about?!"
Joey	 It\'s called Shutter Speed, it\'s really cool! Yeah, umm, I meet this girl\nin the subway and we fall in love in like a day, right? And then, she\ndisappears\xc2\x85 But I find out where she lives and when I get there this like old lady\nanswers the door and I say, "Where\'s Betsy?" Right? And she says, "Betsy\'s\nbeen dead for 10 years."'
Phoebe	 Ohh-oh, chilling!'
Joey	 And the best part is, we're filming in the desert outside Vegas! (To\nChandler) And you know what that means buddy!"
Chandler	 Yeah, I know that means buddy!'
Joey	 Road trip! Yeah, we can rent a car! I just have to be there by Tuesday!'
Phoebe	 Oh wait, my grandmother's dead."
Chandler	 Well, uh, we can talk about that too Pheebs.'
Phoebe	 No! No, her cab! She probably won't be using it; you can drive it to Las\nVegas."
Joey	 All right! Thanks Pheebs!'
Chandler	 Whoa-whoa-whoa, what are we going to do about my job?'
Joey	 Oh umm, not go.'
Chandler	 All right, great, road trip baby! (To Monica) This okay with you?'
Monica	 Chandler! You don't have to ask for my permission. (Quietly) You can go."
Chandler	 Thank you.'
Monica	 Hey Rach, come on! We're gonna be late for the eye doctor appointment!"
Rachel	 (entering from her bedroom) All right! Let's get this over with! Ugh!\n(She walks by the table and notices that no one is looking and accidentally on purpose\nknocks over the open cereal box.) Ohhh! No! Look what I did! (She starts walking through\nthe mess. {Also, notice the continuity error in this scene. Note the position of the box\nand dispersal pattern of the cereal before and after the camera cut.}) Oh, I mean, look at\nthis mess! I mean, we're probably gonna have to clean this up! Y'know? We're gonna have to\nreschedule!"
Monica	 No. If you thought this mess is going to bother me, you are wrong! All\nright, let's go Blinky! (She ushers Rachel out the door, but before the door fully closes\nshe sticks her head back in.) Chandler!!!! (Chandler agrees to clean up the mess.)"
Phoebe	 Oh hey Joey! What's up?"
Joey	 I can't decide which route to take to Vegas. Hey, you've traveled a lot\nright?"
Phoebe	 Yeah, I've been around."
Joey	 Okay, so-so which route should I take the northern route or the southern\nroute?'
Phoebe	 Ooh, if you take the northern route there's a man in Illinois with a\nbeard of bees. {Okay, I must protest this, I've lived in Illinois all my life and know of\nno man with a beard of bees! Wisconsin, on the other hand, might be a different story.}"
Joey	 Great! Problem solved!'
Phoebe	 But on the southern route there's a chicken that plays tic-tac-toe."
Joey	 Well, back to square one.'
Phoebe	 Oh, I know a way that you can decide! All right, I'm going to ask you a\nseries of questions and you answer as quickly as you can."
Joey	 (quickly) Yes!'
Phoebe	 Good, but wait. Okay, all right, here we go. Now I want you to relax.\nTake a deep breath. Clear your mind. (Quickly) Which do you like better peanut butter or\negg whites?'
Joey	 Peanut butter!'
Phoebe	 Which would you rather be a fireman or a swimmer?'
Joey	 A swimmer!'
Phoebe	 Who would you rather sleep with Monica or Rachel?'
Joey	 Monica. Oh\xc2\x85 huh, I always thought it would be Rachel.'
Phoebe	 No thinking! No thinking! Tie or ascot?'
Joey	 Ascot!'
Phoebe	 North route or south route?'
Joey	 North route!'
Phoebe	 Bamn! There you go! Huh?'
Joey	 Wow! That was incredible! Beard of bees, here I come!'
Ross	 (entering) Hey!'
Phoebe	 Oh, this guy again. (She ignores him.)'
Joey	 Hey man, what's up?"
Ross	 Uhh, not much. You guys want to see a movie tonight?'
Joey	 Sure, what do you want to see?'
Ross	 I don't know, umm\xc2\x85"
Joey	 Oh, I know how we can decide. Phoebe, show him your game!'
Phoebe	 Umm, no thank you. (She gets up and moves to the couch. They were at a\ntable previously.)'
Ross	 What's with her?"
Joey	 I don't know. But hey, I know we can decide. Okay, I'm gonna ask you\nquestions and you answer real quick. Okay?"
Ross	 Okay.'
Joey	 What do you like better action or comedy?'
Ross	 Action.'
Joey	 Who would you rather sleep with Monica or Rachel? '
Ross	 Dude, you are sick.'
Joey	 Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot you had that whole Rachel thing."
Rachel	 Oh my God! What does that thing do?'
Monica	 (looks at it more closely) Oh that's an eye removal machine."
Rachel	 All right, I'm outta here!"
Monica	 I'm kidding! I'm kidding!"
Rachel	 Hey!'
Rachel	 So were done then!'
Dr. Miller	 Almost! But first, we gotta start.'
Rachel	 Okay.'
Dr. Miller	 This is a glaucoma test.'
Rachel	 Uh-huh.'
Dr. Miller	 Sit down.'
Rachel	 Okay.'
Dr. Miller	 But your chin here. (She does so.) Now, you'll feel a small puff of\nair in each eye."
Rachel	 (jerks back from the tester) What?!'
Monica	 A small puff of air, now come on!'
Dr. Miller	 Here we go.'
Rachel	 All right.'
Dr. Miller	 1\xc2\x852\xc2\x853! (Rachel jerks back on 3.)'
Rachel	 I'm sorry. All right, I'll just stay in here this time. (Puts her head\nback.) Okay."
Dr. Miller	 Ready?'
Rachel	 Uh-huh.'
Dr. Miller	 1\xc2\x852\xc2\x85 (She flinches on 2 this time.)'
Monica	 Y'know what, I'm gonna hold her head."
Rachel	 Okay.'
Dr. Miller	 That's okay."
Monica	 Okay. (Monica backs off.)'
Rachel	 Okay. Okay!'
Dr. Miller	 1\xc2\x852! (She flinches again.) (Gives up.) Y'know what? You're\nyoung; you probably don't have glaucoma."
Rachel	 (really excited) Great!! It was very, very nice to meet you sir--Ow!\nHey! What are you doing?! Are you crazy! (He took out that thing they use to look at\npeople's retinas and looked at Rachel's when she was shaking his hand causing her to\nflinch and scream at him.)"
Dr. Miller	 Okay. You've got a small, minor infection in that left eye. I want\nyou to take these drops three times a day and you'll be as good as new."
Rachel	 Yeah, no, I don't-I don't put things in my eye."
Dr. Miller	 Okay then, I guess we'll see you back here in three months."
Rachel	 Great!'
Dr. Miller	 And I'll fit you for a glass eye."
Rachel	 Okay, just give me the damn drops! (Grabs them and storms out.)'
Monica	 Dr. Miller? (She covers her right eye and reads from the chart) P E C F\nD.'
Dr. Miller	 Very good Monica! You know where they are.'
Monica	 I sure do! (She runs over to a drawer, opens it, and grabs a lollipop.)\n(To Rachel) And you don't get one!"
Rachel	 Y'know, I-I gotta tell ya, those eye drops are a miracle. My eye is a\n100% better."
Monica	 They're still in my coat."
Rachel	 Damn!'
Chandler	 (entering) Hey!'
Joey	 Hey! You ready to go?'
Chandler	 Yeah, listen, how cold is it going to be there? Do I need a coat or\nwill all these sweater vests be enough? (Holds up 3 of them in different colors.)'
Chandler	 What?'
Monica	 I love you.'
Joey	 Man, I wish Ross was coming with us! Y'know? I'm gonna miss him!"
Phoebe	 Thanks a lot! I just got that jerk out of my mind!'
Chandler	 Hey, so where are we staying? Is the movie putting us up in a big\nhotel suite?'
Joey	 Uh no, not really. It's an independent film y'know? So we don't have a\nreal big budget. I figured I'd just stay in your room."
Chandler	 I see, but once you get your first paycheck you'll be springing a big\nhotel suite, right? I mean, lead in a movie, they must be paying you a lot?"
Joey	 Oh yeah! For every dollar Shutter Speed makes, one penny of it goes right\nin Joey's pocket."
Chandler	 So you don't get paid unless the movie makes money?"
Joey	 Did you not hear the plot of the movie? "She\'s been dead for ten\nyears." I\'m gonna be a millionaire!'
Ross	 (entering) Hey!'
Joey	 Hey!'
Ross	 I just wanna say good-bye to you guys and to see if you guys will\nplace a little bet for me, huh? Twenty bucks on black 15.'
Joey	 You got it!'
Ross	 All right!'
Chandler	 All right, bye-bye now!'
Phoebe	 Bye!'
Rachel	 Bye you guys!'
Joey	 Bye-bye!'
Monica	 I wanna say good-bye at the car!'
Chandler	 Okay!'
Joey	 Anybody want to say good-bye to me at the car?'
Rachel	 Oh honey, I'll say good-bye to you at the car if you don't mind the\npuss."
Joey	 See ya! (Walks out.)'
Rachel	 Well, wait a minute! The puss is good! It means it's healing! (Runs\nafter him.)"
Ross	 Hey Pheebs, what 'cha reading? (Phoebe ignores him) Pheebs? (Turns away)\nHello? (He sits down next to her and she moves over a bit.) Phoebe? (He moves closer and\nshe keeps moving away.) Phoe-Phoebe! (They end up hanging over the arm rest.) Come on! (He\ngrabs the magazine away from her.)"
Phoebe	 Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't see you there."
Ross	 Phoebe, are you, are you mad at me, or something? 'Cause if are please,\ntell me what it is I did!"
Phoebe	 Well, if you don't know I can't help you."
Ross	 Well, I don't know."
Phoebe	 Well, I can't help you."
Ross	 Well, whatever it is I'm-I'm very, very sorry. Okay?"
Phoebe	 Apology accepted.'
Ross	 Okay. So we're, we're good?"
Phoebe	 Uh-huh.'
Ross	 All right. (Gets up.) I'll uh, I'll see you later, okay?"
Phoebe	 (quietly) Bye, fat ass. '
Ross	 ALL RIGHT!! Phoebe now come on! Will you please tell me what it is I did\nthat mad you so mad at me!'
Phoebe	 I don't know! I don't remember!"
Ross	 Well if you can't remember, can't we just forget about this?"
Phoebe	 Oh no, I am mad at you. I know that much. But, I am sorry about the fat\nass thing. You actually have a very sweet little hiney. '
Joey	 Man, I'm getting pretty tired. You're might have to take over soon."
Chandler	 We've been driving for a half-hour, and you haven't looked at the road\nonce."
Joey	 Don't worry, it's out there! (Just then a horn honks and Joey quickly\nlooks at the road.) I think I just need lunch."
Chandler	 Yeah.'
Joey	 You wanna eat? (Pulls out the twenty) My treat!'
Chandler	 Isn't that Ross's money?"
Joey	 Yeah. Okay. Ross's treat! Where do you wanna eat?"
Chandler	 I don't know."
Joey	 Ooh, hey, I know how we can decide! All right, uh, I'm gonna ask you a\nbunch of questions and then you have to answer real fast. Okay? So uh, clear your mind\nClear it right out! Clear it out! Clear!"
Chandler	 Okay!'
Joey	 Okay, uhh, would you rather be too wet or too dry?'
Chandler	 Too dry.'
Joey	 Do you believe in ghosts, yes or no?'
Chandler	 No!'
Joey	 Is this movie gonna be my big break?'
Chandler	 No!'
Joey	 (shocked) What?!'
Chandler	 Yes.'
Joey	 Dude you said, "No!"'
Chandler	 I also said, "Yes!"'
Joey	 You don't think this is going to be a big break for me?"
Chandler	 No! (Realizes) Ahhh!!!'
Joey	 I don't believe this!"
Chandler	 Look Joe, I just, I just don't want to get your hopes up real high."
Joey	 What are you talking about?! I'm the lead in a movie!"
Chandler	 They're not even paying ya! This doesn't even sound like a real movie!"
Joey	 Y'know what? I don't need this! Okay? I don't know why you're dumping all\nover my big break."
Chandler	 Joe, I don't think this is going to be your big break."
Joey	 Is that why you're on this trip, huh? Make me feel like a loser? 'Cause if\nit is, I'll tell ya, I-I-I'd rather be alone."
Chandler	 Oh, you don't want me on the trip?"
Joey	 Not if you're gonna be like this!"
Chandler	 All right, I'll tell ya what, the next time you ask me a question like\nthat I'll lie."
Joey	 Yeah! I don't want you on the trip!"
Chandler	 All right, fine! Fine! Why don't you pull over? I'll get out right\nnow!"
Joey	 Fine! (He slams on the brakes, stopping the car on the bridge to the sound\nof numerous car horns.) Get out!'
Chandler	 You're not actually supposed to stop on the bridge."
Joey	 Get out!!'
Chandler	 All right!! (Gets out and Joey speeds away.) Wait! Wait, there's no\nsidewalk! Yeah, I'm gonna die here."

Ross	 Okay, are you mad at me because my hair gel smells?'
Phoebe	 No.'
Ross	 Are you angry at me because I said your handwriting is childlike?'
Phoebe	 No that made me feel precious.'
Monica	 Oh, I know! Umm, is it because he's always correcting people's grammar?\nWhom! Whom! Sometimes it's who!"
Ross	 Yeah? Sometimes it's\xc2\x85 (Does the fist thing.)"
Rachel	 Oh, did you beat him at a board game? He turns into such a baby when he\nstarts to lose.'
Ross	 Okay, I'm the baby. (Points at his eye.)"
Rachel	 Eh! Stop it!'
Chandler	 (entering) Hey!'
Monica	 Chandler! What are you doing here?'
Ross	 Hey!'
Chandler	 Joey kicked me out of the car on the George Washington bridge!'
All	 Why?!'
Chandler	 I don't know! He went crazy! Y'know, we were playing that game where\nyou-you ask a question and you answer it really fast."
Phoebe	 That game should not be played without my supervision. '
Chandler	 Well, I don't know what mad him so mad, y'know? All I said was that\nuh, I didn't think this wasn't gonna be his big break, that this movie wasn't going to do\nanything for him, and that uh, y'know it didn't sound like a real movie--Okay, he\nshould've pushed me off of the bridge."
Phoebe	 What's in the bag?"
Chandler	 Oh, I figured you guys would all be mad at me. So I got you some gifts\nthat I found on the side of the road. (Looks into the bag.) Who wants the teddy bear with\none leg?'
Phoebe	 I do!'
Rachel	 Okay. (She tilts her head back and squeezes the eyedropper. The only\nproblem is, it's not over her eye.)"
Monica	 Not even close.'
Rachel	 Okay, then y'know what? Help me! I need help! I can't do this!"
Monica	 Okay! All right! Let's do it!"
Rachel	 All right!'
Monica	 Sit down. (They sit down on the couch.)'
Rachel	 All right.'
Monica	 Put your head back.'
Rachel	 Yes!'
Monica	 All right.'
Rachel	 Okay.'
Monica	 Now, open your eyes.'
Rachel	 Okay, they are. (No they're not.)"
Monica	 How many fingers am I holding up? (She's not holding any up.)"
Rachel	 (thinks) Four.'
Monica	 Oh my God, I was thinking four.'
Rachel	 Really?!'
Monica	 Yes! All right, y'know what? Why don't we start with a practice run?\nOkay?"
Rachel	 Okay!'
Monica	 No drops!'
Rachel	 Great!'
Monica	 Okay.'
Rachel	 Okay.'
Monica	 On three, 1\xc2\x852\xc2\x853! (Rachel turns her head on three to avoid the\ndrops.) Now my pillow's all wet! (She was trying to fool Rachel and squeezed the\neyedropper.)"
Rachel	 Well, well, you said it was practice!'
Monica	 Then why did you move?!'
Rachel	 Because I knew you were lying!'
Monica	 All right, come here! (She gets up and drags Rachel off of the couch by\nher legs.)'
Rachel	 (as she's being dragged) What are you? Monica!! Stop it!! Oh my God!\nStop it! (Monica drags her totally onto the floor and on her back.)"
Monica	 I am going\xc2\x85 I'm going--Turn it over! (Rachel rolled onto her\nstomach and Monica rolls her back.) I'm\xc2\x85 I am going to get these drops in your eyes.\n(She is holding Rachel down with both hands and has the eyedropper in her mouth.) "
Rachel	 Oh my God! You really are freakishly strong!'
Rachel	 Monica! Stop it!'
Monica	 (spitting out the eyedropper) Damn! It's empty!"
Rachel	 Wow, y'know if Joey and Chandler walked in right now, we could make a\nfortune! (Monica is straddling Rachel and holding her arms down. In a rather risqu\xc3\xa9 pose,\nat least for primetime TV.)"
Phoebe	 Ooh that is definitely Chandler, Joey, or Ross. (Thinks) Or-or Rachel!'
Monica	 (answers the phone) Hello? (Listens.) (To Phoebe) It's Joey. (Phoebe's\nproud of herself.) (To Joey) I'm so glad you called! Chandler told me what happened.\nY'know he's really upset about it."
Joey	 (on a pay phone holding a box) Not as upset as he's gonna be when he finds\nout what I did with his sweater vests!"
Monica	 What did you do to his sweater vests?'
Joey	 Let's just say there's a well-dressed pack of dogs in Ohio. Hey Monica\nlisten is-is Phoebe there? I gotta ask her something about the car."
Monica	 Yeah, she's here. Hold on a second. (She hands the phone to Phoebe.)"
Phoebe	 Hey, dude!'
Joey	 Hey Pheebs! Listen, this wooden box keeps sliding out from under the seat.\nWhat-what is it?'
Phoebe	 Oh that's my grandma. (Joey holds the box away from him.) And thanks\nJoey she's having a really great time. (Joey is happy now.)"
Chandler	 (who has just entered) Is that Joey? Is that Joey? Let me talk to him!\nI wanna talk to him!'
Phoebe	 Okay Joey? Chandler's here, he was wondering\xc2\x85 (We hear the dial\ntone as Joey hangs up.) Okay, I guess he ran out of change."
Chandler	 Y'know, he won't even talk to me. How am I going to apologize to him\nif he won't even talk to me?"
Monica	 Well, maybe you should send him something. So that when he gets to Las\nVegas he'll know that you're sorry."
Chandler	 That's a good idea. I wonder where I could (Pause) get a basket of\nporn\xc2\x85"
Phoebe	 No, don't-don't say I'm sorry with porn!"
Chandler	 Really?'
Phoebe	 Y'know what you should send him? A cartoon of cigarettes. 'Cause that\nwhy he could trade it for protection. No. That's prison."
Ross	 (entering) Okay Pheebs, I know how we're going to figure this out. Okay,\nclear your mind and answer the first thing that comes into your head. Okay?"
Phoebe	 Uh-hmm.'
Ross	 What do you like better flora or fauna?'
Phoebe	 Fauna.'
Ross	 Who would you rather be Simon or Garfunkle?'
Phoebe	 Garfunkle.'
Ross	 Why are you mad at me?'
Phoebe	 You said I was boring--Ohh!'
Ross	 When did I say you were boring?!'
Phoebe	 Oh my God, I remember now! We were playing chess!'
Ross	 Phoebe! You and I have never played chess!'
Phoebe	 Oh, come on! Yes, remember that time on the frozen lake? We were playing\nchess, you said I was boring, and then you took off your energy mask and you were Cameron\nDiaz! (Realizes) Okay, there's a chance this may have been a dream."
Joey	 Hey-hey! Stanley! Hey-hey! You're leading man is here! Let's get to work."
Stanley	 Umm, slight change of plans. We've shut down."
Joey	 Wh-what?! Why?!'
Stanley	 It's a money thing, we don't have any."
Joey	 (laughs) You're kidding right?"
Stanley	 No.'
Joey	 What?!'
Stanley	 It-it's probably just temporary. We're hoping to get some more money\nsoon, so if could just uh, hang out."
Joey	 Uh, hang out?! How long?'
Stanley	 I don't know. A week? Maybe two? The money will turn up! People will\nalways wanna invest in movies! Hey, you're not rich are ya?"
Joey	 No!'
Stanley	 Eh, worth a shot. (Gets into his car.) Look Joey, let me know where\nyou're staying, okay? (The car peels away.)"
The Grip	 Hey pal, are you Joey Tribbiani?'
Joey	 Yeah.'
The Grip	 These got left for ya. (He hands him a bunch of helium balloons.)'
Joey	 Thanks. (The grip walks away.) (Reading the card.) Congratulations on your\nbig break. '
Monica	 (answering it) Hello?'
Joey	 (on phone from Vegas) Hey Monica, it's Joey!"
Monica	 Hey Joey! Aww, you remembered even though you're a big star!"
Joey	 Aw, come on! It'll be years before I forget you!"
Monica	 Joey, what's it like on a movie set, huh? Do you have a dressing room?\nDo you have a chair with your name on it?"
Joey	 Uh, well yeah-yeah, I've got all of that going on. Yeah, listen uh, I want\nyou to make sure you tell Chandler that he couldn't have been more wrong! Uh-oh! I gotta\ngo Monica, my uh, my sushi's here! "
Joey	 (to the family) Sorry about that. Thanks for waitin'."
Joey	 Everybody smile! (The picture is taken) Okay, thanks a lot! Enjoy your\nstay at Caesar's! We hope it's toga-rrific! (The family leaves.) Kill me. Kill me\nnow."

Ross	 Hey Rach, can you pass me the TV Guide?'
Rachel	 Yep!'
Monica	 Go!!'
Rachel	 What?!! Stop it! Stop it! Oh my God!'
Monica	 Okay! Okay! Okay! (She succeeds in getting the eye drops in and everyone\nclimbs off of Rachel.) We'll see you in about 3 to 4 hours."
Rachel	 Oh! (She's trying to recover while still on the floor.)"
