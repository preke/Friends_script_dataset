Joey	 Morning, roomie!'
Rachel	 Hey! You remembered to put clothes on this morning.'
Joey	 Fifth day's a charm."
Rachel	 Oh, Joey, it's so great to be back here. I gotta tell you, you're\n      making it so easy on me and Emma."
Joey	 Hey, it's great having you back. You know, stay as long as you want,\n      and when does she stop crying all night?"
Ross	 Hey, you're not naked! So hey, Rach, when will we expect to see you\n      tonight?"
Rachel	 Well, I'll probably be back to pick her up around six, but she's\n      in the bedroom all ready to go. But she did actually fall back to sleep,\n      so..."
Joey	 She's probably exhausted from all that adorable screaming she did\n      last night."
Rachel	 Bye!'
Ross	 Bye! Hey, I hope Emma isn't making it too hard on you."
Joey	 No, hey, it's been great."
Ross	 Yeah?'
Joey	 Yeah. And look, I just want you to know that with Rachel staying\n      here and everything, all my feelings from before are totally over, okay?\n      And even if they weren't, when you accidentally walk in on a woman using\n      a breast pump..."
Ross	 Yeah, that'll do it."
Joey	 Wow! So, how are you?'
Ross	 I'm, I'm okay. "
Joey	 Really?'
Ross	 Sure, I mean, do I wish me and Rachel living together would have\n      worked out? Of course. You know, I'm disappointed, but it's not like it's\n      a divorce."
Joey	 Well, actually it...'
Ross	 No, it's not a divorce, it is not a divorce! Anyway, I think Rachel\n      and I need to, you know, get on with our lives, maybe, maybe start seeing\n      other people."
Joey	 Wow, really?'
Ross	 Yeah, sure, why not? In fact, if you know anyone that would be good\n      for me...'
Joey	 Sure, I know lots of girls. '
Ross	 Yeah? Any names come to mind?'
Joey	 Ooh, names?'

Phoebe	 Hey.'
Joey	 Hey. I was just gonna get something to eat. You want something?'
Phoebe	 What you got?'
Joey (checks the refrigerator)	 Okay, let's see, we got strained peas,\n      strained carrots... Ooh! Strained plums. We haven't tried that yet."
Phoebe	 Goodie! Thanks. So, how is it living with Rachel again? I mean, apart\n      from the great food.'
Joey	 I'm fine, I'm fine, it's just, it's just weird what's happening with\n      her and Ross. You know, yesterday he asked me to fix him up with somebody."
Phoebe	 Oh my god, Rachel asked me if I knew anyone for her too.'
Joey	 Why are they doing this?'
Phoebe	 I don't know. They're so perfect for each other; it's crazy."
Joey	 You know what's crazy? These jars. What is it, like two bites in\n      here?"
Phoebe	 I just wish they'd realise they should be together."
Joey	 I know, I know. And when they moved back in together, I figured y'know,\n      that's where things were headed."
Phoebe	 I know. They should be a family. They should get married and have\n      more children.'
Joey	 Yes, and they should name one of their kids Joey. I may not have\n      kids; someone's gotta carry on the family name."
Phoebe	 You know what? Maybe once they start dating, and they see what's\n      out there, they'll realise how good they are for each other."
Joey	 Yeah, because it is slim pickings. I had this date last night
Phoebe	 So, what are we gonna do? Are we just gonna go ahead and set them\n      up with people?'
Joey	 I know; that just pushes them further and further apart. '
Phoebe	 Yeah. (BEAT) Oh, I know what we can do. We could set Ross and Rachel\n      up on horrible dates, so that they'll realise how good they are together."
Joey	 Ooh, that's a great plan! "
Phoebe	 Yeah, you know what the best part of it is? I get to do my "plan-laugh." (A\n      maniacal laugh follows.)'
Joey	 Shhh! Not so loud, we don't wanna wake up, uh..."
Rachel	 Hey!'
Monica	 Hey!'
Rachel	 You guys aren't doing anything tonight, are you?"
Chandler	 See, now, why would you assume that? Just because we're married?\n      I will have you know that we are very hip, happening people. Now, if you'll\n      excuse me, I have to get back to reading the obituaries."
Rachel	 I was just asking 'cause I need someone to watch Emma tonight."
Monica	 Sure, we'll do that. What are you up to?"
Rachel	 Well, Phoebe set me up on a date. '
Monica	 Oh my god.'
Chandler	 Wow.'
Rachel	 Why? What's the big deal?"
Monica	 Just figured, 'cause you and Ross are..."
Rachel	 What, slept together a year and a half ago? Yeah, I'm all set."
Chandler	 Well, I think it's great that you're going on a date, you know? I\n      mean, it sounds healthy. I mean, you have needs. Embrace your womanhood!"
Monica	 You want a job? Turn off "Oprah," and send out a resume!'
Rachel	 So I'll bring her by around seven? Is that okay?"
Monica	 Oh, it's perfect."
Rachel	 Oh, you guys are gonna have so much fun! She's at such a cute age.\n      Oh, a couple things. Now that she's eating solid food, she poops around\n      the clock. And watch out for your hair, 'cause she likes to grab it. And\n      oh, she's also in this phase where if you leave the room, she screams bloody\n      murder, but ah... Thanks, you guys. Have fun!"
Chandler (reading the newspaper)	 Suddenly I wish I was reading my own name.'
Phoebe	 Ooh, Joey. '
Joey	 Hey.'
Phoebe	 Hey. I'm so excited; I just set up Rachel with the worst guy tonight. "
Joey	 All right! Who is he?'
Phoebe	 Well, it's this guy I used to massage. And by massage, I mean hold\n      down so he wouldn't turn over and flash me."
Joey (gives a thumbs up sign)	 Okay, okay. Wait till you hear who I got\n      for Ross.'
Phoebe	 Oh, yeah.'
Joey	 She's this really boring woman. She's a teacher! "
Phoebe	 A teacher?'
Joey	 Yeah, yeah, she's really into history and foreign movies... And oh,\n      oh, she loves puzzles. Huh? Come on, who loves puzzles?"
Phoebe	 Well, Ross does. What... You're - you're ruining the plan! Joey,\n      you've - you've fixed him up with his perfect woman! "
Joey	 Oh my god, you're right! "
Phoebe	 Yeah.'
Joey	 She even reads for pleasure!'
Phoebe	 How do you even know a woman like that?'
Joey	 What? I'm not allowed to know smart women? "
Phoebe	 Joey.'
Joey	 I met her at the library. I went in to pee.'
Phoebe	 So now what do we do?'
Joey	 Well, okay, I'll - I'll just call her and tell her the date's cancelled,\n      and find him somebody else."
Phoebe	 What if we don't find him somebody else? We'll just tell her the\n      date's off, but we don't tell Ross, and he goes to the restaurant and gets\n      stood up!"
Joey	 Ooh...I hear that's bad. "
Phoebe	 Ooh, so this is great! Rachel's gonna have a terrible date, Ross\n      gets stood up, and then they'll realise how good they have it together."
Joey	 Ah, yes, The Plan! (Laughs loudly again, but he sounds more like\n      Santa Claus.)'
Phoebe	 It\'s not Santa\'s plan. No, it\'s... (Laughs the real "plan-laugh.")'
Joey	 Yeah, you know, it's not that fun."
Phoebe	 No, I think we killed it.'
Chandler	 Emma? Emma? Look at me! Well, I think I'll go downstairs for a while."
Chandler	 No, no, no, no! No, no, no, no! It's okay, it's okay. I didn't go.\n      Don't cry, it's just a bit! I'm your uncle Chandler; funny is all I have!"
Monica	 Okay, just so you know, I'm gonna be ovulating from tomorrow until\n      the sixth, so don't touch yourself in the next 48 hours."
Chandler	 I don't do that."
Chandler	 I'll try to stop. Wait, did you say until the sixth?"
Monica	 Yeah.'
Chandler	 Today is the sixth.'
Monica	 No, it's not."
Chandler	 Yes, it's also 2003."
Monica	 Oh my god. Today's the sixth?! I may be done ovulating! I may have\n      also served some very questionable meat at the restaurant."
Chandler	 It's okay. Go take the test and see if we're okay."
Monica	 Okay.'
Chandler	 Tough crib.'
Monica	 Hey, where are all my ovulation-sticks? There's only one here."
Chandler	 I might have checked to see if I was ovulating a couple times.'
Monica	 Chandler!'
Chandler	 I am not working. There's not much to do around here!"
Ross	 Excuse me, is there a woman waiting at the bar? Someone average height,\n      dark hair, perhaps doing a puzzle?'
Waiter	 Uh, there's a drunk Chinese guy."
Ross	 Well, if I'm still here in an hour, buy him a drink on me."
Waiter	 Can I get you another glass of wine? '
Ross	 Nah, I don't know if I should. I don't wanna be drunk when I go home\n      alone."
Waiter	 Got stood up, huh?'
Ross	 Yeah, it's no big deal. It's just a blind date."
Waiter	 Are you worried your date came, saw you, and left?'
Ross	 No! '
Monica	 We're okay. I'm still ovulating."
Chandler	 Oh, good, because as of four o'clock this afternoon, I am not. "
Monica	 So, let's do this."
Chandler	 I - I don't think I can."
Monica	 Come on. I know you're not eighteen anymore, but give it a minute."
Chandler	 Because of Emma.'
Monica	 Oh my god, Emma. Oh, sweetie, I forgot you were here. Oh, you're\n      right, we can't do this. We can't leave her alone."
Chandler	 Sorry.'
Monica	 Unless... Maybe we do it here. I mean, how much can she even be aware\n      of at this age?'
Chandler	 Well, she's aware when we leave the room. She may notice if we start...\n      canoodling in it."
Monica	 Canoodling?'
Chandler	 Well, I can\'t say "hump" or "screw" in front\n      of the B-A-B-Y.'
Monica	 I don't know. I mean, I guess having sex in front of a baby isn't\n      so..."
Chandler	 Horrifying? Scarring? Something people go to jail for?'
Monica	 I guess you're right."
Chandler	 You guess I'm right? When we stayed at that bed and breakfast, you\n      wouldn't have sex with me because you thought a deer was staring through\n      the window."
Monica	 But what kind of a sick bastard wants to do it in front of a deer?'
Rachel	 Wow, everything looks so good! I think I'm gonna have the chicken."
Steve (staring at Rachel)	 I - I just have to say this; you're really beautiful."
Rachel	 Oh, well, that's - that's very sweet. Thank you."
Steve	 I'm kind of funny looking. "
Rachel	 What?'
Steve	 Oh, come on, you\'re way out of my league. Everybody in here knows\n      it. Bet that guy over there\'s probably saying, "ooh, why she out with\n      him? He must be rich!" Well, I\'m not! '
Rachel (feeling awkward)	 So, what do think you wanna order? I'm really\n      excited about that chicken."
Steve	 I\'m not funny either. So, if you were thinking, "well, he\'s\n      not that good-looking, but maybe we\'ll have some laughs"... That ain\'t\n      gonna happen.'
Rachel	 Well, come on, Steve; let's not rule out nervous laughter. Hey, now\n      wait a minute. Phoebe told me that - that you owned your own restaurant.\n      That's impressive."
Steve	 I lost it. To drugs. '
Steve	 I silk-screen t-shirts now.'
Rachel	 Really? What's that like?"
Steve	 It's really fulfilling doing something you hate for no money. That's\n      right. I have no money, I'm not funny, I live in a studio apartment with\n      two other guys, and I'm pretty sure I'm infertile."
Rachel (awkward chuckle)	 Now, come on, come on, Steve. There must be something\n      that you like about yourself. '
Steve	 I do like my hair.'
Rachel	 Really? '
Phoebe	 Hello?'
Rachel	 Phoebe, it's me. I'm going to hunt you down and kill you!"
Phoebe	 Hey, Rach!'
Rachel	 This is the worst date ever. How could you set me up with this creep?'
Phoebe	 You know, you are talking about one of my dear, dear friends. '
Rachel	 I don't care! This guy is a nightmare!"
Phoebe	 Oh, right, so he gets a little crazy when he's stoned."
Rachel	 He's not stoned."
Phoebe	 Did he go out for a cigarette? '
Rachel	 Yeah, four times.'
Phoebe	 My dear, sweet Rach.'
Phoebe (to Joey)	 Well, our plan is working. Rachel is having a miserable\n      time, and Ross is just stood up somewhere at a restaurant all alone.'
Joey	 Oh, great, pretty soon they'll be back together."
Phoebe	 By the time anyone's figured out what we've done, we'll be in sunny\n      Mexico. (BEAT) Oh, wait, that's the end of a different plan."
Monica	 She's asleep. Chandler?"
Monica	 What are you doing?'
Chandler	 Emma was doing it!'
Monica	 She's asleep."
Chandler	 Ooh, she's asleep, that means we can..."
Monica	 Yes, but we have to be fast.'
Chandler (laughs)	 Okay, I'll try. And you can't make any noise."
Monica (laughs)	 Okay, I'll try. "
Joey	 Hello?'
Joey	 Emma? Hey! Hi!'
Joey	 How are ya? How are ya? Where are your babysitters, huh? Why's the\n      bedroom door closed?"
Joey	 You can't have S-E-X, when you're taking care of the B-A-B-I-E!"
Waiter	 I've got bad news. The Chinese guy left. "
Ross	 Eh, if it was meant to be, it's meant to be."
Waiter	 Look; you got stood up, who cares? We're gonna show you a good time.\n      Just sit and relax. In fact, let me bring you a crab cake appetizer on\n      the house."
Ross	 Wow, free crab cakes. Well, that's nice. Although I was hoping to\n      have sex tonight."
Waiter	 Ooh... '
Ross	 Just the crab cakes.'
Waiter #2	 What are you\n      doing? Are you trying to get him to stay? Because you can't do that."
Waiter	 Just get out of here, okay?'
Ross	 What's - what's going on?"
Waiter	 Eh, okay, the waiters have a little pool going. We have a bet on\n      how long it'll take before you give up and go home."
Ross	 What? You - you're making money off my misery?"
Waiter	 Well, if you stay till 9
Ross	 This is unbelievable. I - I have never been so insulted in my life.\n      Now, if you'll wrap up my free crab cakes, I'll be on my way."
Monica	 Well, that was weird. You were loud, and I was fast.'
Chandler	 I think we may have really done it this time.'
Monica	 Oh, I wish I didn't have to wait to take a pregnancy test."
Chandler	 You may wanna get some more of those too.'
Chandler	 Where's Emma?"
Monica	 Oh my god, where's Emma? Where's Emma?"
Chandler	 Don't ask me, I was in there canoodling you!"
Monica	 Okay, okay, I'm sure that Rachel came home early and picked up Emma.\n      You go look across the hall, and I'll call her cell."
Chandler	 Okay. (Runs out.)'
Monica	 Hey, you better hope that we're pregnant, because one way or another,\n      we're giving a baby back to Rachel."
Steve (sobbing)	 I - I can't believe I\xe2\x80\x99m crying in front of you. You must\n      think I'm so pathetic."
Rachel	 No, no, no, I admire a man who can cry.'
Steve	 Really?'
Rachel	 Don't touch my coat!"
Rachel	 Oh, sorry, it's my phone. Hello?"
Monica (on phone)	 Hey, Rach, how's it going?"
Rachel	 Oh my god, this is the worst date ever!'
Rachel (to Steve)	 Look, you know what, I'm sorry, but did you really think\n      that this was going well? (To Monica.) What's up?"
Monica	 Hey, did you stop by here?'
Rachel	 No.'
Monica	 Oh my god, then...'
Monica	 Oh, thank god! Emma, there you are!'
Rachel	 What? What do you mean, "there you are"? Where was she?'
Monica	 Oh, we were playing "peek-a-boo." She just \xe2\x80\x93 she loves\n      it when I\'m dramatic.'
Monica (to Joey)	 Why the hell did you take her?'
Joey	 Because you two were having sex!'
Monica	 No, we weren't!"
Joey	 Don't you lie to me! I could tell by Chandler's hair. (To Chandler.)\n      You are so lazy. Can't you get on top for once?"
Chandler	 All right, all right, we were. We were trying to make a baby. Monica's\n      ovulating."
Joey	 Hey! It is unacceptable that you two would have sex with Emma in\n      the next room. I'm gonna have to tell Rachel about this. "
Chandler	 No, no, no.'
Monica	 No, please don't. Please, Joey. She will kill us!"
Joey	 Hey, I gotta! Unless...'
Monica	 Unless what?'
Joey	 Unless you name your firstborn child Joey.'
Chandler	 What? Why?'
Joey	 Hey, I may never have kids, and somebody's gotta carry on my family\n      name."
Chandler	 Your family name is Tribbiani.'
Joey	 (BEAT) (Laughs.) You almost had me.'
Rachel	 Well, uh...'
Steve	 Look, I think I know the answer to this question, but... Would you\n      like to make love to me?'
Rachel	 Really, really not.'
Steve	 Eh, it's just as well. Doesn't work anyway."
Rachel	 All right, well that's good to know. Good night, Steve."
Ross	 Hey, what's wrong?"
Rachel	 I just had a rough night.'
Ross	 Oh. Crab cake?'
Rachel	 Eww!'
Ross	 Well, what happened?'
Rachel	 Oh, well, I...It's kind of weird talking to you about this, but..."
Ross	 Monica told me you had a blind date.'
Rachel	 Yeah.'
Ross	 I did, too.'
Rachel	 Oh.'
Ross	 But is it technically a date if the other person doesn't show up?"
Rachel	 Oh, oh no. Do you think she walked in, saw you and left?'
Ross	 Why does everyone keep saying that?'
Rachel	 Well, if it makes you feel any better, I wish my date hadn't shown\n      up."
Ross	 That bad?'
Rachel	 Well, he makes t-shirts for a living, and he thought it would be\n      appropriate to give me this.'
Ross	 Female body inspector? What size is that?'
Phoebe	 Now, wait a minute. So, they're gonna name their first child Joey?"
Joey	 Uh-huh.'
Phoebe	 How - how do I get them to name the next one after me?'
Joey	 It's easy, you just walk in on them having sex."
Phoebe	 Oh, so they owe me like, three Phoebes.'
Phoebe	 Oh my god! Look, it's Ross and Rachel. Oh, the plan is working."
Phoebe	 Don't, don't do the plan-laugh."
Ross	 The first date we've had in months, and they were both such disasters."
Rachel	 Oh. Huh. You know, it is weird that Phoebe would\n      set me up on a date that was awful on the same night that Joey set you\n      up on a date that didn't even show."
Ross	 Wait a minute; you don't think it was intentional? I mean, that's\n      just stupid."
Joey	 We're geniuses! Yeah, look at them, look at them, they're really\n      bonding."
Phoebe	 Oh, yeah, they're falling in love all over again."
Phoebe	 Oh, they see us! Oh, they, they look mad. Oh, they figured it out.\n      They're coming this way. Run!"
Joey	 Where?'
Phoebe	 Mexico!'

Joey	 Can you believe they're still not here?"
Ross	 I know. A double blind date, and we both get stood up. What are the\n      chances?'
Joey	 I know, I'm so bummed. Can we have our free crab cakes now?"
Waiter	 What?'
Joey	 We've been stood up. (sniffles) And we want our free crab cakes."
Waiter	 Guys, give it a rest. Nobody's betting on you tonight. Although we\n      do have a pool going to see how long it takes that guy to cry."
Steve	 I have such fat hands!'
