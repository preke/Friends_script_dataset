Chandler	 Hey'
Joey	 Hey. So where's Mon?"
Chandler	 Oh, she's at home, putting up decorations for Rachel's birthday party tonight."
Joey	 And you're not helping?"
Chandler	 I tried, but apparantly singing "I will survive" in a helium voice \n  - not helping.'
Ross	 Hey you guys!'
Joey and Chandler	 (start to sing) Hey! Happy birthday ...'
Rachel	 Shhh don't say that loud, Gunther's gonna want to hug me."
Ross	 Uh, good news everyone, we finally found a nanny. This is Molly (points \n  to Molly). Molly, Chandler, Joey.'
Joey and Chandler	 Hi.'
Molly	 Hi.'
Ross	 Ooh, somebody's getting a little fussy."
Joey	 You damn right I am, I've been waiting for a cookie for 7 minutes."
Rachel	 Ok, you know what, I'm just gonna take her outside."
Molly	 No, you stay, I'll do it (takes Emma from Rachel). "
Rachel	 OK, thank you.'
Molly	 Nice to meet you guys (to Chandler and Joey).'
Joey	 Yeah, you too.'
Rachel	 Oh, wow, Molly is just great!'
Ross	 Yeah.'
Chandler	 Yes, Bravo on the hot nanny.'
Rachel	 What? You really think she's hot?"
Chandler	 Are you kidding? If I wasn't married she'd be rejecting me right now."
Rachel	 And Joey?'
Joey	 How do you think she's doing?"
Rachel	 Am I the only one who doesn't think that she's hot? Ross?"
Ross	 Eh, I mean, I mena she's not unattractive but hot? I ...."
Rachel	 Thank you! (goes to get coffee)'
Chandler	 Now that Rachel's gone?"
Rachel	 So hot I cried myself to sleep last night. (Joey and Chandler clap their \n  hands)'
Phoebe	 Hey Mike, what's the capital of Peru?"
Mike	 Lima.'
Phoebe	 No. It starts with a "v" and ends with an "x". Helpfully \n  with a "to" in the middle.'
Mike	 You know, kinda think of it, the capital of Peru IS "vtox". \n  (opens the kitchen cabinet) Oh god! Oh!'
Phoebe	 What?'
Mike	 OK, I don't want to freak you out or anything, but I think I just saw a \n  rat in your cupboard."
Phoebe	 (relived) Oh, whew, no, that's Bob."
Mike	 What, is he your pet rat?'
Phoebe	 Well not so much a pet as, you know, an occasional visitor who \n  I put food out for, you know. Kinda like Santa. Except Santa doesn't poop on \n  the plate of cookies."
Mike	 You can't keep a rat in your appartment! They're extremely unsanitary, \n  and they transmit leptospirosis and hantavirus."
Phoebe	 What are those?'
Mike	 I don't know but they don't sound like spa treatments. You have to get \n  rid of it!"
Phoebe	 OK, fine, if it means that much to you I'll get rid of Bob."
Mike	 Thank you.'
Phoebe	 So weird, you think he's so gross and you're willing to eat his crackers. \n  (Mike throws out everything in his mouth)"
Rachel	 Hello.'
Gavin	 Hello'
Rachel	 Gavin, I just wanted to say thank you again for watching Emma \n  yesterday during the presentation. I really owe you an appology.'
Gavin	 For what?'
Rachel	 Well, when we first met, you know, I thought you were pompous \n  and arrogant and obnoxious ...'
Gavin	 Is this your first appology?'
Rachel	 No, I just mean that, you know, first impressions don't mean anything. And \n  I-I think you're a really good guy and I'm sorry that I misjudged you."
Heather	 Good morning! '
Rachel	 Hello. (to Gavin) But you know what, hey, new day, new leaf, \n  I am just really really happy ... (sees Gavin staring at Heather) I'm sorry, \n  obviously Heather's ass has something more important to say so I'll just wait \n  'till it's finished."
Gavin	 What?'
Rachel	 I was giving you an appology and you were totally checking her out!'
Gavin	 I wasn't checking her out. I'm in fashion, I was looking at her \n  skirt. Or was it pants? I didn't really see what happened below the ass area."
Rachel	 Oh wow, you are really, you're really a creep."
Gavin	 Why do you even care if I was looking at her? Are you jealous?'
Rachel	 Oh yeah, I\'m jealous. "Oh Gavin, please, please look at \n  my ass". (Gavin starts looking) Stop looking at my ass! I mean, I just \n  think you are totally inappropriate, ok? This is a work environment, she\'s your \n  subordinate.'
Gavin	 I thought it was ok when you slept with your old assistant Tag.'
Rachel	 That is totally different for two reasons. One - I didn't know \n  that you knew that. And two, I wasn't some creep staring at his ass, we had \n  a deap meaningful relationship."
Gavin	 Huh. What's Tag's last name?"
Rachel	 It was ... (can\'t remember) oh my god. He didn\'t have a last \n  name. It was just "Tag". You know, like Cher, or, you know, Moses.'
Gavin	 But it was a deap meaningful relationship.'
Rachel	 Oh, you know what - my first impression of you was absolutely \n  right. You are arrogant, you are pompous ... Morgan! Morgan! Tag's last name \n  was Morgan! Huh!"
Gavin	 It was Jones.'
Rachel	 Yeah well what are you, his boyfriend?'
Joey	 Man, I wish I had a nanny like you.'
Molly	 You mean, when you were a baby.'
Joey	 Sure.'
Monica	 Would you stop staring at her?'
Chandler	 I wasn't staring. I was leering."
Monica	 What's the big deal with her? Maybe she's attractive in an obvious kind \n  of way."
Ross	 Yeah, obvious beauty's the worst. You know, when it's right there \n  in your face. Me, I like to have to work to find someone attractive. Makes me \n  feel like I earned it."
Chandler	 Looks like Joey is doing allright with her.'
Monica	 Yeah. Hey, that was nice of you guys to back off and let Joey get the girl \n  for once.'
Molly	 (to Ross) I'm gonna take her back to the appartment."
Ross	 Ok, I'll be home right after work. Ok, by Emma-Wemma-Demma, I love you \n  - wovyou dovyou ..."
Molly	 Bye'
Monica	 They've elected me to talk to you about the baby talk - it's not so good."
Molly	 I think it's sweet. (goes to leave)"
Ross, Joey and Chandler	 Bye, Emma-Wemma-Demma.'
Rachel	 (to Joey) Hey, listen, Joey, about Molly, I really prefer if \n  you didn't go after her."
Joey	 Why not?'
Rachel	 Because it took us months to find a good nanny and I wouldn't want anything \n  to, you know, drive her away."
Joey	 So, what, you think I'm just gonna sleep with her and never call \n  her again and things are gonna get uncomfortable? (thinks about it) Yeah, sounds \n  about right."
Ross	 Come on, there are plenty of other women out thereok? Just - just \n  forget about her, ok? Just, she's off limits."
Joey	 Oh, man, why did have to go and say that for? Now that you told \n  me I can't have it makes me want her even more!"
Ross	 What are you, a child?'
Joey	 Yes!'
Ross	 Joey, come on now, for me! Please, just-just try to focus your sexual energy \n  on someone else.'
Joey	 Fine. (looks around, then focuses on Monica)'
Monica	 (to Chandler) Take me home! (they quickly leave)'
Phoebe	 Hey Mikey'
Mike	 Hey P'
Phoebe	 What are you doing?'
Mike	 Setting rat traps.'
Phoebe	 To kill Bob??'
Mike	 No, no, to test his neck strength.'
Phoebe	 No, Mike, I don't want to kill him! I thought we were just gonna \n  capture him and, and you know, set him free in the country side where he can \n  maybe meet a friendly possom and a wisecracking owl."
Mike	 Ok, ok, I'll throw away the traps."
Phoebe	 I'll find Bob, I'll get him. Bob? (starts looking) Bob! Robert! (looks at \n  cabinet under sink) Oh wait, I think I hear him. Oh - Oh my god! Bob had babies! \n  Bob's a mom!"
Mike	 Better think of a new name for him.'
Phoebe	 I don't know, I kinda like Bob for a girl."
Mike	 I don't know, I mean I'm not sure (they hear cracking voice from \n  somewhere else in the kitchen, probably a rat caught in a trap) ..."
Phoebe	 Oh my god, we killed Bob!'
Mike	 Maybe it wasn't Bob, maybe it was a mouse."
Phoebe	 Suzie? (Runs over there to check)'
Ross	 Whazzup??'
Chandler	 Seriously dude, 3 years ago.'
Ross	 Listen, can you do me a favor? I'm gonna be out today. Can you just keep \n  an eye on Joey, make sure nothing happens between him and Molly?"
Chandler	 You don't trust him?"
Ross	 Wh - No. Some woman who sounded a lot like Joey called earlier and asked \n  for her daughter, the "hot nanny".'
Chandler	 Is this really your long term plan, for me to run interference? \n  Because I could get a job any day now.'
Ross	 You do appear right on the cusp of something. Come on man, I'm \n  sure he'll lose interest in a week or two, but for now can you please just do \n  this for me?"
Chandler	 Allright, fine, but don't blame me if it doesn't work. Because you know \n  as well as I do that once Joey sets his mind on something, more often than not, \n  he's going to have sex with it."
Ross	 Well we gotta do something, ok? Nannies like her don't grow on trees. (pause) \n"
Chandler	 Picturing that tree?'
Ross	 I am, yes.'
Chandler	 Where you going, Joe?'
Joey	 For a walk.'
Chandler	 Oh. You mind if I join you?'
Joey	 Actually, that will be long. You know, I really need to organize \n  my thoughts.'
Chandler	 Your thoughts? Plural?'
Joey	 Allright, fine, I only have one thought! It's about the hot nanny, I gotta \n  see her!"
Chandler	 I'm afraid I can't let you do that, Joe."
Joey	 Now YOU'RE telling me I can't see her?? You guys are killing me! \n  She's forbidden fruit! It's like ... like she's the princess and I'm the stable \n  boy ... Why are you doing this, huh? Did Ross tell you not to let me go over \n  there?"
Chandler	 Yes, as a matter of fact he did, so I can't let you go."
Joey	 Huh. Interesting. Now there are obstacles. Hot nanny and me against the \n  world. This is the kind of stuff great novels are made of.'
Chandler	 Great novels? '
Joey	 Fine ... mediocre porn'
Gavin	 Gavin Mitchelle's office."
Rachel	 Rachel Green's office!! Give me that phone! (takes the phone) \n  Hello, this is Rachel Green, how can I help you? Uh huh ... ok then ... I'll \n  pass you back to your son (gives phone to Gavin)"
Gavin	 Hey Mom! No, that's just my secretary. (Rachel is upset)"
Rachel	 Um, excuse me Gavin, I have a question I need to ask you.'
Gavin	 Mom, I'll call you later. Yeah. (hangs up) (to Rachel) Yes?"
Rachel	 If you like looking at butts so much why don't you just go look at a mirror?"
Gavin	 Thank god you finally said that, I saw you make a note on your \n  pad three hours ago. (Rachel throws away that paper) Man, I really bug you, \n  don't I?"
Rachel	 Oh, please, I don\'t care about you enough to bug me. In fact, \n  from now on, I\'m going take the high road. And I\'m going be very very nice to \n  you, you "momma\'s boy", starting right now.'
Monica	 Hey Rach!'
Rachel	 Hi!'
Monica	 Ready for your birthday lunch?'
Rachel	 Yeah I am, I am! Oh, but first of all, Monica, I would like to introduce \n  you to my very talented colleage and more importantly my wonderful friend Gavin \n  Mitchelle. '
Gavin	 Pleased to meet you.'
Monica	 Pleased to meet you. So you're coming to Rachel's party tonight?"
Rachel	 Oh no no no no no, Gavin can't, he already has plans, most likely with his \n  mother. "
Gavin	 Well I don't mind, I'll cancel. I would never miss my secretary's birthday. \n  (leaves)"
Rachel	 Why did you invite him?? I can't stand that guy!"
Monica	 You were just being so nice to him!'
Rachel	 I was faking it! Can't you tell when I'm being fake?"
Rachel	 Hey, Mr Philips, nice suit!'
Monica	 Right there! That was so fake!'
Rachel	 Shh!'
Rachel	 (to Monica) I still can't believe you invited Gavin. Allright, he is the \n  last person I want to see."
Monica	 Oh, you're welcome for the party. I'm glad you're having a good time."
Rachel	 God, I hope he doesn't show up. Of course he's not gonna show up, the guy \n  hates me."
Monica	 Does he?'
Rachel	 What?'
Monica	 Maybe he's bothering you so much because he likes you. It's like in first \n  grade when Skippy Langwild always pushed me on the playground because he secretly \n  had a crush on me?"
Rachel	 Oh, Monica, you think Skippy liked you? Honey, all those buys had a bet \n  to see if he can knock you over.'
Molly	 (with Emma in a basinet) She's out, I'm gonna take her home."
Rachel	 Oh, ok, thank you. (Molly leaves) (to Monica) Do you see what all the guys \n  see in her?'
Monica	 Wouldn't kick her out of bed. No more Vodka for me! (put her glass down)"
Joey	 Hey Rach, so can I sing happy birthday to you now?'
Rachel	 Yeah, sure!'
Joey	 Oh ... (Starts to sing) Happy birth ... (sees Molly leaving) oh, see you \n  later (runs after Molly)'
Monica	 Hey Rach, somebody got you shoes!'
Rachel	 Oh, give me! (opens the box happily, then gets freaked and throws away the \n  box, she and Mon jump up the sofa)'
Phoebe	 Be careful, be careful! These are my rat babies!'
Mike	 Yeah. We have rat babies now.'
Rachel	 Ahhhh , you brought rats to my birthday party?'
Monica	 So this is what a stroke feels like.'
Phoebe	 I had to bring them! We killed their mother, they're our responsibility \n  now. You know, they require constant care. You should know that, Rachel, you're \n  a mother."
Rachel	 Are you comparing my daughter to a rat?'
Phoebe	 No! Seven rats! I think we should take them home, we need feed \n  them.'
Rachel	 whhh wait, you're gonna leave my party to take care of a box of rats?"
Phoebe	 Well I'm sorry Rachel, but I'm not like you, ok? Not everyone \n  can afford help. (she and Mike leave)"
Ross	 Where the hell are Joey and Molly? I asked you to watch them.'
Chandler	 (In a helium voice, holding a balloon) I'm sorry, I got a little occupied."
Ross	 We have to stop them before something happens!'
Chandler	 (still helium voice) Right behind you, big guy! (they both head for the \n  door) '
Joey	 So you see, Molly, what people don't understand is that acting is a discipline. \n  It takes a lot of hard work."
Molly	 So where did you study?'
Joey	 Oh, I didn't go to college."
Molly	 No, where did you study acting?'
Joey	 Molly ... people don't study acting ..."
Ross	 Molly, ah, do you mind giving us just a minute?'
Molly	 Sure, I'll go check on Emma."
Ross	 Thanx.'
Joey	 (upset) Will the stable boy never get the princess??'
Ross	 What do you think you're gonna do, have sex with her right here on my couch?"
Joey	 No ... the leather sticks to my ass. You know, this isn't fair. \n  What makes you think that I'm just gonna sleep with her and then blow her off? \n  Huh? Can't you guys open your minds to the possibility that I actally like her, \n  and might want something real? (pause) Look, the truth is, I haven't felt this \n  way about anyone since Rachel, ok? I didn't think I could ever love again."
Ross and Chandler	 Come on! Joe!'
Joey	 Ok (admits)'
Woman	 Hi, is Molly here?'
Ross	 Yeah, come on in. Molly?'
Molly	 (goes out of the room) Hey! Guys, this is Tabatha (they kiss on the lips \n  in a romantic way). (to Ross) I'll see you tomorrow."
Ross	 Ok ... (they leave the room, long pause) Well, uh, Joey, I guess we have \n  no problem.'
Joey	 It's like my favorite fairy tale come true! (Chandler looks at him) The \n  princess, the stable boy and the lesbian!"
Phoebe	 Ok, ok, you start preparing the formula and I start changing \n  the box and then we gotta put them straight to bed.'
Mike	 Hey, when did we become one of those couples whose lives revolve \n  around their rats?'
Phoebe	 Well, you know what, they're our responsibility now."
Mike	 Ok, fine, these rats are our responsibility. What happens when they mate \n  and there are hundreds of them?'
Phoebe	 Mate? They're all brothers and sisters."
Mike	 Yeah - not such a problem with rats. No, they\'re more of a "love \n  the one you\'re with" kind of animals.'
Phoebe	 No. (opens the box) wh - get off your sister! Oh my god, what \n  are we gonna do? We have 7 rats. So what if each of them has 7 rats? And then \n  each of those have 7 rats? That's like ... (starts counting with her fingers) \n  That's math I can't even do! What are we gonna do?"
Mike	 Well, I know this is gonna sound crazy, but, we could not let \n  the box of rats ruin our lives.'
Phoebe	 Yeah, ok. I guess you're right. Allright, so we should just give them away. \n  But to nice families, with children, and reduced fat wheat thins. They're Bob's \n  favorites. "
Mike	 It's gonna be ok."
Phoebe	 You must think I'm crazy."
Mike	 No, I think you're sweet."
Phoebe	 Good. It's just so hard, it's hard for me to ... let them go. \n  I guess it just brings back memories, you know, from ... when I gave birth to \n  my brother's triplets and I had to give them up. (Mike is shocked) I haven't \n  told you about that yet, have I?"
Monica	 Hey!'
Rachel	 Hi. Thanks for the party, honey. Should I help you clean up?'
Monica	 No way! You had your party, now I have mine! Is everything alright?'
Rachel	 Yeah, I just get a little bummed when my birthday's over."
Monica	 Well, at least you have one thing to be happy about. That jerk Gavin from \n  your office didn't show up (Gavin shows up at the balcony windows)."
Rachel	 Mmm hmm.'
Gavin	 Yeah, hey. (comes in to the balcony)'
Monica	 Oh, we weren't talking about you. No, no way to recover."
Rachel	 No.'
Gavin	 Nice party.'
Rachel	 Well, it was, and you would have seen it if you didn't showed up at (looks \n  at his watch) ... 9
Monica	 (from inside) Again, you're welcome."
Gavin	 Look, I'll just give you this and go."
Rachel	 Oh, you bought me a present! Why?'
Gavin	 Well, let me explain how birthday parties usually work. There \n  are presents, and a cake, perhaps a fourth or fifth person. Ok, I ... got you \n  the present to make up for being such a jerk to you earlier.'
Rachel	 Aww. Well, ok, well that\'s very nice. And you wrote a card (opens \n  the card). "From Gavin"'
Gavin	 I really mean it.'
Rachel	 (opens the present, it's a green scarf) Awww, awww, it's beautiful."
Gavin	 You don't mind? (puts it around her neck) Well, what do you know, it fits!"
Rachel	 See, Gavin, you're capable of being a nice guy. Why did you give me such \n  a hard time?"
Gavin	 I'm not sure."
Rachel	 Well Monica seems to think it's because you have feelings for me."
Gavin	 I do have feelings for you.'
Rachel	 You do?'
Gavin	 Yes, I feel that you are a little annoying.'
Rachel	 See? Why, Gavin, why? Right when I'm about to change my opinion \n  of you, you go and you ... (he kisses her) and you do that ... (they kiss again)"
Chandler	 (sings in a helium voice) First I was afraid, I was petrified (very happy)'
Phoebe	 (walks in) Hey'
Chandler	 (normal voice) Hi'
Phoebe	 Listen, I think I've left something here."
Chandler	 Oh, well someone left this (shows a green jacket). This is yours?'
Phoebe	 (likes the jacket) No, but I like it. I think I left one of \n  my rat babies.'
Chandler	 Oh, uh, well, I haven't seem it but if I do I'll let you know."
Monica	 Ohmygod! Rat baby! Rat baby! Rat baby! (screams from another room)'
Phoebe	 (realizes) Ooh, maybe that's him!"
