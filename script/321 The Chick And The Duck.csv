Rachel	 So who\xc2\x92s idea was it to put everybody in the diner on skates?'
Monica	 Oh, some idiot customer put a suggestion in the suggestion box.'
Phoebe	 Oh my God, they took my idea!'
Monica	 That was you?!'
Phoebe	 Yeah! Okay, here you go. (rolls her back to Rachel)'
Gunther	 (bringing Rachel a mug) Rachel, I made you a cocoa. '
Phoebe	 Oh my God, are you guys okay?'
Gunther	 Are you all right?'
Joey	 (leaving Central Perk and seeing Monica laying on top of Rachel who is\nmoaning in pain.) Oh my.'

Chandler	 (sporting a goatee) Hey.'
Joey	 Hey. Y'know with that goatee you kinda look like Satan."
Chandler	 Oh, so that\xc2\x92s why the priest threw holy water on me.\n(there\xc2\x92s no reaction from Joey) Okay, listen, you have to cheer up! Okay? You\nshould come out with Ross and me, I mean anything is better than sitting around here\ncrying all day about Kate.'
Joey	 Hey I was crying because, because nobody believed Quincy\xc2\x92s theory.\nOkay?'
Ross	 (entering) Hey!'
Chandler	 Hey.'
Ross	 (triumphantly) I\xc2\x92m gonna be on TV!!'
Chandler	 No way!'
Ross	 Yeah! They\xc2\x92re putting together this panel to talk about these fossils\nthey just found in Peru and The Discovery Channel\xc2\x92s gonna film it!'
Chandler	 Oh my God! Who\xc2\x92s gonna watch that?!'
Ross	 Thanks. You ready to go?'
Chandler	 Yeah. (they start to leave)'
Joey	 Saw a girl with that vest.'
Chandler	 Thanks. (He takes off the vest and throws it on the floor.)'
Anchorwoman	 (on TV) While most of us think of chocolate bunnies and baskets as\ntraditional Easter gifts. Some people insist on giving live chicks as presents. (Joey is\nintrigued by the idea) Unfortunately, the sad fact remains that most of these little guys\nwon\xc2\x92t live to see the fourth of July. (Joey starts to call a place to buy a little\nbaby chick) Because of as a result of improper care, they will be dead.'
Joey	 (on phone) Yeah, hi. You guys got any of those baby chicks? \xc2\x91Cause I\nwas watching this ah, commercial on TV and man, those guys are cute!'
Pete	 Hi!'
Monica	 Hi! Hey, Pete you\xc2\x92re back! Hey, check this out. (She starts to\nskate over to him)'
Pete	 Wow! Skates! '
Monica	 Wow! You\xc2\x92re a lot sturdier that Chandler. He crumpled like a piece\nof paper. So how was you\xc2\x92re trip?'
Pete	 Well... (he holds up a gift he brought her)'
Monica	 Oh, what\xc2\x92d ya bring me?! (She opens the gift) Awww, hotel\ntoiletries from Japan. Oh, these are gonna go in my permanent collection. You want some\ncoffee?'

Monica	 (popping back up) Regular or decaf?'
Pete	 Ah, which ever is closest. '
Monica	 Okay. (hands him a cup)'
Pete	 So ask me what I did today.'
Monica	 So what did you do today Pete?'
Pete	 I bought a restaurant and I would like you to be the head chef.'
Monica	 What?! Oh.(She turns around quickly and falls)'
Monica	 Can you believe he just offered me a restaurant?'
Rachel	 What a jerk! You want me to kick his ass?'
Monica	 I mean this has been like my dream since I got my first Easy Bake Oven\nand opened Easy Monica\xc2\x92s Bakery. I mean I would kill for this job. I mean I can\ntotally do this job, and God knows I paid my dues. (She removes her fake breasts) But\nPete\xc2\x92s just doing this because he has a crush on me.'
Rachel	 And you\xc2\x92re still not attracted to him at all?'
Monica	 Hmm, no. I mean how can I accept a restaurant from him? I-I-I-I\ncan\xc2\x92t. I couldn\xc2\x92t even accept a necklace from Stu Vincent in the seventh grade.'
Rachel	 Yeah, but Mon that\xc2\x92s totally different. He was you\xc2\x92re health\nteacher.'
Monica	 Oh, please. '
Monica	 What? Honey.'
Rachel	 Oh, I am, my side still hurts from when you crashed into me yesterday.'
Monica	 Oh God, I\xc2\x92m so sorry.'
Rachel	 I know. '
Rachel	 Ow!!'
Monica	 Oh God!'
Ross	 (entering, wearing a white suit with a little red bow tie) Hey, you guys!\nGuess what?'
Rachel	 (looking at the outfit) Got a job on a river boat?'
Ross	 Y'know what I didn\xc2\x92t wear this suit for a year because you hated it.\nWell, guess what? You\xc2\x92re not my girlfriend anymore so..."
Rachel	 Oh I see, so this suit is making a point.'
Ross	 Right.'
Rachel	 Now that you\xc2\x92re on you\xc2\x92re own, you\xc2\x92re free to look as\nstupid as you like.'
Ross	 (to Monica) You like it right?'
Monica	 Oh absolutely. I like it even more on you than I did on Colonel Sanders.\n(Ross starts to leave) Ross! Ross! I\xc2\x92m kidding!'
Rachel	 Yeah, come here!'
Monica	 What-what was it you were gonna tell us? '
Rachel	 Yeah. Oh! Was how you invented the cotton gin?!'
Ross	 Okay, good bye! (leaves)'
Chandler	 So um, after you put the suggestion in the box, how long did it take\nfor the roller skating thing to happen.'
Phoebe	 Umm, oh, about three months.'
Chandler	 Okay, so I guess that\xc2\x92s about ah, two weeks before the topless\nthing kicks in.'
Joey	 (entering carrying a box) Hey!!'
Chandler	 Hey!'
Joey	 I got you something! Open it! Open it!'
Chandler	 Okay. (He opens it and it\xc2\x92s a baby chick) It\xc2\x92s a chicken.'
Joey	 It\xc2\x92s cute, huh?'
Phoebe	 Whoa-whoa-whoa, you guys, do you know anything about chicks?'
Chandler	 Fowl? No. Women? Nooo.'
Phoebe	 Okay, well they are a huge responsibility, especially at this age. They\nrequire constant care. They-they need just the right food, and lot\xc2\x92s and lot\xc2\x92s\nof love.'
Joey	 Oh, well no problem there. (He picks up the chick, hugs it really tight,\nand talks to it like it\xc2\x92s a little baby.)'
Chandler	 Easy Lenny.'
Pete	 So? I mean have you thought about it?'
Monica	 Okay. Here\xc2\x92s the thing.'
Pete	 Oh no, not the thing. I hate the thing. What\xc2\x92s the thing?'
Monica	 I can\xc2\x92t do it. I\xc2\x92m sorry, I wish I could, but umm, see you\nhave these feelings for me....'
Pete	 Wait, wait, wait, wait, that\xc2\x92s-that\xc2\x92s what you\xc2\x92re worried\nabout? If that\xc2\x92s the problem, we\xc2\x92ve got no problem.'
Monica	 Huh?'
Pete	 No! Look, I was gonna tell you this over dinner, but I met somebody else.\nOn my trip.'
Monica	 Oh?'
Pete	 Her name\xc2\x92s Ann, she\xc2\x92s a journalist. Ahh, we met on the plane.\nShe asked me if she could finish off my peanuts, I thought she said something else, we had\na big laugh. Yeah, I just, I mean I got, I got tired of waiting.'
Monica	 Oh, that\xc2\x92s great! I mean I\xc2\x92m-I\xc2\x92m sorry, but I\xc2\x92m so\nhappy for you. And now I can work for you!'
Pete	 I guess you can.'
Monica	 Oh my God! Oh, this is incredible! Ohh! (she rolls over and kisses him\non the cheek) All right, y'know what? I\xc2\x92m just gonna roll right into that office\nand-and quit!"
Pete	 All right.'
Monica	 Okay. (she gets ready to go) Can you give me a little push?'
Pete	 Yeah, sure. Good luck!'
Monica	 (rolling towards the office) I\xc2\x92m quitting!! Woo-hoo! (She rolls\nthrough a doorway and out of sight. We then hear a big crash, and see Monica roll past the\ndoor the other way.) I\xc2\x92m okay!! I\xc2\x92m all right!!'
Phoebe	 (to Pete) Wow! That\xc2\x92s exciting, you went to Japan, made up a woman.'
Pete	 What?'
Phoebe	 I\xc2\x92m just saying, this woman, I mean she\xc2\x92s fictitious. No?'
Pete	 Why would you say that?'
Phoebe	 \xc2\x91Cause you\xc2\x92re still into Monica. So you told her there was\nsomebody else so she would agree to work with you, so \xc2\x91cause you figure oh if you\nspent a lot of time together, maybe something might happen, and...'
Pete	 You\xc2\x92re good. You\xc2\x92re good!'
Phoebe	 Yeah, no, I\xc2\x92m fairly intuitive and psychic. It\xc2\x92s a substantial\ngift.'
Pete	 Listen, can you promise me that you won\xc2\x92t tell her though?'
Phoebe	 Absolutely, oh I promise. Tell her what?'
Pete	 Thanks a lot.'
Phoebe	 No I\xc2\x92m serious. I mean I\xc2\x92m intuitive, but my memory sucks.'
Chandler	 Okay, but this is the last time. (singing) With a chick-chick here,\nand a chick-chick there. Here a chick, there a chick, everywhere a chick-chick-(Joey\nenters)-chickeeeen.'
Joey	 Hey.'
Chandler	 Hey.'
Joey	 How\xc2\x92s she doing?'
Chandler	 She?'
Joey	 Well yeah, don\xc2\x92t-don\xc2\x92t you think it\xc2\x92s a she?'
Chandler	 I don\xc2\x92t know. (He picks the chick up and turns it over, trying to\ndetermine the sex of the chick, and blows on it.) I can\xc2\x92t tell, what ever it was went\nback in too quickly.'
Joey	 Well, anyway, I got to go change, I\xc2\x92m ah, meeting some of the cast\nfor drinks.'
Chandler	 Excuse me?'
Joey	 What?'
Chandler	 I stayed home from work today while you were at rehearsal so somebody\ncould be here with our chick!'
Joey	 Hey! Who was up from 2 o\xc2\x92clock this morning until 5 o\xc2\x92clock this\nmorning trying to get her back to sleep?'
Chandler	 You don\xc2\x92t think I get up when you get up?'
Joey	 Ohhh, here it comes.'
Chandler	 Yes, here it comes! I\xc2\x92m stuck here all day, and then you come in\nand spend two seconds with us and then expect to go off gallivanting with your friends?\nWell I don\xc2\x92t think so mister!'
Joey	 Hey!! I need to relax! Okay? I was working all day!'
Chandler	 And you don\xc2\x92t think taking care of our chick is work?'
Joey	 That\xc2\x92s not what I said. Okay, I just meant...'
Chandler	 I know what you meant!! (pause) You notice that ever since we got this\nchick, we\xc2\x92ve been fighting a lot more than we used too?'
Joey	 I don\xc2\x92t know, maybe we weren\xc2\x92t ready to have a chick.'
Chandler	 I\xc2\x92ll take her back tomorrow.'
Joey	 Do you think we\xc2\x92ll get our three bucks back?'
Ross	 (entering carrying a garment bag) Hey!'
Chandler	 Hey!'
Ross	 (sees the chick) Ohhh, hey! All right, listen, I-I have that TV thing in\nlike two hours, and I need your help, okay? What do you think? (takes out two suits) This\nblue suit, or this brown one?'
Joey	 Well, the brown one brings out your eyes, but your butt looks great in the\nblue one.'
Ross	 Really? (Joey gives him a \xc2\x91Like I would know\xc2\x92 look)'
Rachel	 (she reaches for the bottle) Oww! (She grabs the bottle, but has trouble\nopening it. She pops the top off and aspirins fly all over the place as Ross enters.)'
Ross	 Wow! That aspirin dance really works!'
Rachel	 (She bends over to try and pick up the aspirin) Oww!'
Ross	 Oh my God, is that still...'
Rachel	 I\xc2\x92m fine, I\xc2\x92m fine.'
Ross	 No you\xc2\x92re not.'
Rachel	 Yes I am! '
Ross	 Rach!'
Rachel	 Look, I\xc2\x92m fine. Watch. (She picks up an aspirin between her toes)\nLook at that. (She lifts her leg to grab the aspirin with her hand and almost falls over.)\nWhoa-whoa!'
Ross	 (stopping her from falling) Okay, okay. Look, you have got to go to a\ndoctor! Okay?'
Rachel	 No. I have got to get ready and go to a dinner at my bosses\nhouse. It\xc2\x92s a very big deal, there\xc2\x92s a lot of people there I have to meet.'
Ross	 And I\xc2\x92m sure you\xc2\x92re gonna make a big impression. Hi! I\xc2\x92m\nRachel Green. It\xc2\x92s nice to meet you. (He lifts his leg and imitates shaking hands\nwith it, just like how Rachel was trying to pick up the aspirin with her feet.) Come on,\nyou probably have a broken rib!'
Rachel	 Well, I will go to the hospital tomorrow, it\xc2\x92ll still be broken\nthen.'
Ross	 Rach...'
Rachel	 But y'know, I could use a hand getting ready."
Ross	 Rachel...'
Rachel	 Look, either help me or go.'
Ross	 Fine. I\xc2\x92ll go.'
Rachel	 (with a hurt expression on her face) Okay, but before you go, could you\nhelp me first?'
Ross	 (He checks his watch) Sure. I\xc2\x92ll help you.'
Chandler	 (rushing in) Oh, good! Good! Do you guys know how to get a chick out\nof a VCR?!'

Rachel	 (She drops the brush) Y'know what? I cannot do this with my left hand!\nWould you please, help me with this too?"
Ross	 Ohh. (He drops the shoes, takes the brush from her, and licks the tip. He\ndoesn\xc2\x92t like how it tastes.)'
Rachel	 (taking the brush back) Okay. Let\xc2\x92s use this brush. (Hands him\nanother one.)'
Ross	 Okay. This stuff? '
Rachel	 Yeah.'
Ross	 All right.'
Rachel	 Careful. Light. Okay, do you know how, just sweep it across the lid.\nOkay? Just sweep it.'
Ross	 Oke-dokey. (He pokes her in the eye with the brush.)'
Rachel	 Oh-ho!'

Rachel	 Okay, now make it even, \xc2\x91cause we don\xc2\x92t...'
Ross	 What? What?'
Rachel	 We don\xc2\x92t want it-it to be too much, we want it to be subtle.'
Ross	 No. No, y'know you don\xc2\x92t, you don\xc2\x92t wear enough of this. (Rachel\nis shocked) What?"
Rachel	 Since when, since when do you think I don\xc2\x92t wear enough of this?'
Ross	 Well I, close your eyes, I just think you\xc2\x92re gonna like this a little\nbetter, \xc2\x91cause, close-close... (He gets some more on the brush)'
Rachel	 Blow it.'
Ross	 (blows it) Sorry. \xc2\x91Cause umm, I think this will make you a little\nmore sophisticated.'
Rachel	 Sophisticated like a hooker?'
Monica	 Hey!'
Phoebe	 Hey! '
Monica	 Hey, guess what I\xc2\x92m doing tonight.'
Phoebe	 What?'
Monica	 I\xc2\x92m checking out the restaurant with Pete.'
Phoebe	 Ohh, Monica, I am so excited for you.'
Monica	 I know.'
Phoebe	 Ooh, I have to tell you something.'
Monica	 What?'
Phoebe	 But I can\xc2\x92t tell you.'
Monica	 Okay, but wouldn\xc2\x92t it be easier if you had to tell me something\nthat you could tell me.'
Phoebe	 Well, sure in a perfect world. But, no, I promised I wouldn\xc2\x92t tell,\nand I swore to like all my gods.'
Monica	 Okay. Does it have to do with Ross and Rachel?'
Phoebe	 No.'
Monica	 Does it have to do with Joey?'
Phoebe	 No.'
Monica	 Does it have to do with-with Chandler and that sock that he keeps by his\nbed?'

Ross	 (checks his watch) Sure, okay.'
Rachel	 Okay. Okay, great! Umm, okay, just turn around.'
Ross	 What?'
Rachel	 I don\xc2\x92t want you to see me naked!'
Ross	 Rachel, I\xc2\x92ve seen you naked a million times. I ate hot fudge off you\nnaked. Remember, I-I sucked that mini-marshmallow out of your belly button?'
Rachel	 Yeah, but that was different. Y\xc2\x92know? I mean, we were, we were\ngoing out then, now I think it\xc2\x92s weird.'

Ross	 Ah, I\xc2\x92m sorry.'
Rachel	 Come on! I don\xc2\x92t want you thinking of me like that any more!'

Rachel	 Thank you. (She goes to take off her make-up and screams in pain)\nOww!!!! God!'
Ross	 (rushing back in) What?! I wh-, what\xc2\x92s wrong?'
Rachel	 I\xc2\x92m sorry, I just can\xc2\x92t go to the hospital lookin\xc2\x92 like\nthis.'
Monica	 Does it involve travel?'
Phoebe	 Noo!'
Monica	 Does it involve clogs?'
Phoebe	 Oh, wait, wait. Clogs, or claws?'
Monica	 Clogs.'
Phoebe	 No.'
Monica	 Claws?!'
Phoebe	 No.'
Monica	 Okay, so it doesn\xc2\x92t involve Ross or Rachel or Chandler or Joey.\nBut, what about Pete?'
Phoebe	 (Shaking her head yes) No!'
Monica	 What is it?! What about Pete?'
Phoebe	 I don\xc2\x92t know! (frantically points at Monica)'
Monica	 Okay, I feel like I\xc2\x92m talking to Lassie. All right, Phoebe would\nyou just tell me!'
Phoebe	 I can\xc2\x92t!!'
Monica	 Okay, I gotta go. (gets up)'

Monica	 Okay, does it involve something to do with Pete\xc2\x92s computer company?'
Phoebe	 Oh, just go. You\xc2\x92re never gonna get it!'
Chandler	 I know. See, yes. That\xc2\x92s Yasmine Bleeth, she\xc2\x92s a completely\ndifferent kind of chick. I love you both. But in very different ways.'
Joey	 (entering) Hey!'
Chandler	 Hey!'
Joey	 (sees he\xc2\x92s watching Baywatch) Ohhh. (sees he still has the\nchick) Ahh! What are you doing?! I thought you were gonna take her back to the store\ntoday.'
Chandler	 I did! But the store wouldn\xc2\x92t take her back! So then I took her\nto the shelter, and you know what I found out? '
Chandler	 If they can\xc2\x92t find a home for her, they kill her! And I\xc2\x92m\nnot gonna let that happen to little Yasmine!'
Joey	 Okay, good, good, good, \xc2\x91cause, good, \xc2\x91cause I was kinda having\nsecond thoughts too. '
Chandler	 Okay. And it\xc2\x92s not just chicks y'know? It\xc2\x92s all kinds of\nother animals!"
Joey	 That\xc2\x92s horrible! Well, you did the right thing man.'
Chandler	 Thanks, I\xc2\x92m glad you see it that way.'
Chandler	 Ohhh-hoo, funny story!'
Monica	 I don\xc2\x92t believe this! Wow, look at this refrigerator! It\xc2\x92s\ngigantic! I mean I could live in this thing! I\xc2\x92d be cold, but I\xc2\x92m always cold.\nOh my God, look at these spider burners! I love spider burners.'
Pete	 So you like it?'
Monica	 Oh, it is sooo perfect. Thank you so much. (runs over and hugs him)'
Pete	 Oh, you\xc2\x92re welcome. (He takes a deep breath)'
Monica	 Did you just smell my hair?'
Pete	 Nooo. Uh-huh, no way. What? No.'
Monica	 Oh God.'
Pete	 What?'
Monica	 You still have feelings for me don\xc2\x92t you?'

Monica	 No, it\xc2\x92s not bad. It\xc2\x92s not bad at all. It\xc2\x92s-it\xc2\x92s\nreally nice.'
Pete	 Look, the only who stands to get hurt is me. And I\xc2\x92m okay with that.'
Monica	 You may be okay about getting hurt, but I am not okay with being the one\nwho hurts you. That\xc2\x92s why I can\xc2\x92t take this job.'
Pete	 What?'
Monica	 And well, we probably shouldn\xc2\x92t see each other anymore. I\xc2\x92m\nsorry.'
Pete	 Okay, yeah. I mean... If that\xc2\x92s, if that\xc2\x92s really what you want,\nokay.'
Monica	 Okay, bye. '
Pete	 I\xc2\x92m sorry things didn\xc2\x92t work out...'
Monica	 All right shut up for a second and let me just see something. (She\nkisses him back on the lips) Oh, wow! (They then hug and kiss, very passionately.)'
Rachel	 Okay, you\xc2\x92d tell me the truth. Right?'
Ross	 Rach, you can\xc2\x92t look fat in an x-ray.'
Rachel	 Okay.'
Chandler	 Okay! Now you stay out here, and you think about what you did!!'
Ross	 (to Chandler) That\xc2\x92s a duck.'
Chandler	 That\xc2\x92s a bad duck!!! (to Ross) How\xc2\x92d the thing go tonight,\nRoss?'
Ross	 Oh, it was, nah, well....'
Rachel	 What thing? What thing?'
Ross	 Nothing, ah there was this thing at the museum. Come on. (they go into her\napartment) Easy.'
Chandler	 (to the duck) Okay, now when you come back I hope you remember that,\nthat chick is not a toy! (He goes back into the apartment)'
Rachel	 What thing? What is this thing?'
Ross	 I was kinda, supposed to be on TV tonight for The Discovery Channel.'
Rachel	 Oh my God! '
Ross	 Yeah.'
Rachel	 Ross, why didn\xc2\x92t you tell me that?'
Ross	 Eh, \xc2\x91cause I knew that if I told you, you\xc2\x92d make me go, and I\nknew you needed someone to be with you tonight. Come on. Come on.'
Rachel	 I cannot believe you.'
Ross	 What?'
Rachel	 That is the sweetest thing, I just....'
Ross	 (breaking the silence) You should get some sleep.'
Rachel	 Okay.'
Ross	 So, I\xc2\x92ll umm...'

Joey	 What \xc2\x91cha doing?'
Chandler	 Having a swim.'
Joey	 What about the chick?'
Chandler	 Chicks don\xc2\x92t swim.'
Joey	 Are you sure?'
Chandler	 I don\xc2\x92t know. Should we try it?'
Joey	 Sure.'
Chandler	 See, I told you they don\xc2\x92t swim. (He goes to take it out)'
Joey	 (stopping him) Wait. Give him a minute.'
Chandler	 Noo! (takes him out) Oh, it\xc2\x92s okay, it\xc2\x92s okay, baby, baby,\nbaby.'
