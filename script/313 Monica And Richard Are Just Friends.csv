Monica	 (to clerk) Hi.'
Clerk	 Six dollars, please.'
Monica	 Six? I just had it for one night. It\xc2\x92s three.'
Clerk	 Eight o\xc2\x92clock is the cut-off and, (looks at his watch) aww,\nit\xc2\x92s 8
Monica	 Y'know in a weird way, you have too much power. Look, you\xc2\x92re gonna\nhave to help me out here, \xc2\x91cause I only have three."
Richard	 (standing behind her, without his moustache) I can help with that.'
Monica	 Oh my God. Richard? (turns around) Hi!'
Richard	 Hi!'
Monica	 Wow! Your lip went bald. (Richard pays the clerk) Hey, thanks.'
Richard	 So, you look great.'
Monica	 Right.'
Richard	 No you do. You... just...'
Monica	 What?'
Richard	 You\xc2\x92ve got panties stuck to your leg.'
Monica	 (removes them) That\xc2\x92s because I-I was just grabbing some things out\nof the dryer, and it\xc2\x92s static cling. Or maybe it\xc2\x92s just that God knew I\xc2\x92d\nbe running into you and saw an opportunity.'
Richard	 It\xc2\x92s good to see you.'
Monica	 It\xc2\x92s good to see you too.'

Monica	 You see that guy? He\xc2\x92s in classics now, but y'know as soon as we\nleave he\xc2\x92s going straight to the porn."
Richard	 He\xc2\x92s gonna go up to the counter with Citizen Kane, Vertigo,\nand Clockwork Orgy. (they both laugh) This is nice.'
Monica	 Yeah.'
Richard	 I missed this.'
Monica	 Me too.'
Richard	 So, you wanna get a hamburger or something?'
Monica	 Oh, um, I don\xc2\x92t know if that\xc2\x92s a good idea.'
Richard	 Oh. Look, just friends, I won\xc2\x92t grope you. I promise.'
Monica	 No, I just I think that it\xc2\x92s too soon.'
Richard	 No it\xc2\x92s not too soon, I had lunch at a eleven.'
Chandler	 Yeah, baby!'
Ross	 What are you doing?'
Chandler	 Making chocolate milk. Do you want some?'
Ross	 No thanks. I\xc2\x92m 29.'
Rachel	 (looking at her watch) Oh my God, I gotta go to work!'
Ross	 Oh sweetie, when do you think you\xc2\x92re going to get off tonight?'
Rachel	 Oh I don\xc2\x92t know honey. It\xc2\x92s gonna be really late.'
Ross	 Oh come on, not again.'
Rachel	 I know. I\xc2\x92m sorry. Look, I\xc2\x92ll make a deal with you all right?\nOkay?'
Ross	 Hmm.'
Rachel	 For every night that you\xc2\x92re asleep before I get home from work...'
Ross	 Yeah.'
Rachel	 I will wake you up in a way that\xc2\x92s proved very popular in the past.'
Ross	 Now, if you need to stay late, I want to be supportive of that.'
Rachel	 Right.'
Phoebe	 (entering, holding a pair of Roller Blades) Hi.'
All	 Hey.'
Joey	 (to Phoebe) Look at you. Since when do you roller blade?'
Phoebe	 Oh! Since tomorrow. I met this really cute guy in the park and he like\ny'know, jogs, and blades, and swims, and so y'know we made a deal that\xc2\x92s he\xc2\x92s\ngoing to teach me all sorts of jock stuff."
Ross	 And what are you going to do for him?'
Phoebe	 I\xc2\x92m going to let him.'
Ross	 Okay.'
Joey	 Cool.'
Monica	 (entering from her bedroom) Morning.'
All	 Hey.'
Rachel	 Somebody got in late last night.'
Monica	 Yeah well, I ran into Richard. '
Rachel	 When did this happen?'
Monica	 Oh, um, around 8
Phoebe	 Oh, there\xc2\x92s no such thing as an innocent burger.'
Ross	 So, are you gonna see him again?'
Monica	 Tomorrow night.'
Rachel	 Monica, what are you doing?'
Chandler	 Well, she spent the last six months getting over him, and now\nshe\xc2\x92s celebrating that by going on a date with him.'
Monica	 It\xc2\x92s not a date, okay. I\xc2\x92m just gonna teach him how to make\nlasagne for some pot luck dinner he has.'
Joey	 Well, you might wanna make a little extra, y'know you\xc2\x92ll probably be\nhungry after the sex."
Monica	 We\xc2\x92re not gonna have sex! Okay, nothing\xc2\x92s changed here. He\nstill doesn\xc2\x92t want children and I still do, so that\xc2\x92s why we\xc2\x92re just gonna\nbe friends.'
Ross	 Naked friends.'
Rachel	 (entering) Hey.'
Joey	 Hey.'
Rachel	 Do you have any ice?'
Joey	 Check the freezer. If there\xc2\x92s none in there, then we\xc2\x92re probably\nout. Are you just getting in from work? It\xc2\x92s late.'
Rachel	 Yeah, I know. I had the greatest day though, I got to sit in on the\nmeeting with the reps from Calvin Klien. I told my boss I liked this line of\nlingerie, she ordered a ton of it. How was your day?'
Joey	 I discovered I\xc2\x92m able to count all of my teeth using just my tongue.'
Rachel	 Hmm. (she opens the freezer) Umm, why do you have a copy of The\nShining in your freezer?'
Joey	 Oh, I was reading it last night, and I got scared, so.'
Rachel	 But ah, you\xc2\x92re safe from it if it\xc2\x92s in the freezer?'
Joey	 Well, safer. Y'know, I mean I never start reading The Shining,\nwithout making sure we\xc2\x92ve got plenty of room in the freezer, y'know."
Rachel	 How often do you read it?'
Joey	 Haven\xc2\x92t you ever read the same book over and over again?'
Rachel	 Well, umm, I guess I read Little Women more than once. But I mean\nthat\xc2\x92s a classic, what\xc2\x92s so great about The Shining?'
Joey	 The question should be Rach, what is not so great about The\nShining. Okay? And the answer would be
Rachel	 Okay. Ah, well we\xc2\x92ll just see about that, okay. I will read The\nShining, (she tries to take the book away from him but he doesn\xc2\x92t want to let it\ngo) and you will read Little Women. '
Joey	 All right, you got it.'
Rachel	 All right.'
Joey	 Okay.'
Rachel	 Okay.'
Joey	 Ah, now Rach, these ah, these little women.'
Rachel	 Yeah.'
Joey	 How little are they? I mean, are they like scary little?'
Phoebe	 Um, Chandler, Ross, this is Robert.'
Chandler	 Oh, hey.'
Robert	 Hi.'
Ross	 Hey.'
Phoebe	 (to Robert) You\xc2\x92ve have lipstick right here (points to her cheek).\nThat\xc2\x92s okay, it\xc2\x92s mine, we just kissed.'
Ross	 Oh.'
Chandler	 (to Robert) So ah, isn\xc2\x92t a bit cold out for shorts?'
Robert	 Well, I\xc2\x92m from California.'
Chandler	 Right, right. Sometimes you guys just burst into flames.'
Chandler	 (standing up) I\xc2\x92m up! I\xc2\x92m up, I\xc2\x92ve gotten up now!\nAnybody ah, want anything?'
Phoebe	 I\xc2\x92ll have coffee.'
Robert	 Yeah, me too.'
Ross	 Yeah, make that three.'
Chandler	 Okay Ross, why don\xc2\x92t you come with me?'
Ross	 Okay. (goes over to the counter) (to Chandler) What ah, what is the matter\nwith you? What\xc2\x92s going on?'
Chandler	 Robert\xc2\x92s coming out.'
Ross	 What, what do you mean, what? Is he gay?'
Chandler	 No. He.....he\xc2\x92s coming out of his shorts.'
Ross	 What?!'
Chandler	 The man is showing brain.'
Ross	 Are you sure? (Chandler nods
Robert	 Coffee.'
Ross	 Okay.'
Robert	 We could write it down for you?'
Ross	 No, no, that won\xc2\x92t be ah, that won\xc2\x92t be necessary (leans down\nand looks up Robert\xc2\x92s shorts, seeing Robert\xc2\x92s package.) '
Chandler	 (to Ross) Wellll?'
Ross	 Yeah, yeah, yeah!'
Chandler	 What do we do? What do we do?'
Ross	 Well, I suppose we just try to not look directly at it.'
Chandler	 Like an eclipse.'
Richard	 So when people complement me on my cooking should I, what do I say?'
Monica	 You say \xc2\x91Thank you very much,\xc2\x92 and then you buy me something\npretty. Come on, we\xc2\x92re gonna put are hands in this bowl, and we\xc2\x92re gonna start\nsquishing the tomatoes.'
Richard	 Ew, this feels very weird.'
Monica	 You touch people\xc2\x92s eyeballs every day and this feels weird.'
Richard	 Yeah, well, sure I touch them, but I spent years learning not to squish\nthem. (Monica grabs his hand in the tomatoes.) That\xc2\x92s my hand.'
Monica	 Oops.'
Richard	 Okay.'
Monica	 Gotta keep squishing.'
Richard	 Tomatoes are squishing.'
Monica	 Okay.'
Richard	 Op.'
Monica	 Oh, gosh, you got some on your shirt. '
Richard	 Yeah.'
Monica	 Hold on a second, just put a little club soda on it (does so) and it\nshould umm, be..... '
Richard	 What?'
Monica	 Umm, you\xc2\x92ve got some on your pants.'
Richard	 I\xc2\x92ll just throw them out.'
Joey	 These little women. Wow!'
Chandler	 Your liking it, huh?'
Joey	 Oh yeah! Amy just burned Jo\xc2\x92s manuscript. I don\xc2\x92t see how he\ncould ever forgive her.'
Ross	 Umm, Jo\xc2\x92s a girl, it\xc2\x92s short for Josephine.'
Joey	 But Jo\xc2\x92s got a crush on Laurie. (Ross nods his head) Oh. You mean\nit\xc2\x92s like a girl-girl thing? \xc2\x91Cause that is the one thing missing from The\nShining.'
Chandler	 No, actually Laurie\xc2\x92s a boy.'
Joey	 No wonder Rachel had to read this so many times.'
Phoebe	 Hey!'
Chandler	 Hey.'
Ross	 Hey! How\xc2\x92d the ah, basketball go?'
Phoebe	 Oh, okay, I learned how to shoot a lay-up, a foul shot, and a\ntwenty-three pointer.'
Chandler	 You mean a three pointer?'
Phoebe	 Oh, I get more because I\xc2\x92m dainty.'
Robert	 So um, is there a phone here, I can check my messages?'
Phoebe	 Yeah, in the back. You want a quarter?'
Robert	 Oh, no thanks. I always carry one in my sock. '
Joey	 (noticing Chandler) What are you doing? (he pushes Chandler back to his\nside of the couch) Get back over on your side of the... (sees Robert in all his glory)\nHello!! (to Robert) Hi, I\xc2\x92m Joey, we haven\xc2\x92t met.'
Robert	 Ah, good to meet you. Robert.'
Phoebe	 What? (the guys keep laughing.) What? You guys, what is going on? You\nnot like Robert? (the guys keep laughing.) Why are you laughing?!'
Ross	 Calm down. There\xc2\x92s no reason to get testy.'
Phoebe	 You guys!! Come on!'
Chandler	 I\xc2\x92m sorry, I\xc2\x92m sorry, it just seems that Robert isn\xc2\x92t\nas concealed in the shorts area, as ah, one may have hoped.'
Phoebe	 What do you mean?'
Robert	 Hey. (sits down)'
Phoebe	 Hey.'
Joey	 Hey Robert, could you ah, ha, pass me those cookies?'
Robert	 Sure.'
Monica	 So, how\xc2\x92d the lasagne go over? (listens) Really?! Good. So you owe\nme three pretty things. (listens) Yeah, I\xc2\x92ve been thinking a lot about you too.\n(listens) I know. It\xc2\x92s hard this whole platonic thing. (listens) It\xc2\x92s a word!'
Monica	 Yeah, I do think it\xc2\x92s better this way. (listens) Yeah, we\xc2\x92re\nbeing smart. (gets up to answer the door) (listens) Yes, I\xc2\x92m sure.(she opens the door\nand it\xc2\x92s Richard)'
Richard	 You really sure?'
Monica	 I\xc2\x92ll call you back. (starts kissing him)'

Monica	 So we can be friends who sleep together.'
Richard	 Absolutely, this will just be something we do, like racquetball.'
Monica	 Sounds smart and healthy to me. So um, just out of curiosity, um, do you\ncurrently have any other racquetball buddies?'
Richard	 Just your dad. (pause) Although that\xc2\x92s actually racquetball. You\nknow I-I do have a blind date with my sister\xc2\x92s neighbour next Tuesday.'
Monica	 Oh.'
Richard	 You want me to cancel it?'
Monica	 No! (pushes him) No! '
Richard	 Okay.'
Monica	 \xc2\x91Cause if you do that means you\xc2\x92d be cancelling it for me, and\nwe\xc2\x92re just friends.'
Richard	 Exactly. (pushes her back)'
Robert	 Hey.'
Phoebe	 Hey. Ooh! Don\xc2\x92t sit down! '
Robert	 You ready to go to the batting cage?'
Phoebe	 Yeah. And, first here\xc2\x92s a gift.'
Robert	 Oh! Wow! Hey!'
Chandler	 Stretchy pants! Why, those are the greatest things in the world! If I\nwere you I would wear them every day, every day!'
Robert	 Jeez, thank you really that is so nice. But um, to be honest, I\ndon\xc2\x92t think I can wear these, they\xc2\x92re so tight, I feel like I\xc2\x92m on display.\nI\xc2\x92m sorry.'
Phoebe	 That\xc2\x92s all right, that\xc2\x92s well, I figured.... (they start to\nleave as Joey enters.)'
Robert	 (to Joey) Hey!'
Joey	 Hey! (starts to laugh.) How\xc2\x92s it going?'
Ross	 Good.'
Joey	 Hey, Rach, how you doing with The Shining?'
Rachel	 Oh, Danny just went into room 217.'
Joey	 Oooh, the next part\xc2\x92s the best, when that dead lady in the bathtub...'
Rachel	 Oh, no, meh-nah-nah-nah, come on you\xc2\x92re gonna ruin it!'
Joey	 All right I\xc2\x92ll talk in code. (to Ross and Chandler) Remember when the\nkid sees those two blanks in the hallway?'
Chandler	 Hmmm, that\xc2\x92s very cool.'
Joey	 Oh, all blank, and no blank, make\xc2\x92s blank a blank blank. Oh no-no-no,\nno, the end when Jack almost kills them all with that blank, but then at last second they\nget away. Aww!'
Rachel	 Joey! I can\xc2\x92t believe you just did that!'
Chandler	 I can\xc2\x92t believe she cracked your code!'
Rachel	 All right, okay, Laurie proposes to Jo, and she says no, even though\nshe\xc2\x92s still in love with him, and then he ends up marring Amy.'
Joey	 Hey! Mine was by accident! All right, the boiler explodes and destroys the\nhotel, and kills the dad.'
Rachel	 Eh. Beth dies.'
Joey	 Beth, Beth dies?'
Rachel	 Um-hmm.'
Joey	 Is that true? If I keep reading is Beth gonna die?'
Chandler	 No, Beth doesn\xc2\x92t die, she doesn\xc2\x92t die. Does she Rachel?'
Rachel	 What?!'
Ross	 Joey\xc2\x92s asking if you\xc2\x92ve just ruined the first book he\xc2\x92s\never loved that didn\xc2\x92t star Jack Nicholson?'
Rachel	 No. She doesn\xc2\x92t die.'
Joey	 Then why would you say that?!'
Rachel	 Because, I wanted to hurt you.'
Robert	 (running in) Oh, there they are! I-I dropped my keys.'
Rachel	 (gasps) Oh my....'
Robert	 Got \xc2\x91em.'
Monica	 Hi.'
Rachel	 (screams and grabs a potato masher to defend herself) Sorry. I\xc2\x92m\nsorry.'
Monica	 You would not believe my day! I had to work two shifts, and then to top\nit off, I lost one of my fake boobs, (opens her coat revealing a large burn mark over her\nleft breast.) in a grill fire.'
Monica	 What are you smiling at?'
Rachel	 I\xc2\x92m sorry, I was just thinking you\xc2\x92re day could still pick up.'
Monica	 Yeah, right.'
Richard	 Hello.'
Monica	 I love this friend thing!'
Phoebe	 Listen, Robert\xc2\x92s gonna be here any second so, will one of you just\ntell him?'
Ross	 Oh.'
Phoebe	 Please, right now, no, every time I see him it\xc2\x92s like \xc2\x91Is it\non the lose?\xc2\x92 \xc2\x91Is it watching me?\xc2\x92'
Chandler	 We can\xc2\x92t tell him, you can\xc2\x92t go up to a guy you barely know\nand talk about his.... stuff.'
Ross	 He\xc2\x92s right, even if it\xc2\x92s to say something complementary. (He\nstops and thinks about what he just said.)'
Robert	 (entering) Hey! '
Phoebe	 Hey.'
Robert	 (to Phoebe) So are ready for the gym? They\xc2\x92ve got this new rock\nclimbing wall, we can spot each other.'
Phoebe	 No, I can spot you from here.'
Robert	 What?'
Phoebe	 Okay, listen Robert...'
Ross	 (to Chandler) Hey, don\xc2\x92t we have to...'
Chandler	 Yeah, we got, um-hmm.'
Phoebe	 Umm, I think you\xc2\x92re really, really great...'
Robert	 Oh God! Here we go again. Why does this keep happening to me? (spreads\nhis legs) Is it something I\xc2\x92m putting out there? Is this my fault? Or am I just nuts?'
Phoebe	 I-I-I-I-I don\xc2\x92t know, I don\xc2\x92t know what to say.'
Gunther	 (cleaning up the table) (to Robert) Hey buddy, this is a family place,\nput the mouse back in the house.'
Monica	 Ow!'
Richard	 (outside the bedroom) Really?! Well, it\xc2\x92s just like everyone\nelse\xc2\x92s apartment. It\xc2\x92s got rooms, walls, and ceilings.'
Richard\xc2\x92s Date	 Well, I just wanted to see where you lived. Now, give me\nthe tour.'
Monica	 Oh my God! Oh my God! (She frantically tries to clean up the bedroom as\nRichard starts the tour.)'
Richard	 Ah well, this is the living room.'
Richard\xc2\x92s Date	 Impressive.'
Richard	 All right. This is the kitchen.'
Richard\xc2\x92s Date	 Oh, that\xc2\x92s real pretty. Wait a minute, don\xc2\x92t I\nget to see the bedroom?'
Richard	 The bedroom. Well it\xc2\x92s pretty much your typical... (opens the door\nas Monica hides under the covers, and quickly closes the door before his date can see the\nroom.) bedroom.'
Richard\xc2\x92s Date	 We\xc2\x92re still on this side of the door.'
Richard	 Um-hmm.'
Richard\xc2\x92s Date	 Yeah, but I didn\xc2\x92t get to see it.'
Richard	 Oh shoot! Maybe next time. (yawns) Thanks for a lovely evening. (shows\nher out)'
Monica	 (still hiding under the blankets) So um, who was she?'
Richard	 Oh, (laughs) that was the blind date that I told you about, she called\nand switched it to today.'
Monica	 (still hiding under the blankets) Did you like her? And I\xc2\x92m just\nasking as a friend, because I am totally fine with this.'
Richard	 Well, you seem fine.'
Monica	 (gets up) Okay, y'know what, I\xc2\x92m not fine, I\xc2\x92m not. I mean how\ncan I be fine, hearing you come in with her, she wants to see your bedroom.... (pause)\nY'know what, what if we\xc2\x92re friends who don\xc2\x92t see other people?"
Richard	 You mean like exclusive friends?'
Monica	 Why not?! I mean this has been the most amazing week. Would it be so\nterrible? Even if we were friends who lived together. Or, maybe someday friends who stood\nup in front of their other friends, and vowed to be friends forever.'
Richard	 Wow. Y'know we\xc2\x92re back where we were. Honey, I would love to do\nall that, but nothing\xc2\x92s changed."
Monica	 That\xc2\x92s not true, you don\xc2\x92t have a moustache.'
Richard	 Okay, okay, one thing\xc2\x92s changed. But we still want different\nthings and we know how this is gonna end.'
Monica	 Y'know what, I\xc2\x92ve got to walk out of here right now, \xc2\x91cause\ngetting over you is the hardest thing that I have ever had to do. I don\xc2\x92t think I\ncould do it again."
Richard	 I know I couldn\xc2\x92t. So....'
Monica	 How \xc2\x91bout one last game of racquetball?'
Monica	 Watch the thorns!'
Richard	 (lying down) Ow!!'

Rachel	 What?'
Joey	 Beth is really, really sick.'
Rachel	 Awwww.'
Joey	 Jo\xc2\x92s there, but I don\xc2\x92t think there\xc2\x92s anything she could\ndo.'
Rachel	 Joey?'
Joey	 Yeah.'
Rachel	 Do you want to put the book in the freezer?'
Joey	 (nodding his head) Okay.'
Rachel	 Okay.'
