Ross	 Hey! '
Chandler, Joey, and Phoebe	 Hey!'
Ross	 I\xc2\x92m sorry I\xc2\x92m late, did I miss anything?'
Phoebe	 Joey stuffing 15 Oreos in his mouth. (Joey, with an obvious\nmouth full, nods yes.)'
Ross	 15? (Joey nods again) Your personal best! (Ross takes an Oreo and\nJoey mumbles, no!)'
Phoebe	 Where were you?'
Ross	 Oh, on a date. Yeah, I met this girl on the train going to a museum\nupstate.'
Chandler	 Oh, yeah! How did you meet her?'
Phoebe	 Oh, which museum?'
Phoebe	 (just Phoebe) No, answer his.'
Ross	 Okay, it was just me and her at the back of the train, and I sat near the\ndoor, so she\xc2\x92d have to pass by me if she wanted to switch cars. She was totally at my\nmercy.'
Chandler	 Were you so late because you were burring this woman?'
Ross	 No, I\xc2\x92m getting back down \xc2\x91cause she lives in Poughkeepsie. She\nseems really great, but she\xc2\x92s like totally great, but she lives two and a half hours\naway.'
Chandler	 How can she be great if she\xc2\x92s from Poughkeepsie? (laughs, at they\nall look at him) That joke would\xc2\x92ve killed in Albany.'
Joey	 Done! I did it! Heh, who\xc2\x92s stupid now? (He smiles and has cookie\nremains all over his teeth.)'

Chandler	 Hey, look at this! (Holding a newspaper) They\xc2\x92re lighting the big\nChristmas tree tonight.'
Phoebe	 Umm, that paper\xc2\x92s two weeks old. '
Chandler	 All right, who keeps leaving old newspapers in the trash?! I really\nwanted to take Kathy to this, I can\xc2\x92t believe I missed it.'
Rachel	 Hey, y\xc2\x92know, at least you have somebody to miss that stuff with! I hate\nbeing alone this time of year! Next thing you know it\xc2\x92ll be Valentine\xc2\x92s Day,\nthen my birthday, then bang!\xc2\x97before you know it, they\xc2\x92re lighting that damn tree\nagain. Ohh, I want somebody! (hearing this, Gunther moves in)\nY\xc2\x92know, I want a man!! (Gunther leaves depressed) I mean, it\ndoesn\xc2\x92t even have to be a big relationship, y\xc2\x92know, just like a fling would be\ngreat.'
Chandler	 Really?! I didn\xc2\x92t think girls ever just wanted a fling.'
Rachel	 Well, believe me, it\xc2\x92s been a long time since I\xc2\x92ve been flung.'
Joey	 Well, I know what I\xc2\x92m giving you for Christmas.'
Chandler	 Y\xc2\x92know what? There\xc2\x92s some nice guys at my office, do you\nwant me to set you up?'
Rachel	 Yeah! Wait a minute, it\xc2\x92s been a long time that I\xc2\x92ve been\nsingle. How come you never offered this before?'
Chandler	 Well, I have a girlfriend, I\xc2\x92m-I\xc2\x92m happy. So, I no longer\nfeel the need to go out of my way to stop others from being happy.'
Rachel	 Okay! No accountants. Oh, and no one from like legal. I don\xc2\x92t like\nguys with boring jobs.'
Chandler	 Oh and Ross was like what? A lion tamer?'
All	 Hey!'
Phoebe	 What\xc2\x92s wrong Mon?'
Monica	 Ohh, everybody at the restaurant still hates me.'
Phoebe	 Oh.'
Monica	 I thought I was making headway, everyone was smiling at me all day, I\nget off work and I find out that they wrote this (puts on her chef hat) on my chef\xc2\x92s\nhat. (The hat says \xc2\x91Quit, bitch\xc2\x92)'
Phoebe	 Hey, maybe they meant to write, \xc2\x91Quiet, bitch.\xc2\x92'
Rachel	 Hey, honey! What\xc2\x92s the matter? (Monica shows her, her hat.) Fine, I\nwas just trying to be nice! Whoa!'
Monica	 I mean I have not been picked on this much since kindergarten and they\nhad to bring in someone from junior high to do the see-saw with me. (Joey laughs and\nMonica glares at him.)'
Joey	 Ohhh!'
Monica	 I mean they\xc2\x92re trying to do everything they can to make me quit,\nand if there were any other job, I would. But this is something I\xc2\x92ve been waiting for\nmy whole life.'
Rachel	 Well, wait a minute, you\xc2\x92re the boss! Why don\xc2\x92t you just yell\nat them? Or, fire them?'
Monica	 I would love too, but I can\xc2\x92t! I mean I just can\xc2\x92t, you know\nthat I\xc2\x92m not good at confrontation.'
Chandler	 Hey, you know what you can do? I remember reading about this director,\nI think it was Orson Wells, who at the beginning of the movie would hire somebody, just so\nhe could fire them in front of everybody. Then they would all know, who\xc2\x92s boss.'
Joey	 Hey, Mon! I\xc2\x92m not doing anything, why don\xc2\x92t you fire me?'
Monica	 That\xc2\x92s a good idea! Wait, do you know how to waiter?'
Joey	 Good enough to get fired.'
Monica	 All right, you\xc2\x92re hired!'
Joey	 Hey! That must be why I got fired last week! Does this Orson Wells guy\ndirect Burger King commercials?'
Chandler	 (he glares at him for a while) Yes.'
Chandler	 I say, Drew! Are you seeing anybody right now? (Drew looks at him)\nOg-ee-op, I\xc2\x92m not asking for me, I\xc2\x92m\xc2\x85 I mean\xc2\x85 No, I\xc2\x92m-I\xc2\x92m\nnot gay, I\xc2\x92m not asking you out. I\xc2\x92m not-I\xc2\x92m not-I\xc2\x92m not gay!'
Drew	 I didn\xc2\x92t think you were gay. I do now.'
Chandler	 See my friend-my friend, Rachel, she wants to be set up.'
Drew	 Ahh, I just got out of a big relationship, I\xc2\x92m not looking for any\nthing serious.'
Chandler	 Oh, y\xc2\x92know what, that might be okay even if it was just kind of a\nfling, that might be all right with Rachel.'
Mike	 Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! Is this, hot Rachel, that you took to the Christmas\nparty, Rachel?'
Chandler	 (to Drew) Oh, by the way, that is her full name.'
Mike	 Oh wow! I\xc2\x92m free for her!'
Drew	 Oh, wait a second! I didn\xc2\x92t say I wasn\xc2\x92t free!'
Mike	 Hey, Chandler, why don\xc2\x92t we talk this over at the Ranger game\ntomorrow?'
Drew	 Hold on, y\xc2\x92know I just got a box of Cubans, maybe I\nbring them by your office around uh, five?'
Chandler	 Oh well, that\xc2\x92s uh, a little later than I uh, generally care to\nstay, but sure!'
Mike	 Maybe, before the game we could enjoy some eight year old some small batch\nBasel Hadens.'
Chandler	 Well, I don\xc2\x92t really know what that is, but let\xc2\x92s!!'
Phoebe	 Hey! You guys, I\xc2\x92m writing a holiday song for everyone. Do you want\nto hear it?'
Monica, Rachel, and Joey	 Yes!'
Phoebe	 (singing) Happy Chanukah, Monica! May your Christmas be snowy, Joey!\nHappy New Year, Chandler and Ross. Spin the draddle, Rachel!'
Rachel	 Pheebs, that\xc2\x92s great!'
Phoebe	 Oh, yay!'
Rachel	 But y\xc2\x92know umm, Rachel doesn\xc2\x92t rhyme with draddle.'
Phoebe	 I know but it\xc2\x92s so hard! Nothing rhymes with your stupid name!'
Joey	 What are you talking about? Lots of things rhyme with Rachel. Bagel. Mail.\nJail. Bail. Able. May-pole.'
Phoebe	 All good, thanks. (to Rachel) Do you maybe have a nickname have like a\nnickname that\xc2\x92s easier to rhyme?'
Monica	 Didn\xc2\x92t your dad used to call you Pumpkin?'
Rachel	 Oh yeah!'
Phoebe	 Pumpkin? Yeah. But did he ever call you like, Budolph?'
Chandler	 (entering) Hello, children!'
All	 Hey!'
Chandler	 (to Rachel) Have I got the 50 guys for you!'
Rachel	 Really?!'
Chandler	 Oh yeah, I just showed this a picture of you and guys were throwing\nthemselves at me! They\xc2\x92re buying me drinks! They\xc2\x92re giving me stuff! (to Joey)\nKnicks tonight?'
Joey	 Sure! Where are the seats?'
Chandler	 Wherever! I\xc2\x92ve got like 20!'
Rachel	 So, will I like any of these guys?'
Chandler	 Y\xc2\x92know what, I\xc2\x92m gonna uh, play the field just a little\nmore.'
Rachel	 Chandler!'
Chandler	 Guys are signing over their 401-K\xc2\x92s to me?'
Phoebe	 (shocked) You work with robots!!'
Chandler	 (pause) Yes. (to Rachel) Okay, there\xc2\x92s this one guy, Patrick, I\nthink you\xc2\x92re gonna like him, he\xc2\x92s really nice, he\xc2\x92s funny, he\xc2\x92s a\nswimmer.'
Rachel	 Ohh, I like swimmer\xc2\x92s bodies!'
Chandler	 Yes, and his father invented that magnetic strip on the back of credit\ncards.'
Rachel	 Op, I like credit cards!'
Chandler	 See, I\xc2\x92m not bad at this fixing up thing, huh?'
Rachel	 Well, so what does he do?'
Chandler	 Oh, he works in the Fine Foods division.'
Rachel	 Your company has a fine foods division?'
Chandler	 It\xc2\x92s a big company, I don\xc2\x92t\xc2\x97if you\xc2\x97I\xc2\x85'
Joey	 Now, wait a second! You make food and robots?'
Phoebe	 No! No, the robots just work for them.'
Monica	 (getting up) All right, I\xc2\x92m gonna go to work. Does anybody have a\nproblem with that?'
Joey	 Yeah, lady, I do! I got a problem with that!'
Monica	 You want a problem? I\xc2\x92ll give you a problem!'
Joey	 Oh, what are you gonna do? You\xc2\x92re gonna fire me?'
Monica	 You bet your ass, I\xc2\x92m gonna fire you! Thank you. '
Ross	 Oh, wow! I should get going. I-I got a date tonight.'
Chandler	 Oh yeah! With who?'
Ross	 You know that girl I told you about who lives up in Poughkeepsie?'
Chandler	 Yeah.'
Ross	 Not her. Yeah, this is someone else I meet, and I-I can\xc2\x92t decide\nbetween the two of them. Y\xc2\x92know the one from Poughkeepsie, even though she\xc2\x92s a\ntwo hour train ride away, is really pretty, really smart, and-and a lot of fun. But this\nother girl, well, she lives right uptown. Y\xc2\x92know she\xc2\x92s, well\nshe\xc2\x92s-she\xc2\x92s just as pretty, I guess she\xc2\x92s smart, she\xc2\x92s not\nfun.'
Phoebe	 If she\xc2\x92s no fun, why do you want to date her at all?'
Ross	 Well, I-I want to give her another chance, y\xc2\x92know? She lives so\nclose. And, at the end of the date, the other time, she-she said something that\nwas\xc2\x97if she was kidding was very funny. On the other hand, if she wasn\xc2\x92t kidding,\nshe\xc2\x92s not fun, she\xc2\x92s stupid, and kind of a racist.'
Joey	 (entering) Hey!'
Ross	 Hey!'
Chandler	 Hey, man!'
Phoebe	 Hey! Ooh, how was your first day working at the restaurant?'
Joey	 (checks his watch) Damn! (runs out to work)'
Joey	 (entering from the dining room) Hey.'
Monica	 Hey.'
Joey	 Hey, what happened to your fancy chef\xc2\x92s jacket? (sees there\xc2\x92s a\nburn spot on it)'
Monica	 They baked it. I can\xc2\x92t take this anymore. I\xc2\x92m gonna call a\nmeeting tonight, I\xc2\x92m gonna fire you tonight.'
Joey	 You got it! Oh-oh! (He starts patting the burned spot, which just happens\nto be over her breast.)'
Monica	 What are you doing?!'
Joey	 It\xc2\x92s still a tiny bit on fire there.'
Monica	 Thanks. (Joey\xc2\x92s still patting the burn spot) I think you got it!'
Rachel	 (entering) Chandler!! You have the best taste in men!'
Chandler	 Well, like father, like son.'
Rachel	 Patrick and I had such a great time last night! I mean I think this\ncould maybe turn into something serious.'
Chandler	 Really?! I-I thought you weren\xc2\x92t looking for something serious? I\nthought you were looking for some kind of a fling.'
Rachel	 Well, y'know, possibly. (pause) You didn\xc2\x92t tell him that, though?\nRight?"
Chandler	 Ummmmmmmm, no.'
Rachel	 You told this guy that I was looking for a fling?! You don\xc2\x92t tell\nthe guy that!'
Chandler	 Why not?! I\xc2\x92d be thrilled if I heard that some hot girl was just\nlooking to get\xc2\x97oh I see.'
Rachel	 Oh, between you telling him that I wanted to have a fling and me putting\nout on the first date\xc2\x97oh, he\xc2\x92s so gonna get the wrong idea.'
Monica	 Hey, Joey, could you pass the cheese?'
Joey	 Yeah. Listen uh, I\xc2\x92d prefer it if you didn\xc2\x92t call me Joey. Since\nI don\xc2\x92t know anyone here, I thought it\xc2\x92d be cool to try out a cool work\nnickname.'
A Waiter	 (entering) Hey, dragon! Here\xc2\x92s your tips from Monday and Tuesday.\n(hands him two envelopes)'
Joey	 (opening an envelope) There\xc2\x92s like-there\xc2\x92s like 300 bucks in\nthis one!'
The Waiter	 Yeah, people get pretty generous around the holidays. And it never\nhurts to wear tight trousers.'
Monica	 Okay. Could the waiters gather around to hear tonight\xc2\x92s specials?\nOkay, first there is a Chilean Sea Bass prepared with a Mango relish on a bag\xc2\x97Why is\nnobody writing these down?'
The Waiter	 Because we can remember them.'
Monica	 Because your all gonna make up fake specials and make me cook them like\nyou did the other night?'
The Waiter	 Well, sure, that too.'
Monica	 Okay, forget the specials for a minute. Umm, all right here\xc2\x92s the\nthing, for the last two weeks I have umm, (quietly) tried really hard to create a positive\natmosphere\xc2\x85'
The Waiter	 Can\xc2\x92t hear you!'
Monica	 (louder) A positive atmosphere! But I-I-I have had it up to here. (She\nholds her hand over her head as an afterthought.) From now on, it is gonna be my\nway, or the highway! All right? Does anybody have a problem with that?!! (Joey looks at\nthe money he\xc2\x92s holding, and doesn\xc2\x92t speak up.) Hey new guy! I said, does anybody\nhave a problem with that?!'
Joey	 No ma\xc2\x92am.'
The Waiter	 Hey! He has a name, it\xc2\x92s Dragon. Do you wanna know your name?\nCheck your hat. (to another waiter) We did the hat right? (The other waiter nods yes.)'

Monica	 What the hell happened?!'
Joey	 I am so-so-so sorry. I was gonna do it! Really! But I was standing there\nwith 327 dollars in one hand and 238 dollars in the other hand, and I was thinking,\n"Wow! It\xc2\x92s been a long time since I had\xc2\x85 (tries to do the math in his head,\nbut can\xc2\x92t) 327 + 238 dollars!"'
Monica	 Joey, we had a deal. That-that\xc2\x92s why you\xc2\x92re here! I\xc2\x92ve\ngot to fire you!'
Joey	 And I gotta pay rent! Look, how-how about this? You don\xc2\x92t fire me,\ninstead I stay here, I gain their trust, and they\xc2\x92ll start listening to all the nice\nthings I\xc2\x92ve been saying about you.'
Monica	 What kinda things have you been saying?'
Joey	 Well nothing yet, they really hate you and I want to fit in.'
Phoebe	 (singing) Happy, happy Chanukah, Chandler and Monica. Very merry\xc2\x85'
Chandler	 (interrupting) Oh, y\xc2\x92know, y\xc2\x92know what Pheebs?'
Phoebe	 What?'
Chandler	 I\xc2\x92m not Jewish, so\xc2\x85'
Phoebe	 So! Ross doesn\xc2\x92t really decorate his tree with\nfloss, but you don\xc2\x92t hear him complaining do you? God! (Phoebe hits her guitar which\nwakes up Ross with a start.)'
Chandler	 Bad dream?'
Ross	 I wasn\xc2\x92t sleeping.'
Chandler	 Oh yeah, then uh, what was Phoebe\xc2\x92s song about?'
Ross	 The one with the cat. I gotta go, I\xc2\x92ve got another date.'
Phoebe	 So, did you pick one yet?'
Ross	 No, it turns out that the one from uptown was making a joke. But it was a\ndifferent joke than I thought\xc2\x97it wasn\xc2\x92t that funny. So I\xc2\x92m still torn.'
Phoebe	 Well look, you don\xc2\x92t really like the one from uptown and\nyou\xc2\x92re too exhausted from dating the one up in Poughkeepsie, so I say you just end\nthem both. Okay? You take a train up to Poughkeepsie and break up with her, and on your\nway back you break up with uptown. And then by the time you get home tonight, you\xc2\x92re\ndone!'
Ross	 Y\xc2\x92know, you\xc2\x92re right. Thank you.'
Phoebe	 Umm, well I had a similar problem when I lived in Prague.'
Chandler	 Prague?'
Phoebe	 There\xc2\x92s sooo much you don\xc2\x92t know.'
Rachel	 Chandler! Patrick just uh, ended things with me. Did you or did you not\ntell him that I was looking for a serious relationship?'
Chandler	 I did! I absolutely did!'
Rachel	 You idiot!!'
Chandler	 I\xc2\x92m sure you\xc2\x92re right, but why?'
Rachel	 You don\xc2\x92t tell a guy that you\xc2\x92re looking for a serious\nrelationship! You don\xc2\x92t tell the guy that! Now you scared him away!'
Chandler	 Oh, man. I\xc2\x92m sorry, I\xc2\x92m so-so sorry.'
Rachel	 Y\xc2\x92know, you should never be allowed to talk to\npeople!'
Chandler	 I know! I know!'
Rachel	 Oh! See just I\xc2\x92m right back where I started! Aww, this sucks! Being\nalone, sucks! (She sits down heavily in one of the new chairs)'
Chandler	 Well, y\xc2\x92know, you\xc2\x92re-you\xc2\x92re gonna meet somebody!\nYou\xc2\x92re a great catch! Y\xc2\x92know when I was telling all those guys about you, I\ndidn\xc2\x92t have to lie once. (He sits down on the arm of her chair)'
Rachel	 Really?'
Chandler	 Yeah! You graduated Magma Ku Laude, right?'
Rachel	 No.'
Chandler	 Oh, it doesn\xc2\x92t matter. (Kisses her on the top of her head.) Hey,\ny\xc2\x92know what, I\xc2\x92ve got two tickets to tonight\xc2\x92s Rangers game, you wanna come\nwith me?'
Rachel	 Cute guys in little shorts? Sure.'
Chandler	 Well, actually it\xc2\x92s a hockey team, so it\xc2\x92s angry Canadians\nwith no teeth.'
Rachel	 Well that sounds fun too. (They hug.)'
Chandler	 Have you ever been with a woman?'
Rachel	 What?! Chandler, what is the matter with you?!'
Chandler	 So there is no good time to ask that question.'
The Conductor	 The next station is Poughkeepsie. Poughkeepsie!'
The Woman From Poughkeepsie	 (outside Ross\xc2\x92s window) Ross? Ross!\n(she knocks on the window) Wake up! Ross! (the train starts moving) Ross! Ross!! Ross!!!\nRoss!!!!'
Monica	 I need more swordfish. (to one of the assistant chefs) Can you get me\nsome more swordfish?'
Kitchen Worker	 I don\xc2\x92t speak English.'
Monica	 You did a minute ago!'
Kitchen Worker	 Well, I don\xc2\x92t know what to tell ya!'
Monica	 Fine!'
Monica	 Okay! Very funny! Somebody let me out please?! Come on, I\xc2\x92m cold!\n(She spills something.) And covered in marinara sauce! Come on! Let me out! (the door\nopens)'
The Waiter	 You found that handle, did ya?'
Monica	 That\xc2\x92s not funny.'
The Waiter	 Well that\xc2\x92s not true.'
Monica	 (starting to cry) I\xc2\x92m a good person. And I\xc2\x92m a good chef, and\nI don\xc2\x92t deserve to have marinara sauce all over me! Y\xc2\x92know what, if you want me\nto quit this bad, then all you have to do is\xc2\x85'
Joey	 (interrupting) Hey! Chef Geller! Y\xc2\x92know that little speech you made\nthe other day? Well I got a problem with it!'
Monica	 You do?'
Joey	 You bet I do! I just ah, wasn\xc2\x92t listening then, that\xc2\x92s all.'
Monica	 Well if you want a problem? I\xc2\x92ll give you a problem!'
Joey	 What are you gonna do? You\xc2\x92re gonna fire me?'
Monica	 You bet your ass I\xc2\x92m gonna fire you! Get out of my kitchen! Get\nout!! (Joey leaves) All right! Anybody else got a problem? How \xc2\x91bout you Chuckles?\nYou think this is funny now?'
The Waiter	 No.'
Monica	 How about if I dance around all covered in sauce? Huh?\nYou think it\xc2\x92s funny now? '
The Waiter	 No, it\xc2\x92s really good.'
Monica	 Good! Now, take those salads to table 4, (to the kitchen worker from\nearlier) And you! Get the swordfish! (to another assistant chef) And you! Get a haircut!'
The Conductor	 Last stop, Montreal. This stop is Montreal.'
Ross	 (waking up) What? (notices that there is now a beautiful woman sitting\nnext to him)'
Woman On Train	 I made a bet with myself that you have beautiful eyes. Now that\nI see them, I win.'
Ross	 What?'
Woman On Train	 We\xc2\x92re at my stop. But would you like to have coffee?'
Ross	 (now fully awake) Are we really in Montreal?!'
Woman On Train	 Yes we are. So, coffee?'
Ross	 Coffee sounds great. (They get up) Wait, so, so you live in Montreal?'
Woman On Train	 Oh, no. But it\xc2\x92s just a two hour ferry ride to Nova Scotia.\n'
Joey	 Well I guess I should\xc2\x92ve thought about my wife and kids before I\ntalked back to chef Geller!'
Monica	 Thanks.'
Joey	 Yep! Looks like it\xc2\x92s gonna be a leeeeean Christmas at the Dragon\nhouse this year.'
Monica	 Enough!'
Joey	 (leaving) Lean-lean-lean!'

Phoebe	 (singing) "Went to the store, sat on Santa\'s lap.\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nAsked him to bring my friends all kind of crap.\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nSaid all you need is to write them a song.\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nThey haven\'t heard it, so don\'t try and sing along.\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nNo, don\'t sing along.'
