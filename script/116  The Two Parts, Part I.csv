Joey	 Not from where I was standin\xc2\x92.'
Monica	 Ross, that\xc2\x92s my jacket.'
Woman	 Hi, we\xc2\x92re the Rostins. Err, I\xc2\x92m J.C., and he\xc2\x92s Michael, and\nwe\xc2\x92re having a boy, and a girl.'
Monica	 Ah no, you see, someone was supposed to take them down around New\nYear\xc2\x92s... but obviously someone forgot.'
Rachel	 Well, someone was supposed to write "Rach, take down the\nlights" and put it on the re... frigerate... (finally noticing Monica\xc2\x92s note\nstuck to the refrigerator) How long has that been there?'
Ross	 Okay, I\xc2\x92m gonna play my sperm card one more time.'

Carol	 What that woman... did. I am not doin\xc2\x92 that. It\xc2\x92s just\ngonna have to stay in, that\xc2\x92s all, everything will be the same, it\xc2\x92ll just stay in.'
Carol	 (screaming at Ross) Oh, what do you know?\xc2\xa0 No one\'s going up to you and\nsaying, "Hi, is that your nostril?\xc2\xa0 Mind if we push this pot roast\nthrough it?"'
Nina	 I don\xc2\x92t know. For the past couple days, people have been avoiding\nme and giving me these really strange looks.'
Chandler	 Pretty well. Except for the stapler thing. (He holds up a bandaged hand.)\nLittle tip
Phoebe	 Yeah. It\xc2\x92s just, you know, it\xc2\x92s this whole stupid Ursula\nthing, it\xc2\x92s...'
Phoebe	 Um, yeah. Look, I mean, I\xc2\x92m not saying she\xc2\x92s like evil or\nanything. She just, you know, she\xc2\x92s always breaking my stuff. When I was\neight, and I wouldn\xc2\x92t let her have my Judy Jetson thermos, so she threw it under the\nbus. And then, oh, and then there was Randy Brown, who was like... Have you ever had a\nboyfriend who was like your best friend?'
Phoebe	 Well, but that\xc2\x92s what he was for me. And she you know, kind of stole\nhim away, and then... broke his heart... and then he wouldn\xc2\x92t even talk to me\nany more. Because he said he didn\xc2\x92t wanna be around... anything that looked\nlike either one of us.'
Phoebe	 But he\xc2\x92s falling in love with her.'
