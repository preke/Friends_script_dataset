Joey	 I'm tellin' you Ross, she wants you."
Ross	 She barely knows me. We just live in the same building.'
Chandler	 Any contact?'
Ross	 She lent me an egg once.'
Joey	 You're in!"
Ross	 Aw, right.'
Woman	 Hi, Ross.'
Ross	 Hey. (stutters something incoherent)'
Chandler	 Come on, Ross, you gotta get back in the game here, ok? The Rachel\nthing's not happening, your ex-wife is a lesbian\xc2\x97I don't think we need a third... "
Joey	 Excuse me, could we get an egg over here, still in the shell? Thanks.'
Ross	 An egg?'
Joey	 Yeah, you\'re gonna go up to her and say, "Here\'s your egg back, I\'m\nreturning your egg."'
Chandler	 I think it's winning."
Ross	 I think it's insane."
Chandler	 She'll love it. Go with the egg, my friend."
Joey	 Think it'll work?"
Chandler	 No, it's suicide. The man's got an egg."
Monica	 You can not do this.'
Rachel	 Do what, do what?'
Monica	 Roger wants to take her out tomorrow night.'
Rachel	 No! Phoebes! Don't you remember why you dumped the guy?"
Phoebe	 'Cause he was creepy, and mean, and a little frightening... alright,\nstill, it's nice to have a date on Valentine's Day!"
Monica	 But Phoebe, you can go out with a creepy guy any night of the year. I\nknow I do. '
Rachel	 Well, what are you guys doing tomorrow night?'
Joey	 Actually, tomorrow night kinda depends on how tonight goes.'
Chandler	 Oh, uh, listen, about tonight...'
Joey	 No, no, no, don't you dare bail on me. The only reason she's goin' out\nwith me is because I said I could bring a friend for her friend."
Chandler	 Yes, I know, but her friend sounds like such a...'
Joey	 Pathetic mess? I know, but\xc2\x97come on, man, she's needy, she's\nvulnerable. I'm thinkin', cha-ching! (Rachel throws a roll at Joey. He picks it up and\neats it.) Thanks. Look, you have not been out with a woman since Janice. You're doin'\nthis."
Ross	 Hi. She said yes.'
Chandler	 Yes! Way to go, man! (Chandler and Ross hug. Something crunches in\nRoss' shirt pocket.) Still got the egg, huh?"
Joey	 (Looking at himself in the reflection on a knife) How do I look?'
Chandler	 Oh, uh, I... don't... care. (Joey's date shows up) Ok, now, remember,\nno trading. You get the pretty one, I get the mess."
Lorraine	 Hi, Joey. Well well, look what you brought. Very nice.'
Chandler	 ...And what did you bring?'
Lorraine	 She's checking the coats. Joey, I'm gonna go wash the cab smell off my\nhands. Will you get me a white Zinfandel, and a glass of red for Janice."
Chandler	 Janice?'
Janice	 Oh.... my.... God.'
Chandler	 (angrily) Hey, it's Janice."
Chandler	 Ok, I'm makin' a break for it, I'm goin' out the window. "
Joey	 No, no, no, don't! I've been waitin' for like, forever to go out with\nLorraine. Just calm down. "
Chandler	 Calm down? Calm down? You set me up with the woman that I've dumped\ntwice in the last five months!"
Joey	 (at the urinal) Can you stop yellin'? You're makin' me nervous, and I\ncan't go when I'm nervous."
Chandler	 I'm sorry, I'm sorry, you're right. (gets up right behind Joey and\nyells in his ear) Come on, do it, do it, go, come on!!!"
Rachel	 Ok, ok, Roger was creepy, but he was nothing compared to Pete Carney.'
Monica	 Which one was Pete Carney?'
Rachel	 Pete the Weeper? Remember that guy who used to cry every time we had\nsex. (imitating) "Was it good for you?"'
Monica	 Yeah, well, I\'ll take a little crying any day over\nHoward-the-"I-win"-guy. (imitating) "I win! I win!" I went out with\nthe guy for two months\xc2\x97I didn\'t get to win once.'
Rachel	 How did we end up with these jerks? We're good people!"
Monica	 I don't know. Maybe we're some kinda magnets."
Phoebe	 I know I am. That's why I can't wear a digital watch."
Monica	 There's more beer, right?"
Phoebe	 Oh! You know my friend Abby who shaves her head? She said that if you\nwant to break the bad boyfriend cycle, you can do like a cleansing ritual.'
Rachel	 Pheebes, this woman is voluntarily bald.'
Phoebe	 Yeah. So, we can do it tomorrow night, you guys. It's Valentine's Day.\nIt's perfect."
Monica	 Ok, well, what kind of ritual?'
Phoebe	 Ok. We can, um, we can burn the stuff they gave us.'
Rachel	 Or?'
Phoebe	 Or...or we can chant and dance around naked, you know, with sticks.'
Monica	 Burning's good."
Rachel	 Burning's good. Yeah, I got stuff to burn."
Lorraine	 You know, ever since I was little, I've been able to pick up quarters\nwith my toes."
Joey	 Good for you. (jumps suddenly) Uh, quarters or rolls of quarters?'
Janice	 By the way, Chandler. I cut you out of all my pictures. So if you want,\nI have a bag with just your heads.'
Chandler	 That's OK."
Janice	 Oh, are you sure? Really? Because you know, you could make little\npuppets out of them, and you could use them in your theater of cruelty.'
Joey	 (to Lorraine) We can't do that."
Chandler	 (disgusted) What? What can't you do?"
Joey	 Uh, can I talk to you for a second, over there?'
Joey	 Uh, we might be leaving now.'
Chandler	 Tell me it\'s "you and me" we.'
Joey	 She said she wants to slather my body with stuff and then lick it off. I'm\nnot even sure what slathering is, but I definitely want to be a part of it."
Chandler	 Ok, you can not do this to me.'
Joey	 You're right, I'm sorry. You're right."
Lorraine	 (to waiter) Uh, can we have three chocolate mousses to go please?'
Joey	 I'm outta here. Here's my credit card. Dinner's on me. I'm sorry,\nChandler."
Chandler	 I hope she throws up on you.'
Chandler	 So...'
Janice	 Just us.'
Chandler	 Oh, what a crappy night!'
Janice	 Although, I have enjoyed the fact that, uh your shirt's been stickin'\noutta your zipper ever since you came back from the bathroom. "
Chandler	 Excuse me. (gets up, jumps up and down while he zips his zipper up...\nother patrons look at him) How ya doin'?"
Janice	 So, do we have the best friends or what?'
Chandler	 Joey's not a friend. He's...a stupid man who left us his credit card.\nAnother drink? Some dessert? A big screen TV?"
Janice	 I will go for that drink.'
Chandler	 You got it. Good woman! (the waiter turns around, it's a man) Could we\nget a bottle of your most overpriced champagne?"
Janice	 Each.'
Chandler	 That's right, each. Oh, and a uh Rob Roy. (to Janice) I've always\nwanted to know..."
Janice	 Happy Valentine's Day!"
Janice	 Oh, I miss you already. Can you believe this happened?'
Chandler	 No... no! And yet it did. Good-bye, Janice.'
Janice	 Kiss me!'
Monica	 Oh, Chandler, sorry.'
Monica	 Ohhh, Chandler, sorry! Hey, Janice.'
Janice	 Hi, Monica.'
Chandler	 Ok, well, this was very special.'
Monica	 Rach, come see who's out here!"
Rachel	 Oh my god. Janice, hi!'
Chandler	 Janice is gonna go away now.'
Monica	 I'll be right back."
Rachel	 Oh, Joey, look who it is.'
Joey	 (in disbelief) Whoa.'
Chandler	 Oh, good, Joey's home now."
Janice	 This is so fun. This is like a reunion in the hall.'
Monica	 Oh, hi, Ross. Yeah. There's someone I want you to say hi to. (to\nChandler) He just happened to call."
Janice	 Hi, Ross. Yes, it's me. How did you know? (she laughs obnoxiously) "
Ross	 I'm just sayin' if dogs do experience jet lag, then, because of the whole\num, seven dog years to one human year thing, then, when a dog flies from New York to Los\nAngeles, he doesn't just lose three hours, he loses like a week and a half."
Kristin	 That's funny. Who are they?"
Ross	 The blond woman is my ex-wife, and the woman touching her is her... close,\npersonal friend.'
Kristin	 You mean they're lovers."
Ross	 If you wanna put a label on it.'
Kristin	 Wow, uh, anything else I should know?'
Ross	 Nope, nope, that's it. "
Ross	 Oh, and she's pregnant with my baby. I always forget that part. (to Carol\nand Susan) Helloo!"
Phoebe	 Ok, so now we need, um sage branches and the sacramental wine.'
Monica	 All I have is, is oregano and a Fresca.'
Phoebe	 Um, that's ok! (throws it in fire) Ok. All right. Now we need the semen\nof a righteous man."
Rachel	 Ok, Pheebs, you know what, if we had that, we wouldn't be doing the\nritual in the first place."
Monica	 Can we just start throwing things in?'
Phoebe	 Ok, yeah, ok. (she throws the directions in) Oh, OK.'
Rachel	 (tossing things in the fire) Ok, Barry's letters. Adam Ritter's boxer\nshorts."
Phoebe	 Ok, and I have the, uh receipt for my dinner with Nokululu Oon Ah Ah.'
Monica	 Look, here's a picture of Scotty Jared naked."
Rachel	 (looking at picture) Hey he's wearing a sweater."
Monica	 No.'
Rachel and Phoebe	 Eww!'
Rachel	 And here we have the last of Paulo's grappa."
Monica	 Hey, Rachel, isn't that stuff almost pure..."
Chandler	 How can I dump this woman on Valentine's day?"
Joey	 I don't know. You dumped her on New Year's."
Chandler	 Oh, man. In my next life, I'm coming back as a toilet brush."
Janice	 Hello, funny Valentine.'
Chandler	 Hi, Just Janice.'
Janice	 Hello, Joey, our little matchmaker. I could just kiss you all over, and\nI'm gonna!"
Joey	 (to Chandler) If you don't do it, I will."
Ross	 So, um, what do you do for a living?'
Kristin	 Well, um, for the past few years I've been working..(Ross is watching\nCarol and Susan, not listening to Kristin. Susan gets up, and has to go. Carol is left\nstranded)...which is funny because, that wasn't even my major."
Carol	 Oh no. I thought you said they could shoot the spot without you. '
Susan	 I thought they could...I'll try to get back as soon as I can. I'm sorry.\n(Ross realizes Kristin was expecting him to laugh, so he starts to laugh hysterically.)"
Ross	 Now that is funny. Hey, do you think...would it be too weird if I invited\nCarol over to join us? 'Cause she's, she's alone now, and pregnant, and, and sad. "
Kristin	 (reluctantly) I guess.'
Ross	 Are you sure? Great. Carol? Wanna come over and join us?'
Carol	 Oh, no no no. I'm fine. I'm fine."
Ross	 Come on. These people'll scooch down. You guys'll scooch, won't you? Let's\ntry scooching! Come on. Come on. Uh, Kristen Riggs, this is Carol Willick. Carol, Kristin.\nUh, Carol teaches sixth grade. And, Kristin, Kristin...(struggling)...does something that,\nfunnily enough, wasn't even her major!"
Fireman No. 1	 What do we got there?'
Fireman No. 2	 A piece of something
Monica	 You know, it's a really funny story how this happened."
Fireman No. 3	 It's all right. It's all right. You don't have to explain. This\nisn't the first boyfriend bonfire that we've seen get out of control."
Fireman No. 1	 You're our third call tonight."
Rachel	 Really?'
Fireman No. 2	 Oh, sure, Valentine's is our busiest night of the year."
Janice	 I brought you something.'
Chandler	 Is it loaded? Oh, little candy hearts. (reading the candy) Chan and\nJan Forever.'
Janice	 I had them made special.'
Chandler	 Ok, Janice. Janice. Hey, Janice. Look, there's no way for me to tell\nyou this. At least there's no new way for me to tell you this. I just don't things\nare gonna work out."
Janice	 That's fine."
Chandler	 (surprised) It is?'
Janice	 Mmm-hmm. Because I know that this isn't the end."
Chandler	 Oh no, you see, actually it is.'
Janice	 No, it isn't, because you won't let that happen. Don't you know it yet?\nYou love me, Chandler Bing."
Chandler	 Oh, no I don't."
Janice	 Well then ask yourself this. Why do you think we keep ending up\ntogether? New Year's? Who invited who? Valentine's? Who asked who into whose bed? "
Chandler	 I did, but...'
Janice	 You seek me out. Something deep in your soul calls out to me like a\nfoghorn. Janice, Janice. You want me. You need me. You can't live without me. And you know\nit. You just don't know you know it. See ya."
Chandler	 Call me!'
Carol	 It's not true. I never called your mother a wolverine."
Ross	 You did so. I swear, I swear\xc2\x97(noticing Kristin's absence) How long\nhas she been in the bathroom?"
Carol	 Uh, I don't think she's in the bathroom. Her coat is gone."
Ross	 Well maybe it's cold in there. Or maybe I screwed up the first date I had\nin 9 years. "
Carol	 That could be it.'
Ross	 Oh, god. (He puts his head down on the grill) You know, this is still\npretty hot. (He picks his head up, and a mushroom sticks to his head. Carol picks it off\nand eats it.)'
Carol	 Mushroom. Smile. They won't all be like this. Some women might even stay\nthrough dinner. Sorry, that's not funny"
Ross	 No, it\'s just...you know the whole "getting on with your life"\nthing. Well, do I have to? I mean, I\'m sitting here with this cute woman, and, and, and\nshe\'s perfectly nice, and, but that there\'s, that\'s it. And um, and then I\'m here talkin\'\nto you, and, and it\'s easy, and it\'s fun, and, and I don\'t, I don\'t have to...You know,\nhere\'s a wacky thought. Um, what\'s say you and I give it another shot? No no no, I know\nwhat you\'re gonna say, you\'re a lesbian. But what do you say we just put that aside for\nnow you know? Let\'s just stick a pin in it, ok? Because, we\'re great together, you know.\nYou can\'t deny it. Besides, you\'re carrying my baby. I mean, how perfect is that? But see,\nyou know, you keep sayin\' that, but there\'s somethin\' right here. I love you.'
Carol	 Oh, I love you too. But...'
Ross	 No but, no but.'
Carol	 You know that thing you put over here with the pin in it? It's time to\ntake the pin out. You'll find someone, I know you will. The right woman is just waiting\nfor you."
Ross	 That's easy for you to say, you found one already."
Carol	 All you need is a woman who likes men and you'll be set."
Carol	 Not her.'
Fireman No. 3	 We get off around midnight, why don't we pick you up then?"
Rachel	 So, um, will you bring the truck?'
Fireman No. 3	 I'll even let you ring the bell."
Rachel	 Oh, my god.'
Phoebe	 See, there you go, the cleansing works!'
Monica	 They're nice guys."
Rachel	 Oh, they're firemen guys."
Fireman No. 1	 You guys tell them you were married?'
Fireman No. 2	 No way!'
Fireman No. 3	 Are you kidding? My girlfriend doesn't know, I'm not gonna tell\nthem!"
