Joey	 Okay Rach, that muffin and espresso, $4.50. Ross, double latte, $2.75.\nChandler, coffee and a scone, $4.25. And Pheebs, herbal tea, $1.25. So, all together\nthat\xc2\x92s (pauses to figure the total) $12.75.'
Chandler	 This coming from the man who couldn\xc2\x92t split our 80 dollar phone\nbill in half.'
Woman	 Hi!'
Joey	 Hi!'
Woman	 How much do I owe you for the muffin and the latte?'
Joey	 Oh that\xc2\x92s on the house courtesy of Joey Tribbiani.'
Woman	 Oh great! Well, tell him thanks. And since uh, Joey seems like such a\nnice guy, maybe we could go on a date sometime?'
Joey	 Well, he\xc2\x92s not used to women being so forward with him; but uh, I\ngood check with him\xc2\x97He says it\xc2\x92s okay. (She hands him her card.) Great! Thanks!\nBye-bye!'
Ross	 Hey Joey, how come our stuff isn\xc2\x92t free?'
Joey	 It will be when you look like that in a tight skirt! This is great!\nI\xc2\x92m getting more dates than ever!'
Rachel	 Wait a minute, you\xc2\x92re only giving free stuff away to the pretty\ngirls?'
Phoebe	 Yeah Joey that is so gross!'
Joey	 How about a scone on the house baby?'
Phoebe	 (giggles) I\xc2\x92m pretty.'

Ross	 Hey does anyone have any gum?'
Phoebe	 Oh I do! (She grabs her huge purse and starts rummaging through it and\ntaking out various items in a futile search for the gum.) Oh, y\xc2\x92know what? No.\n(Pause) Wait a second. (She removes a bag filled with water that has a goldfish swimming\nin it.) I know it\xc2\x92s in here somewhere.'
Ross	 Y\xc2\x92know what? I\xc2\x92m good! I\xc2\x92m good!'
Monica	 (entering) Hey!'
Ross	 Hey!'
Chandler	 Hey, what are you doing here? Shouldn\xc2\x92t you be at work?'
Monica	 (congested) Ugh, they sent me home. They said I can\xc2\x92t work if\nI\xc2\x92m sick.'
All	 Ohh!'
Chandler	 I\xc2\x92m so sorry you\xc2\x92re sick.'
Monica	 I\xc2\x92m not sick!! I don\xc2\x92t get sick! Getting sick is for weaklings\nand for pansies! '
Rachel	 Honey, no one thinks you\xc2\x92re a pansy, but we do think you need a\ntissue. (She notices something hanging from Monica\xc2\x92s nose, as does Joey.)'
Monica	 (wiping her nose) I have not been sick in over three years! (Sneezes.) '
Chandler	 I\xc2\x92m gonna grab you some tissue.'
Monica	 I don\xc2\x92t need a tissue! I\xc2\x92m fine-d! '
Ross	 When you put a \xc2\x91D\xc2\x92 at the end of \xc2\x91Fine\xc2\x92 you\xc2\x92re\nnot fine.'
Monica	 I\xc2\x92m fine-d. I\xc2\x92m fine-d! Y\xc2\x92know, it\xc2\x92s a really hard\nword to say.'
Chandler	 Yes?'
Woman	 Hi, is Rachel here? I\xc2\x92m her sister.'
Rachel	 Oh my God, Jill!'
Jill	 Oh my God, Rachel!'
Chandler	 Oh my God, introduce us!'
Rachel	 This is Chandler. (Points at him.)'
Jill	 Hi!'
Rachel	 And you know Monica and Ross!'
Ross	 Hi Jill.'
Rachel	 And that\xc2\x92s Phoebe (points), and that\xc2\x92s Joey.'
Joey	 Hey, (in the Joey voice) how you doin\xc2\x92?'
Rachel	 Don\xc2\x92t!! (Joey backs away frightened.) (To Jill) Honey, what are you\ndoing here?!'
Phoebe	 (To Ross) Which-which sister is this? Is this the spoiled one or\nthat\xc2\x92s bitter?'
Jill	 (To Rachel) Daddy cut me off.'
Phoebe	 Never mind, I got it.'
Jill	 And y\xc2\x92know what I said to him? "I\xc2\x92m gonna hire a lawyer and\nI\xc2\x92m gonna sue you and take all your money. Then I\xc2\x92m gonna cut you off!"'
Rachel	 Wow! What did he say?'
Jill	 That he wouldn\xc2\x92t pay for my lawyer! Then he told me to come here and\nlearn about the value of money from the one daughter he\xc2\x92s actually proud off.'
Rachel	 Oh! Did you hear that?! My dad\xc2\x92s proud of me! My dad\xc2\x92s proud\nof me.'
Monica	 Rach? (Points to Jill.)'
Rachel	 Oh yeah, sorry. Wait honey, so what did you do that made dad cut you\noff?'
Jill	 Okay, I bought a boat.'
Monica	 You bought a boat?'
Jill	 Yeah but it wasn\xc2\x92t for me, it was for a friend.'
Chandler	 Boy did we make friends with the wrong sister! (Rachel glares\nat him.)'
Rachel	 Jill, honey, I think this is the best thing that could\xc2\x92ve ever\nhappened to you. I mean you needed to get out on your own anyway! And you know when I did\nit, I-I-I at first I was scared, and look at me now! I\xc2\x92m the only daughter dad is\nproud of! Okay, well this is, this is what you\xc2\x92re gonna do. You\xc2\x92re gonna get a\njob, you\xc2\x92re gonna get an apartment, and then I\xc2\x92ll help you and you can stay with\nus. Right Pheebs, she can stay with us?'
Phoebe	 Of course, yeah!'
Jill	 Oh, that\xc2\x92s so great! Okay, I\xc2\x92m really gonna do this! I\ndon\xc2\x92t know how to thank you guys.'
Phoebe	 Ooh, I like cards.'
Joey	 (to a customer) Are you all finished here?'
Customer	 Yes.'
Joey	 Great! (Joey takes his cookie and finishes it.)'
Gunther	 Okay, here are the tips for this morning. Jen gets 50, 50 for me, and\nJoey owes eight dollars.'
Joey	 What?!'
Gunther	 For all the free food you gave away.'
Joey	 Well if it\xc2\x92s free food, how come you\xc2\x92re charging me for it?'
Gunther	 We don\xc2\x92t give anything away unless it\xc2\x92s someone\xc2\x92s\nbirthday.'
Joey	 Well, what if they came in third in a modeling contest?'
Gunther	 No!'
Joey	 (to a woman who came in third in a modeling contest) Sorry! (He grabs her\nmuffin away and returns it to the serving tray.)'
Jill	 (entering, carrying a bunch of shopping bags) I just had the hardest day.\nThose bags are so heavy. (Sets them down.)'
Ross	 Jill, how did you pay for all this? I thought your dad took away your\ncredit card.'
Jill	 Oh please, I memorized those numbers when I was 15. But look at all the\ncool make-it-on-my-own stuff I got! (Holds up a red sweater) This is my "Please, hire\nme" sweater. (Holds up a pair of black pants) And these are my, "Don\xc2\x92t you\nwant to rent me this apartment?" pants. '
Ross	 I don\xc2\x92t think charging new clothes too your dad qualifies as making\nit on your own.'
Jill	 Oh, Mr. Scientist has to get all technical!'
Phoebe	 Seriously, I don\xc2\x92t Rachel\xc2\x92s gonna think it\xc2\x92s a good idea.'
Jill	 So who made her queen of the world?'
Phoebe	 I would love that job!'
Rachel	 (entering) Hey! What\xc2\x92s goin\xc2\x92 on?'
Jill	 Hey!'
Rachel	 (notices Jill\xc2\x92s bags) Jill! Did you shop?!'
Jill	 No! They did! (Points to Phoebe and Ross)'
Phoebe and Ross	 Yeah, we went shopping!'
Rachel	 You went shopping?! What, and then you just came in here and paraded it\nright under Jill\xc2\x92s nose when you know she\xc2\x92s trying to quit. Wow, you guys are\nterrible!'
Phoebe	 Sorry Jill.'
Ross	 Sorry-sorry Jill.'
Rachel	 What\xc2\x92d you get?'
Phoebe	 Oh well, all right, I got (Ross hands her a bag) (To Ross) thank you, I\ngot uh, this y\xc2\x92know "I want a job sweater." (Holds up the same sweater.)'
Rachel	 Oh.'
Phoebe	 And, and then I got uh, these are apartment pants.'
Rachel	 Apartment pants?'
Phoebe	 Yeah, you never heard of them?'
Rachel	 No, of course, of course I\xc2\x92ve heard of them! Ross, what did you\nget?'
Ross	 Huh? Oh, I got this\xc2\x97(Holds up this pink frilly thing)\xc2\x97this!'
Rachel	 A pajmena?'
Ross	 Yeah! Oh, I-I love this babies!'
Rachel	 Really?'
Ross	 Ross, wants a pajmena?'
Ross	 It\xc2\x92s a rug. (Jill winces.)'
Rachel	 Jill?'
Jill	 (covers her eyes and starts crying) I\xc2\x92m sorry Rachel, I\xc2\x92m\nsorry\xc2\x85'
Rachel	 Oh, come on! You think that\xc2\x92s gonna work on me?! I invented that!'
Jill	 Right! But, I am sorry.'
Rachel	 All right, it\xc2\x92s okay. One little setback is okay, just don\xc2\x92t\nlet it happen again, all right? Now since daddy paid for all this stuff, I should\ntake it all away. But I\xc2\x92m just gonna take the-the pajmena. (Ross hands it to her.)\nAnd the uh, and the uh pants. Y\xc2\x92know what, I\xc2\x92m just gonna take it all away,\n\xc2\x91cause that way you\xc2\x92ll just really learn the lesson. Okay? All righty, I\xc2\x92m\ngonna run a couple of errands and I will see you at dinner. (Leaves with all of\nJill\xc2\x92s stuff.)'
Jill	 She took all my stuff.'
Ross	 Yeah. Everything but, the little blue one. (Holds it up for her.)'
Jill	 (gasps) That\xc2\x92s the best one! Oh my God, (hugs him) thank you so much!'
Ross	 Well. Hey\xc2\x85'
Jill	 Oh my gosh, that was so lame. Like a pajmena could be a rug!'
Ross	 Oh yeah, how about you and the, (mimics her fake cry) "I\xc2\x92m\nsorry!"'
Jill	 (hits him) Shut up! I did not sound like that at all!'
Phoebe	 What about, what about when I said y\xc2\x92know about the apartment\npants, how dumb was I?'
Jill	 Were you this cute in high school?'
Ross	 Oh stop.'
Jill	 No you stop!'
Ross	 No, you stop!'
Jill	 You stop!'
Phoebe	 (gets up and sits between them) Okay-okay, why don\xc2\x92t I sit here and\nyou\xc2\x92ll both stop it!'
Monica	 Okay, so what do you, what do you want to do? Let\xc2\x92s do something\ncrazy!'
Chandler	 I know, let\xc2\x92s rest and drink lots of fluids. (Holds up a glass of\norange juice.)'
Monica	 Okay, I\xc2\x92ll rest. But y\xc2\x92know if I\xc2\x92m going to bed, then\nyou\xc2\x92re coming with me.'
Chandler	 That would be impossible to resist if you weren\xc2\x92t all drippy\nhere. (Points to his nose.)'
Monica	 (wiping her nose) Are you saying that you don\xc2\x92t wanna get with\nthis? (Tries to do a little sexy body rub, but it doesn\xc2\x92t work all that well with the\nbig robe.)'
Chandler	 Yeah, I don\xc2\x92t you should say that even when you\xc2\x92re healthy.'
Monica	 (in a sexy voice) Come on. (Coughs loudly.)'
Chandler	 Don\xc2\x92t take this personally okay? It\xc2\x92s just that I just\ncan\xc2\x92t have sex with a sick person.'
Monica	 I\xc2\x92m with you Chandler! I mean I can\xc2\x92t have sex with a sick\nperson either, that\xc2\x92s disgusting! But I\xc2\x92m not sick! Let me prove it to you. We\nare two healthy people in the pribe of libe.'
Chandler	 That\xc2\x92s the thing, see I would like to stay in the pribe of\nmwha-ah-libe.'
Rachel	 Hey!'
Phoebe	 Hey.'
Rachel	 What\xc2\x92s up?!'
Phoebe	 Umm, I think there\xc2\x92s something you should maybe know.'
Rachel	 Well, it\xc2\x92d better not be about the apartment pants, because I just\npitched the idea to my boss at Ralph Lauren and she loved it.'
Phoebe	 No. No. It\xc2\x92s just I was umm, I was with Ross and Jill after you\nleft and umm, I\xc2\x92m pretty sure I saw a little spark between them.'
Rachel	 What?!'
Phoebe	 Yeah I mean it\xc2\x92s probably nothing, but I just wanted to warn you\nthat there might be something there.'
Rachel	 With Ross and Jill?'
Phoebe	 Yeah!'
Rachel	 With Ross and my sister?'
Phoebe	 Yeah.'
Rachel	 With my sister Jill and my ex-boyfriend Ross?'
Phoebe	 Yeah.'
Rachel	 Oh there is no way.'
Phoebe	 Okay then.'
Rachel	 Oh my God! I can not believe that! I mean I don\xc2\x92t really like it\nwhen Ross goes out with anyone, but my sister isn\xc2\x92t that like incest or something?!\nOh my God, and they\xc2\x92re gonna have sex! Oh! Oh no what if he marries her too?! Oh this\nis just terrible, this is just terrible. And I can\xc2\x92t stop it! I can\xc2\x92t\xc2\x97I\ndon\xc2\x92t own Ross! Y\xc2\x92know? And Jill, she should be able to do whatever it is that\nshe wants to do! And oh my God, I can\xc2\x92t believe Ross is marrying my little sister,\nthis terrible. Oh my God, this is just the worst thing that could have ever happened to\nme.'
Phoebe	 But great news about the apartment pants, huh?'
Joey	 That\xc2\x92ll be $3.85.'
Woman	 What do you mean? Yesterday you said I was too pretty to pay for stuff!'
Joey	 It\xc2\x92s just I can\xc2\x92t because my manager said I\xc2\x85 (Gets an idea)\n(Starts singing) "Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you. Happy birthday dear\nAnnie\xc2\x85'
Woman	 Amy!'
Joey	 (still singing) "\xc2\x85Amy! Happy birthday to you!"'
Joey	 Yeah, not it here it isn\xc2\x92t.'
Jill	 (entering) Sorry I\xc2\x92m late, what\xc2\x92s up?'
Rachel	 (on the couch) Oh hi! Y\xc2\x92know, I just wanted to see if there were\nany leads on the old job front.'
Jill	 Oh no! But I just walked past three sales and I didn\xc2\x92t go in. How\nstrong am I?'
Rachel	 That is great. Hey, y\xc2\x92know who doesn\xc2\x92t have to job hunt? Ross.\nHe works at the university. '
Jill	 Yeah.'
Rachel	 Oh so you know that, you guys talked about that, so you get along, so\nyou think you\xc2\x92re gonna go out?'
Jill	 Me go out with Ross?! No! God no! What would make you think that?'
Rachel	 I just, Phoebe, said y\xc2\x92know thought she saw something between you\nguys.'
Jill	 No! I mean he\xc2\x92s nice.'
Rachel	 Yeah.'
Jill	 He\xc2\x92s the kind of guy you\xc2\x92re friends with, y\xc2\x92know? But\nhe\xc2\x92s not the kind of guy you date. He\xc2\x92s the kind of guy you\xc2\x92d date\nbecause you did. Me, not so much.'
Rachel	 Oh not-not so much. Umm, what-what do you, what do you mean is there\nsomething wrong with Ross?'
Jill	 Oh no-no-no, he\xc2\x92s just I don\xc2\x92t know, he\xc2\x92s just a little\nbookish.'
Rachel	 Are-are you saying he\xc2\x92s a geek?'
Jill	 You think so too?'
Rachel	 No! No I, no Ross is not a geek!'
Jill	 Fine, then let\xc2\x92s just say he\xc2\x92s not my type.'
Rachel	 What handsome is not your type? Smart? Kind? Good kisser? What those\nthings aren\xc2\x92t on your list? Ross is a great guy! You would be lucky to be with him!'
Jill	 Well okay, if it means that much to you, then I\xc2\x92ll ask him out.'
Rachel	 Oh no-no-no, no-no-no, that\xc2\x92s not what I meant.'
Jill	 No! Y\xc2\x92know what Rachel? You\xc2\x92re right, y\xc2\x92know he has been\nreally nice to me.'
Rachel	 Yeah but, he\xc2\x92s not your type.'
Jill	 Yeah but maybe that\xc2\x92s a good thing. Y\xc2\x92know I\xc2\x92m doing all\nthese different sorts of things, and maybe I should try dating a geek too!'
Rachel	 Yeah but, you don\xc2\x92t, you don\xc2\x92t, you don\xc2\x92t want to try to\nmuch too fast. Y\xc2\x92know? I mean, you do remember what happened to the little girl that\ntried to much too fast don\xc2\x92t you?'
Jill	 What?'
Rachel	 She-she died Jill.'

Monica	 (still sick) Chandler!'
Chandler	 Oh what is it honey, you need some tea? Some soup? (He gets up from\nthe couch and goes into the bedroom to find Monica, still in the robe, lying seductively\non the bed. Or at least she\xc2\x92s trying too and as he enters the room, she takes the\nrobe off on of her legs.) Oh-ohhhh!'
Monica	 (trying to be seductive) Calling Dr. Big, Dr. Big to the bed.'
Chandler	 Oh Jeez honey, I thought, I thought you were asleep.'
Monica	 How could I be asleep knowing that you were in the next room.'
Chandler	 I was asleep. (She takes off her robe and starts to shiver) Oh no!\nNo-no honey! Y\xc2\x92know what\xc2\x92s sexy? Layers. Layers are sexy. And blankets are sexy.\nAnd oh! Hot water bottles are sexy.'
Monica	 Come on, get into bed! I want to prove to you that I\xc2\x92m not sick! I\nwanna make you feel, as good as I feel. (Sneezes.) '
Chandler	 Would you please get some rest!'
Monica	 I\xc2\x92m fine. (She goes into one of those half sneezing, half-coughing\nfits that you get with a bad cold or flu.)'
Joey	 (singing) "Happy birthday to you!"'
Gunther	 You\xc2\x92re paying for that.'
Joey	 What? No-no it\xc2\x92s her birthday!'
Gunther	 You\xc2\x92ve sung Happy Birthday to 20 different women today!'
Joey	 But it really\xc2\x85'
Gunther	 You are no longer authorized to distribute birthday muffins.'
Joey	 Damnit! (Storms off.)'
Ross	 (entering) Rach? Hi!'
Rachel	 Hi!'
Ross	 Did you tell your sister to ask me out?'
Rachel	 Well yeah\xc2\x85'
Ross	 Oh wow! I mean, wow! I mean, I-I-I think she\xc2\x92s cute but I-I would\nnever have thought of going out with her, never!'
Rachel	 Really?!'
Ross	 Yeah but after you said it was okay, I figured, "Why not?!"'
Rachel	 Oh so-so not really never.'
Ross	 I have to say you are a much bigger person than I am. I mean after all\nwe\xc2\x92ve been through, I just\xc2\x97y\xc2\x92know I wish I had a brother to reciprocate.\nHey, if you ever want to go out with Monica, you have my blessing.'
Joey	 (overhearing them) Oh-ho, and mine!'
Monica	 (entering) Chandler, I think I\xc2\x92m sick.'
Chandler	 Really? Struck down in the pribe of libe!'
Monica	 Okay, fine I admit it! I feel terrible! Would you please rub this on my\nchest? (She hands him some of that Vicks Vap-O-Rub to put on.)'
Chandler	 No-no-no-no-no-no-no, you are not getting me this way.'
Monica	 Come on! I really need your help!'
Chandler	 No-no-no-no-no!'
Monica	 Fine, I\xc2\x92ll rub it on myself.'
Chandler	 Okay.'
Chandler	 So you\xc2\x92re just, kinda rubbing it on yourself?'
Monica	 Yeah?'
Chandler	 It\xc2\x92s nice.'
Monica	 Are you kidding me?! Is this; is this turning you on?'
Chandler	 Yes! (Hangs his head in shame.)'
Monica	 I can\xc2\x92t believe it! What is it? Is it the rubbing or the smell?'
Chandler	 It\xc2\x92s all very, very good. (She covers up and sits down.) So you\nwanna go uh, mix it up?'
Monica	 Not now, I\xc2\x92m sick!'
Chandler	 Oh come on you big faker!'
Monica	 What happened to your rule about never sleeping with sick people?'
Chandler	 Well that was before all the vaporizing action.'
Monica	 Okay, if you really wanna have sex\xc2\x85'
Chandler	 Okay! (Runs into the bedroom.)'
Monica	 Worked like a charm.'
Jill	 (entering) Hi!'
Rachel	 Hi! Wh-what are you doing here?'
Jill	 This is where Ross and I are meeting for our date. So, what do you think?\n(She spins to show Rachel the outfit she\xc2\x92s wearing.)'
Rachel	 Well, I-I don\xc2\x92t like it.'
Jill	 Really?!'
Rachel	 It\xc2\x92s kinda slutty.'
Jill	 It\xc2\x92s yours!'
Rachel	 Yeah well, I\xc2\x92m-I\xc2\x92m a slut.'

Ross	 Okay. So well I\xc2\x92ll umm, (To Rachel) I\xc2\x92ll have her home by\nmidnight.'
Rachel	 Why aren\xc2\x92t you home yet?!'
Monica	 (calling from the bathroom) Is someone there?'
Rachel	 Oh yes, it\xc2\x92s me! Sorry!'
Chandler	 (calling from the bathroom) What are you doing here?'
Rachel	 Uh, I\xc2\x92m just, I\xc2\x92m just looking out your window. At-at the\nview. What are you guys doing?'
Chandler	 We got some Vap-O-Rub in some places.'
Rachel	 (gasps) Oh, he brought her back to his apartment.'
Monica	 (entering with Chandler) Who? (She looks out the window at Ross\xc2\x92s\napartment) Is that your sister?'
Rachel	 Ugh, she is a slut!'
Monica	 God, Ross is on a date with your sister! How weird is that?!'

Chandler	 Ho-oh, he\xc2\x92s gonna get some! (Rachel looks at him.) Of the glare\nfrom the streetlight out of his apartment. Y\xc2\x92know so umm, he\xc2\x92s closed the drapes\nthere so he can have a nice, pleasant conversation with your little sister. (Pause) Well,\nI\xc2\x92m off to bed! (Goes to bed.)'
