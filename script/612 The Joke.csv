Ross	 Hey, you\xc2\x92re not going to believe this. I made up a joke and sent it\nin to Playboy. They printed it!'
Phoebe	 I didn\xc2\x92t know Playboy prints jokes.'
Ross	 Yeah, they print jokes, interviews, hard-hitting journalism. It\xc2\x92s not\njust about the pictures.'
Monica	 That didn\xc2\x92t work on mom, it\xc2\x92s not going to work on us.'
Ross	 (showing them the page) Here, check it out. It\xc2\x92s the first\none, too.'
Chandler	 That is funny. It was also funny when I made it up.'
Ross	 What?'
Chandler	 I made that joke up.'
Ross	 Uh, oh-oh, no you didn\xc2\x92t. I did.'
Chandler	 Yes, I did. I told it to Dan at work, and he said it was the funniest\njoke he\xc2\x92d ever heard.'
Ross	 Hey, tell Dan, \xc2\x91Thanks.\xc2\x92'
Ross	 What?'
Rachel	 I\xc2\x92m sorry, I was just reading the joke below it. Man, that one is\nfunny. (Ross grabs the magazine away from her.)'
Chandler	 Monica, you remember me telling you that joke, right?'
Monica	 No.'
Chandler	 Seriously?'
Monica	 Well, you tell a lot of jokes!'
Ross	 Look, Chandler, it\xc2\x92s my joke. But, hey, if it makes you feel any\nbetter they don\xc2\x92t print the name, so it doesn\xc2\x92t really matter who gets credit,\nright?'
Chandler	 Yeah, I guess.'
Joey	 (entering) Hey guys.'
Chandler	 (jumping up from his chair) Hey, Joey, Playboy\nprinted my joke.'
Ross	 No, it\xc2\x92s my joke, it\xc2\x92s mine. You can call them, they\xc2\x92ll\ntell you.'
Chandler	 It\xc2\x92s my joke.'
Ross	 It\xc2\x92s my joke.'
Joey	 Whoa-whoa-whoa. Jokes? You guys know they have naked chicks in there,\nright?'

Chandler	 Dude, you have got to turn on Behind the Music. The band Heart\nis having a really tough time, and I think they may break up.'
Joey	 Let\xc2\x92s go watch it at your place.'
Chandler	 Nah, Monica\xc2\x92s watching some cooking show. Come on, I don\xc2\x92t\nwant to miss when they were skinny.'
Joey	 Chandler, Chandler, y\xc2\x92know what we should do? You and I should go out\nand get some new sunglasses.'
Chandler	 What? No, I want to watch this. (He turns on the television and the\nscreen is completely covered in snow). Did your cable go out?'
Joey	 No, that\xc2\x92s VH-1. I gotta tell you, the music these kids listen\nto today . . . It\xc2\x92s like a lotta noise to me. I don\xc2\x92t know\xc2\x85'
Chandler	 Joey, why is your cable out?'
Joey	 I uh, oh! Because, uh, I haven\xc2\x92t really paid the bill'
Chandler	 If you need money, will you please-please just let me loan you some\nmoney?'
Joey	 No, Chandler. Look, forget about it, okay? Look, I know things have been a\nlittle tight since Janine moved out. Oh, was she hot. '
Chandler	 Whoa ho.'
Joey	 I know! Yeah, but, look I can handle it. All right? Look, I can listen to\nthe radio, huh? And Ross gave me this great book (holds up the Playboy magazine).'
Chandler	 (picks up the phone) All right, you want to see if the joke stealer\nwill let us watch the show at his place?'
Joey	 Sure.'
Chandler	 (with phone to ear, obviously hearing no dial tone) Paid your phone\nbill?'
Joey	 Not so much.'
Phoebe	 (entering) Hey.'
Monica	 (relieved) It\xc2\x92s only you.'
Phoebe	 Wh-wh-what are you doing?'
Rachel	 We are looking at a Playboy.'
Phoebe	 Oh, I want to look too! (She runs over and sits down and checks out a\npicture). Yikes!'
Monica	 So do you think that these pictures\xc2\x97Are, are they trying to tell a\nstory?'
Rachel	 Oh, yeah, sure. I mean, like in the case of this young woman, she has\nlost her clothes, so she rides naked on the horse, she\xc2\x92s crying out, \xc2\x91Where are\nthey, where are they?\xc2\x92'
Monica	 Well, she\xc2\x92s not going to find them lying in the grass like that.'
Phoebe	 Oh, yeah. Aw, remember the days when you used to go out to the barn,\nlift up your shirt, and bend over?'
Rachel and Monica	 Yeah.'
Rachel	 You see, now, I would date this girl. She\xc2\x92s cute, she\xc2\x92s\noutdoorsy, you know, and she knows how to build a fire. I mean, that\xc2\x92s got to come in\nhandy'
Monica	 Okay, I\xc2\x92ve got a question. If you had to pick one of us to date,\nwho would it be?'
Rachel	 (thinks) I don\xc2\x92t know.'
Monica	 Me neither.'
Phoebe	 Rachel.'
Monica	 What?!'
Phoebe	 I don\xc2\x92t know. (Pause) Me neither.'
Joey	 You forget how many great songs Heart had.'
Chandler	 Yeah.'
Ross	 You know, Barracuda was the first song I learned to play on the keyboard.'
Chandler	 So, you heard it, you repeated it, so that must mean you wrote it.'
Joey	 Oh, you guys, with this joke. I gotta say, I know I cracked up, but\nI\xc2\x92m not even sure I got it.'
Ross	 What, you didn\xc2\x92t get it? The doctor is a monkey.'
Chandler	 And monkeys can\xc2\x92t write out prescriptions.'
Chandler	 (stops laughing, to Ross) You are not allowed to laugh at my joke.'
Ross	 Your joke? Well, I think \xc2\x91the Hef\xc2\x92 would disagree, which is why\nhe sent me a check for one hundred ah-dollars.'
Chandler	 So, you stole my joke, and you stole my money.'
Ross	 Well, I was going to stick it in the ATM, but now I think I\xc2\x92ll show\nthe sexy teller that I am a published writer.'
Chandler	 Well, she is going to know that you stole the joke.'
Ross	 Oh, what are you going to do, follow me down there?'
Chandler	 Yeah!'
Ross	 Well, I\xc2\x92m not going to go now anyway (he goes to sit down).'
Chandler	 Okay (he goes to sit down).'
Gunther	 (handing Joey the bill) Here you go.'
Joey	 Ah, Gunther, I can\xc2\x92t pay for this right now because I\xc2\x92m not\nworking, so I\xc2\x92ve had to cut down on some luxuries like uh, payin\xc2\x92 for stuff.'
Gunther	 Well, if you want, you can work here.'
Joey	 Uh, I don\xc2\x92t know. Ya see, it\xc2\x92s just, see I was a regular on a\nsoap opera y\xc2\x92know? And to go from that to this, I just\xc2\x85 Plus, I\xc2\x92d have to\nwait on all my friends.'
Gunther	 Okay, but the money\xc2\x92s good, plus you get to stare at Rachel as\nmuch as you want.'
Joey	 What?!'
Gunther	 Flexible hours.'
Joey	 Maybe I could be a waiter. Could I use the phone?'
Monica	 (visibly upset) She picked Rachel. I mean, she tried to back out of it,\nbut it was obvious. She picked Rachel.'
Chandler	 (visibly upset) He took my joke, he took it. '
Monica	 It\xc2\x92s wrong. You know what else is wrong? Phoebe picking Rachel.'
Chandler	 You know who else picked Rachel? Ross, and you know what else Ross\ndid? He stole my joke. You know what? I\xc2\x92m going to get a joke journal. Y\xc2\x92know?\nAnd document the date and time of every single one of my jokes.'
Monica	 That\xc2\x92s a good idea. '
Chandler	 Yeah!'
Monica	 Do you know what\xc2\x92s a bad idea?'
Chandler	 Picking Rachel.'
Monica	 That\xc2\x92s right. (A noise comes from the living room.) Did you hear\nsomething?'
Chandler	 Maybe it\xc2\x92s the sound of Ross climbing into my brain and stealing\nmy thoughts.'
Monica	 It\xc2\x92s coming from the living room.'
Joey	 (sheepishly) I finished my book. (Chandler and Monica slowly retreat back\nto bed.)'
Monica	 (entering) Hey, you guys.'
Phoebe and Rachel	 Hey.'
Monica	 (laughing) Oh, don\xc2\x92t you guys look cute. You guys make\nsuch a cute couple.'
Rachel	 Monica, what are you doing?'
Monica	 (laughing harder) Nothing, I\xc2\x92m just trying to recreate\nsome of the fun that we had at my place the other day. (To Phoebe) Remember, when you\npicked Rachel over me? That was funny.'
Phoebe	 I guess it was kinda funny.'
Monica	 (angrily) It wasn\xc2\x92t funny at all! Why would you do that?\nWhy didn\xc2\x92t you pick me?'
Phoebe	 Fine. The reason that I was leaning a little bit more toward Rachel than\nyou is just that you\xc2\x92re \xc2\x85 just \xc2\x85 kinda high maintenance\xc2\x97Okay\nlet\xc2\x92s go to lunch!'
Monica	 That is completely untrue. You think I\xc2\x92m high maintenance? Okay,\nprove it. I want you to make a list and we\xc2\x92re going to go through it point by point!'
Phoebe	 No, okay, you\xc2\x92re right. You\xc2\x92re easy-going. You\xc2\x92re just\nnot as easy-going as Rachel. She\xc2\x92s just more flexible and-and mellow. That\xc2\x92s\nall.'
Rachel	 (To Monica) Well, people are different.'
Phoebe	 Ya, you know, Rachel \xc2\x85 she\xc2\x92ll do whatever you want.\nY\xc2\x92know, you can just walk all over her.'
Rachel	 What? Wait a minute. What are you saying, that I\xc2\x92m a pushover?\nI\xc2\x92m not a pushover.'
Phoebe	 Oh, okay, (laughing) you\xc2\x92re not a pushover.'
Rachel	 Oh my \xc2\x85 you think I\xc2\x92m a pushover. Well wait, watch this, you\nknow what? You\xc2\x92re not invited to lunch. What do you think of that? I think\nthat\xc2\x92s pretty strong, that\xc2\x92s what I think. Come on, Monica, let\xc2\x92s go to\nlunch. (She leaves)'
Monica	 (to Phoebe) You start working on that list. (She grabs her\ncoat and leaves, too.)'
Rachel	 I cannot believe her.'
Monica	 I know. Where do you wanna go eat?'
Rachel	 Oh, oh, I love that Japanese place.'
Monica	 I\xc2\x92m sick of Japanese. We\xc2\x92re not going there.'
Rachel	 All right, wherever you wanna go is cool.'
Monica	 All right.'
Ross	 (showing the Playboy magazine to Gunther) Oh, hey, Gunther, check this\nout.'
Gunther	 Yeah, that-that Chandler cracks me up. '
Joey	 Hey Ross, listen, you want anything to drink, \xc2\x91cause I\xc2\x92m heading\nup there.'
Ross	 Uh, yeah, I\xc2\x92ll take a coffee. Thanks, man.'
Joey	 Sure. (To Monica and Rachel) Coffee? \xc2\x91Cause I\xc2\x92m going up there. '
Rachel	 No.'
Monica	 No, thank you.'
Joey	 (to a table of strangers) You guys need anything, \xc2\x91cause I\xc2\x92m\nheading up there. '
Woman	 I\xc2\x92d love an ice water.'
Joey	 You got it.'
Monica	 Joey, what are you doing?'
Joey	 Just being friendly. (He gives Monica a \xc2\x91what\xc2\x92s wrong with\nyou?\xc2\x92 look and proceeds to walk behind the counter.)'
Rachel	 Joey, honey, I don\xc2\x92t think you\xc2\x92re supposed to go back there.'
Joey	 Nah, it\xc2\x92s okay. Right, Gunther? (Winks at him as if they\xc2\x92re in\non a secret together.)'
Gunther	 Don\xc2\x92t wink at me. And put on your apron.'
Joey	 Okay, but I don\xc2\x92t see you asking any other paying customers to put on\naprons. '
Monica	 Joey, do you work here?'
Joey	 No.'
Customer	 Hey, waiter.'
Joey	 Yeah?'

Monica	 Joey, what\xc2\x92s going on. What didn\xc2\x92t you tell us you work here?'
Joey	 It\xc2\x92s kind of embarrassing, y\xc2\x92know. I mean, I was an actor and\nnow I\xc2\x92m a waiter. It\xc2\x92s supposed to go in the other direction.'
Chandler	 So is your apron. You\xc2\x92re wearing it like a cape.'
Joey	 I mean, the job\xc2\x92s easy and the money\xc2\x92s good, you know? I guess\nI\xc2\x92m going to be hanging out here anyway. I might as well get paid for it, right? I\njust feel kind of weird serving you guys.'
Rachel	 Come on, Joey, I did it and it was fine.'
Ross	 Yeah, why would it be weird? Hey, Joey, can I get some coffee?'
Joey	 Okay, I guess it doesn\xc2\x92t seem that weird.'
Ross	 Seriously, I-I asked you before and you still haven\xc2\x92t gotten it.'
Joey	 See, now it\xc2\x92s weird again.'
Chandler	 I think it\xc2\x92s great that you work here. You\xc2\x92re going to make\na lot of money, and here\xc2\x92s your first tip
Rachel	 Well, you know what? This is great. Finally, I have someone I can pass\non my wisdom too. Let me tell you about a couple of things I learned while working at the\ncoffeehouse. First of all, the customer is always right. (Joey nods.) A smile goes a long\nway. (Joey smiles) And if anyone is ever rude to you? Sneeze muffin.'
Joey	 Thanks, Rach. Look, you guys are just terrific. Y\xc2\x92know? Now, how\nabout clearing out of here so I can get some new customers. It\xc2\x92s all about turnover.'
Ross	 Joey, seriously, can I get my coffee?'
Joey	 Oh, I\xc2\x92m sorry, Ross. I\xc2\x92ll get it for you right now. And since I\nmade you wait, I\xc2\x92ll toss in a free muffin.'
Rachel	 Phoebe. We would like to talk to you for a second.'
Phoebe	 Okay.'
Monica	 So, maybe I am a little high maintenance. And maybe Rachel is a little\nbit of a pushover. But you know what we decided you are?'
Rachel	 Yes, we are very sorry to tell you this, but you, Phoebe, are flaky.'
Monica	 Hah!'
Phoebe	 That true, I am flaky.'
Rachel	 So, what, you\xc2\x92re just, you\xc2\x92re just okay with being flaky?'
Phoebe	 Yeah, totally.'
Monica	 Well, then, I\xc2\x92m okay with being high maintenance.'
Rachel	 Yeah, and I am okay with being a pushover.'
Phoebe	 That\xc2\x92s great. Good for you guys.'
Monica	 I am not high maintenance!'
Rachel	 I am not a pushover!'
Phoebe	 Who said you were?'
Monica and Rachel	 You did!'
Phoebe	 Oh, I\xc2\x92m flaky. I\xc2\x92ll say anything.'
Joey	 Hey, Gunther. Can you uh, can you cover for me? I just got an audition.'
Gunther	 No, I\xc2\x92m leaving to get my hair dyed.'
Joey	 Really?! I like your natural color. Come on man, it\xc2\x92s a great part.\nLook, check it out. I\xc2\x92m the lead guy\xc2\x92s best friend and I wait for him in this\nbar and save his seat. Listen-listen. \xc2\x91I\xc2\x92m sorry, that seat\xc2\x92s saved.\xc2\x92'
Gunther	 That\xc2\x92s the whole part?'
Gunther	 Okay, I\xc2\x92ll see you in an hour.'
Joey	 Oh, man, I could totally get that part. \xc2\x91I\xc2\x92m sorry, that seat is\ntaken.\xc2\x92'
Patron	 Oh, excuse me.'
Joey	 No, no, I didn\xc2\x92t mean you. But, you believed me, huh?'
Patron	 I believed you were saving this seat for someone.'
Joey	 So, you\xc2\x92d hire me, right?'
Patron	 For what?'
Joey	 Exactly! All right, everybody, listen up. The coffeehouse is going to be\nclosed for about an hour. '
Customers	 Huh? What?'
Joey	 Yeah, it\xc2\x92s for the kids. To keep the kids off drugs. It\xc2\x92s a very\nimportant issue in this month\xc2\x92s Playboy. I\xc2\x92m sure you all read about it.'
Ross	 It\xc2\x92s my joke.'
Chandler	 It\xc2\x92s my joke.'
Ross and Chandler	 It\xc2\x92s my joke.'
Ross	 Y\xc2\x92know, I don\xc2\x92t think we\xc2\x92re going to settle this.'
Chandler	 Let\xc2\x92s have Monica decide.'
Ross	 Yeah!'
Chandler	 Yeah!'
Ross	 Hey Mon.'
Chandler	 Mon, get out here!'
Ross	 Monica! (She appears, not sure why she was summoned.)'
Chandler	 Okay, okay. You have to help us decide whose joke this is.'
Monica	 Why do I have to decide?'
Chandler	 Because you\xc2\x92re the only one that can be fair.'
Ross	 Yeah.'
Monica	 I can\xc2\x92t be fair. You\xc2\x92re my boyfriend.'
Ross	 Yeah, but I\xc2\x92m your brother. We\xc2\x92re family. That\xc2\x92s the most\nimportant thing in the world.'
Chandler	 (to Ross) Don\xc2\x92t try to sway her. (To Monica) (Softly) I\xc2\x92m\nyour only chance to have a baby. Okay, let\xc2\x92s go.'
Ross	 We\xc2\x92ll each tell you how we came up with the joke and then you decide\nwhich one of us is telling the truth\xc2\x97me. '
Monica	 Okay, Chandler, you go first.'
Chandler	 Okay, I thought of the joke two months ago at lunch with Steve.'
Monica	 Oh, wait, is he the guy I met at Christmas?'
Chandler	 Can I finish my story?!'
Monica	 Do you want me to pick you?!'
Ross	 See, I would never snap at you like that.'
Monica	 Continue.'
Chandler	 So Steve said he had to go to the doctor. And Steve\xc2\x92s\ndoctor\xc2\x92s name is Doctor Muppy. So I said, \xc2\x91Doctor Monkey?\xc2\x92 And that is how\nthe whole Doctor Monkey thing came up. (He slams his feet up on the table to emphasize his\npoint.)'
Ross	 Are you kidding? Okay, look. I-I studied evolution. Remember, evolution?\nMonkey into man? Plus, I\xc2\x92m a doctor, and I had a monkey. I\xc2\x92m Doctor Monkey!'
Chandler	 I\xc2\x92m not arguing with that.'
Monica	 All right, I\xc2\x92ve heard enough. I\xc2\x92ve made my decision.'
Monica	 You are both idiots. The joke is not funny, and it\xc2\x92s offensive to\nwomen, and doctors, and monkeys! You shouldn\xc2\x92t be arguing over who gets credit, you\nshould be arguing over who gets blamed for inflicting this horrible joke upon the world!\nNow let it go! The joke sucks! '
Ross	 It\xc2\x92s your joke.'
Chandler	 Is not.'
Monica	 Hi, Chandler. There you are.'
Chandler	 Hi, oh hi.'
Monica	 Hey, it\xc2\x92s Phoebe and Rachel. Um, why don\xc2\x92t you tell them what\nyou were telling me earlier about me not being high maintenance?'
Chandler	 (starts to recite a rehearsed speech) Monica is a self-sufficient,\ntogether lady. (Pause.) Being with her has been like being on a vacation. And what may be\nperceived as high maintenance is merely attention to detail and\xc2\x97(He falters and\nMonica prompts him.)\xc2\x97generosity of spirit.'
Rachel	 Wow, you know what? That is the best fake speech I think I\xc2\x92ve ever\nheard.'
Phoebe	 Really? I\xc2\x92ve heard better.'
Monica	 Wait, wait, he came up with that himself. Tell them, Chandler.'
Chandler	 (To Chandler) I\xc2\x92m out of words. Should I just say the whole thing\nagain?'
Monica	 Look, I am not high maintenance. I am not. Chandler!'
Chandler	 (pauses as he struggles with what he has to say) You\xc2\x92re a little\nhigh maintenance.'
Monica	 Ahhh! You are on my list.'
Chandler	 I\xc2\x92m sorry. You\xc2\x92re not easy-going, but you\xc2\x92re\npassionate, and that\xc2\x92s good. And when you get upset about the little things, I think\nthat I\xc2\x92m pretty good about making you feel better about that. And that\xc2\x92s good\ntoo. So, they can say that you\xc2\x92re high maintenance, but it\xc2\x92s okay, because I\nlike \xc2\x85 maintaining you.'
Monica	 (embarrassed) (To Phoebe and Rachel) I didn\xc2\x92t even tell him to say\nthat. (They hug). All right you\xc2\x92re off my list. '
Chandler	 (happily) I\xc2\x92m off the list. (Sits on the couch.) '
Monica	 (sits next to him) Phoebe, it\xc2\x92s okay that you don\xc2\x92t want me to\nbe your girlfriend because I have the best boyfriend.'
Phoebe	 (to Monica) Y\xc2\x92know, suddenly I find you very attractive.'
Chandler	 Hey, buddy boy, how\xc2\x92d the audition go?'
Joey	 Not good, no. I didn\xc2\x92t get the part, and I lost my job here, so\n\xc2\x85'
Phoebe	 Wow! That is a bad audition.'
Rachel	 How-how did you lose your job here?'
Joey	 Well, I had the audition but Gunther said I had to stay here and be in\ncharge so he could go get his hair dyed. So, I went anyway, and then he fired me.'
Rachel	 He left work in the middle of the day to do a personal errand and left\nyou in charge when you\xc2\x92ve been working here two days? That\xc2\x92s not, that\xc2\x92s\nnot right.'
Joey	 Yeah, what are ya gonna do?'
Rachel	 Joey, you can\xc2\x92t let him get away with that. Ya know what, I\xc2\x92m\nnot going to let him get away with that. I\xc2\x92m going to say something to him\xc2\x97No, I\nreally shouldn\xc2\x92t say anything\xc2\x97No, I should say something to him. (Goes to the\ncounter) Gunther, I want you to give Joey his job back. That is really not fair that you\nhave to fire him\xc2\x85'
Gunther	 Okay.'
Rachel	 What?'
Gunther	 He can have his job back.'
Rachel	 That\xc2\x92s right, he can have his job back. I\xc2\x92m glad we got that\nall straightened out. There you go, Joey, you got your job back.'
Joey	 That\xc2\x92s great. Thanks Rach.'
Rachel	 Yeah, pretty nice, huh? Now who\xc2\x92s a pushover?'
Phoebe	 (returning from the bathroom) Rach, you\xc2\x92re in my seat.'
Rachel	 Oh, I\xc2\x92m sorry. (Gets up and moves.)'

Phoebe	 Hey, I never got to hear who you guys would pick to be your girlfriend.'
Monica	 I pick you, Phoebe.'
Rachel	 Oh, yeah. Definitely you, Pheebs.'
Phoebe	 Yeah, well, I kinda thought.'
Chandler	 Hey.'
Rachel	 Hey. Oh, I have a question. If-if-if one of you had to pick one of the\nother two guys to go out with, who would you pick?'
Ross	 No way. '
Joey	 I\xc2\x92m not answering that.'
Chandler	 Joey! (Pause as they all stare at him.) No way. I\xc2\x92m not answering\nthat. '
