Phoebe	 Embryossss? As in, "More than one?"'
Dr. Zane	 Um-hmm, five actually.'
Phoebe	 Five? Okay, where am I giving birth, a hospital or a big box under the\nstairs?'
Dr. Zane	 We do five because that gives you a 25% chance that at least one will\nattach.'
Phoebe	 That\xc2\x92s it! 25 percent? That means that\xc2\x92s it\xc2\x92s like 75\npercent chance of no baby at all!'
Frank	 Hey, y\xc2\x92know I was thinking, what are the odds like if-if, if you\nstuff like 200 of them in there?'

Frank	 Well, you see, the-the thing is, we-we only got, we kinda have one shot\nto make it right.'
Alice	 Umm, it costs $16,000 each time you do this. So, umm, we\xc2\x92re kinda\nusing all the money we have to do it just this one time.'
Phoebe	 Whoa!! That\xc2\x97okay, that\xc2\x92s a lot of pressure on me and my\nuterus. (to Dr. Zane) So, well okay, so is there\xc2\x97is maybe is there something that I\ncan do y\xc2\x92know just to like help make sure I get pregnant?'
