Chandler	 Wait a minute, wait. You\xc2\x92re telling me this actress person is the\nonly woman you ever wanted who didn\xc2\x92t want you back?!'
Joey	 Yeah! Oh my God! (to Chandler) Is this what it\xc2\x92s like to be you?'
Monica	 Wow, you\xc2\x92re really crazy about her, huh?'
Joey	 Oh, you have no idea. And-and when we\xc2\x92re on stage I get to-to kiss\nher and-and touch her, but then she goes home with the director, and it\xc2\x92s like\nsomebody\xc2\x92s ripping out my heart!'
Phoebe	 Oh, it\xc2\x92s so great to see you feeling like this!'
Ross	 (entering) Hey!'
All	 Hey!'
Ross	 Monica, uh Dad called this morning and ah, Aunt Silvia passed away.'
Monica	 Yes!! Yes! Yeah, yeah, yeah!'
Ross	 We were all pretty shaken up about it.'
Phoebe	 Wait, am I missing something though? \xc2\x91Cause I thought death was\nsomething that\xc2\x92s supposed to be sad, in a way.'
Ross	 Well ah, Aunt Silvia was, well not a nice person.'
Monica	 Oh, she was a cruel, cranky, old bitch! (Ross gives her a look) (to\nRoss) And I\xc2\x92m sorry she died. Did Dad say I get the dollhouse?'
Ross	 You get the dollhouse.'
Monica	 I get the dollhouse!'
Phoebe	 Wow, a house for dolls, that is so cool! When I was kid, I had a barrel.'
Joey	 Uh, Pheebs, you had a barrel for a dollhouse?'
Phoebe	 No, just a barrel.'
Monica	 Y'know what, you can play with my dollhouse."
Phoebe	 Really?! Really?!'
Monica	 Any time you want. Y'know, when I was younger, all I wanted to do was to\nplay with this dollhouse, but no!! It was to be looked at, but never played with."
Chandler	 My Grandmother used to say that exact same thing to me.'

Rachel	 Hey, Sophie!'
Sophie	 Hey, Rach!'
Chandler	 Hey.'
Sophie	 Hey.'
Rachel	 Thanks for lunch, Chandler. Y'know, you didn\xc2\x92t have to walk me all\nthe way back up here."
Chandler	 Oh, that\xc2\x92s-that\xc2\x92s okay, no problem. (He starts to look\naround her office.)'
Rachel	 Honey um, honey, you do realise that we don\xc2\x92t keep the women\xc2\x92s\nlingerie here in the office?'
Chandler	 Yes, I realise that.'
Rachel	 Summer catalogue! (hands him the catalogue)'
Chandler	 That\xc2\x92s the stuff! (quickly grabs it)'
Joanna	 Rachel, I need the Versachi invoice. (to Chandler) Hello! You\ndon\xc2\x92t work for me.'
Rachel	 (introduces them) Joanna, this is my friend Chandler Bing (to Chandler)\nJoanna.'
Joanna	 Bing! That\xc2\x92s a great name.'
Chandler	 Thanks, it\xc2\x92s ah, Gaelic, for \xc2\x91Thy turkey\xc2\x92s done.\xc2\x92\nSo ah, I\xc2\x92m gonna go, nice, nice meeting you.'
Joanna	 Me too.'
Rachel	 Bye, Chandler.'
Joanna	 (to Rachel) So ah, what\xc2\x92s wrong with him?'
Rachel	 Oh, nothing, he\xc2\x92s just goofy like that, I actually, hardly notice\nit anymore.'
Joanna	 Oh no, no-no-no, is he ah, married, or involved with anyone?'
Rachel	 No!! No! He\xc2\x92s not married, or involved, with anyone!'
Joanna	 Oh, Rachel, (pause) actually, y'know what, forget it."
Rachel	 Well, I\xc2\x92ll ask him for you, if you want me too?'
Joanna	 Would you? Or, is it just to sad and desperate, and y'know something\nthat Sophie would do?"
Sophie	 Uh, uh, uh, I am here.'
Joanna	 I know that.'
Monica	 Look at it! Ohhh! Wallpaper\xc2\x92s a little faded, that\xc2\x92s okay.\nCarpet\xc2\x92s a little loose. Hardwood floors!!'
Phoebe	 (entering) Hey!'
Chandler	 Hello.'
Phoebe	 Oh! Ooh! Oh Monica! It\xc2\x92s so beautiful.'
Monica	 I know!!!'
Phoebe	 So, I\xc2\x92m here, ready to play.'
Monica	 Okay.'
Phoebe	 I brought a bunch of stuff for the house, so check it out. Ha-ha. (She\nremoves this large ceramic dog that comes up to the second floor and places it next to the\nhouse.)'
Monica	 What\xc2\x92s this?'
Phoebe	 That\xc2\x92s a dog, every house should have a dog.'
Monica	 Not one that can pee on the roof.'
Phoebe	 Well, maybe it\xc2\x92s so big because the house was built on radioactive\nwaste.'
Chandler	 (holding a tissue) And is this in case the house sneezes?'
Phoebe	 No, no, that\xc2\x92s the ghost for the attic.'
Monica	 I don\xc2\x92t want a ghost.'
Phoebe	 Well, nobody wants a ghost. But you\xc2\x92ve got one, because the house\nis sitting on an ancient Indian burial ground.'
Ross	 Wait a minute, the house was built on radioactive waste, and an ancient\nIndian burial ground? That would never happen.'
Phoebe	 Okay, obviously you don\xc2\x92t know much about the U.S. government.'
Rachel	 (entering) Hey!'
All	 Hello.'
Rachel	 I need to talk to you!'
Ross	 Sure, what\xc2\x92s up?'
Rachel	 Oh, sorry. I meant Chandler.'
Ross	 I-I know. Well if something comes up... (walks away)'
Chandler	 Oh, I'm glad you guys are past that little awkward phase."
Rachel	 Okay, my boss, Joanna, when you left, she started asking questions about\nyou...'
Chandler	 Oh-ho, liked what she saw, huh? Dug my action, did she? Checkin\xc2\x92\nout the Chan-Chan man!'
Rachel	 (looks at him) That was (pause) surreal. Okay, what do think? Are you\ninterested at all?'
Chandler	 Yeah, she seemed cool, attractive. I\xc2\x92ll do it.'
Rachel	 Oh thank you, Chandler, this is so great, she\xc2\x92s gonna love me.'
Phoebe	 (holding a dinosaur) Okay, dinosaur attack!! Quick, everybody into the\nhouse!! Ahh-ahh! (the dinosaur starts attacking the house. She starts to bark like a dog.)\nRoof! Rrroof-roof-roof!'
Monica	 Okay, Phoebe, y'know what? That-that\xc2\x92s it, that\xc2\x92s it, all\nright? No dinosaurs, no ghosts, no giant dogs, okay? They\xc2\x92re not the right size,\nthey\xc2\x92re not Victorian, and they just don\xc2\x92t go."
Phoebe	 Okay, (starts to pack up her stuff) fine. Come dinosaur, we\xc2\x92re not\nwelcome in the house of no imagination.'
Ross	 Uh, Pheebs, while we\xc2\x92re hovering around the subject. I just have to\nsay dinosaurs, they-they don\xc2\x92t go, rrroof!'
Phoebe	 The little ones do.'
Joey	 Hey, Kate!'
Kate	 Morning.'
Joey	 Listen, I ah, went to that restaurant that you were talking about last\nweek...'
The Director	 Hey, lovely! Come, talk to me a minute! (she goes over to him)'
Joey	 (to himself) And I ate the food, I had the fish, it was good, yeah. It was\ngood, yeah...'
Woman	 Hi, oh, I\xc2\x92m Lauren, Kate\xc2\x92s understudy.'
Joey	 Oh, hey! Joey Tribbiani.'
Lauren	 I know! I-I\xc2\x92m a big fan of yours.'
Joey	 (looks at her, shocked) What?!'
Lauren	 I used to umm, schedule my classes so I could watch Dr. Drake Remoray on\nDays of Our Lives.'
Joey	 Get out of here, really?!'
Lauren	 Absolutely!'
Joey	 Yeah? '
Lauren	 Oh but then, they went and dropped you down that elevator shaft.'
Joey	 They gave me the shaft all right.'
Lauren	 (laughing) Oh, you\xc2\x92re so funny. Listen, umm, what are you doing\nafter rehearsals? Do you want to get a drink, or something?'
Joey	 Well Ahh, (he sees Kate and the director kissing) yeah! Yeah, sure, a\ndrink sounds great.'
Lauren	 Cool! I-I\xc2\x92ll see you then.'
Joey	 All right.'
The Director	 All right, it\xc2\x92s time to act, my talking props. (Both Joey and\nKate just look at each other.)'
Phoebe	 Hey! '
All	 Hey!'
Phoebe	 Look everybody, look at my new dollhouse!!'
Rachel	 Wow!!'
Phoebe	 Look, look! (She lifts up the roof, and the front panel falls revealing\nthe interior.)'
Ross	 Hey, what\xc2\x92s this?!'
Phoebe	 Oh, okay, it\xc2\x92s the slide instead of stairs. Watch this. (She slides\na doll down the slide)'
Monica	 It\xc2\x92s very interesting, Phoebe.'
Rachel	 What\xc2\x92s this?'
Phoebe	 The Licorice Room, you can eat all the furniture. And, when guests come\nover, they can stay on the tootsie roll-away bed.'
Ross	 This is the coolest house ever!!'
Phoebe	 Hey, does anybody want to join me in the aroma room? (lights some\nincense)'
Rachel	 All right!'
Ross	 I would!'
Monica	 Hey, guys, guys, did you see my new, china cabinet?!'
Ross and Rachel	 Uh-huh.'
Phoebe	 Watch, watch. (She turns a strand of Christmas lights strung around the\nhouse.)'
Ross and Rachel	 Ooohhhh!!'
Phoebe	 And, and! (She turns on a bubble maker.)'
Ross and Rachel	 Ahhhh!!'
Chandler	 (entering) Hey, my Father\xc2\x92s house does that!'
Rachel	 (to Chandler) O-o-o-okay, how did it go? Tell me everything.'
Chandler	 Well, the movie was great, dinner was great, and there\xc2\x92s nothing\nlike a cool, crisp New York evening. '
Rachel	 Hmm.'
Chandler	 Of course, I didn\xc2\x92t get to enjoy any of that, because\nJoanna\xc2\x92s such a big, dull dud!'
Joanna	 Chandler is fantastic!!'
Rachel	 What?!'
Joanna	 Oh God, we just clicked! Y\xc2\x92know how people just click? Like he came\nby to pick me up, and I opened the door, and it was just like, click! Did he tell you?'
Rachel	 Oh, I....'
Joanna	 Oh, and he\xc2\x92s got such a good heart! Doesn\xc2\x92t he have a good\nheart?'
Rachel	 Oh, I know...'
Joanna	 Oh, I know and he\xc2\x92s soo sweet! Listen, he said he was going to\ncall, so put him straight through.'
Sophie	 Isn\xc2\x92t this great?!'
Joanna	 Don\xc2\x92t spoil it.'
Joey	 Come on baby, don\xc2\x92t go. Please? What do you say?'
The Director	 (answering the phone) Hello. Oh! It\xc2\x92s you. Just ah, just\none-one sec. (to Joey and Kate) I am going to take this call. When I continue, I hope that\nthere will appear on stage this magical thing that in the theatre we call, committing\nto the moment! (He goes to take the call.)'
Joey	 (to Kate) That guy\xc2\x92s like a cartoon. What do you see in him anyway?'
Kate	 He happens to be brilliant. Which is more than I can say for that sweater\nyou\xc2\x92re dating.'
Joey	 Hey, I\xc2\x92m not interested in her sweater! It\xc2\x92s what\xc2\x92s\nunderneath her sweater that counts. And besides, since ah, since when do you care who\nI\xc2\x92m going out with?'
Kate	 I don\xc2\x92t care. Why, do you want me to care?'
Joey	 Do you want me to want you to care?'
Kate	 Do you?'
Joey	 What?'
The Director	 (returning) Okay, I\xc2\x92m afraid to say this, but let\xc2\x92s pick\nit up where we left off.'
Joey	 Come on baby, don\xc2\x92t go. Please? What do you say?'
Kate	 I\xc2\x92ve got no reason to stay. '
The Director	 Stop!! Stop it! You must stop! You are bad actors! This is a\nterrible play! I\xc2\x92ll see you in the morning. (exits)'
Kate	 I can\xc2\x92t believe we go on in, in a week.'
Joey	 Hey, it\xc2\x92s gonna be all right.'
Lauren	 (to Joey) Hey! So since we\xc2\x92re getting off early, do you want to go\nand paint mugs?'
Joey	 What?'
Lauren	 You know! At the place I told you about last night?'
Joey	 Oh, yeah, with the mug painting. Yeah. I was so listening to that. But ah,\ny'know what, I think I kinda need to work on my stuff tonight."
Lauren	 Oh, okay.'
Joey	 Okay. (he gives her a peck on the cheek)'
Lauren	 I\xc2\x92ll see you tomorrow. (she kisses him full on the mouth.)'
Joey	 Okay.'
Lauren	 G\xc2\x92night. (exits)'
Joey	 (to Kate) Ah, are you okay?'
Kate	 Yeah, I guess. Look, what are we gonna do about this scene, huh?'
Joey	 I don\xc2\x92t know.'
Kate	 Well umm, maybe if it had more heat.'
Joey	 How do you mean?'
Kate	 Well, Adrian\xc2\x92s looking for a reason to stay, right? Victor can\xc2\x92t\njust kiss her, he\xc2\x92s gotta, gotta really give her a reason, y'know?"
Joey	 Maybe he could slip her the tongue.'
Kate	 Or maybe, maybe he could grab her, and, and, and, and lift her up.'
Joey	 Yeah, yeah, and then Adrian, she maybe she could wrap her legs around his\nwaist.'
Kate	 And then she could rip off his shirt and kiss his chest, and, and his\nstomach!'
Joey	 And then, then he could use his teeth, his teeth to undo her dress, and,\nand, and bite her!'
Kate	 And then right, right when the scene ends, he could take her with this\nraw, animal....'
Joey	 Something like that?'
Kate	 Yeah, that\xc2\x92s pretty much what I had in mind.'
Joey	 Yeah.'

Joey	 (to Ross) Hey.'
Ross	 Hi.'
Joey	 (to Monica) Hey. '
Ross	 Hi.'
Joey	 Hey.'
Ross	 It\xc2\x92s a little early to be drinkin\xc2\x92.'
Joey	 No-no, things ah, finally happened with Kate.'
Ross	 Ohhhhh!'
Monica	 You\xc2\x92re kidding?! That\xc2\x92s great!'
Joey	 Oh, it was so amazing. After the (pause) love making...'
Monica	 Oh my.'
Joey	 Yep. I just, I just watched her sleep for like hours, just breathing in\nand breathing out. And then I knew she was dreaming \xc2\x91cause, \xc2\x91cause her eyes keep\ngoing like this. (He closes his eyes and moves them around, kinda like he\xc2\x92s been\nprocessed by the devil, or something.)'
Chandler	 (entering with Rachel) I\xc2\x92m telling ya, Joanna\xc2\x92s got it all\nwrong. Okay? All I said was, \xc2\x91This was fun. Let\xc2\x92s do it again sometime.\nI\xc2\x92ll give you a call.\xc2\x92'
Rachel	 Ohh, gee. I wonder why she thinks you\xc2\x92re going to call her?'
Chandler	 That\xc2\x92s what you say at the end of a date.'
Rachel	 You can\xc2\x92t just say, \xc2\x91Nice to meet you, good night?\xc2\x92'
Chandler	 To her face? Look it\xc2\x92s the end of the date, I\xc2\x92m standing\nthere, I know all she\xc2\x92s waiting for is for me to say \xc2\x91I\xc2\x92ll call her\xc2\x92\nand it\xc2\x92s just y'know, comes out. I can\xc2\x92t help it, it\xc2\x92s a compulsion."
Monica	 Come on Rach, when a guy says he\xc2\x92s going to call, it doesn\xc2\x92t\nmean he\xc2\x92s going to call. Hasn\xc2\x92t it ever happened to you?'
Rachel	 Well, they always called.'
Monica	 Hmm, bite me.'
Joanna	 (entering) Did he call?'
Rachel	 No. Sorry.'
Joanna	 Why?! Why?! He said he\xc2\x92d call. Why hasn\xc2\x92t he called?'
Sophie	 Maybe he\xc2\x92s intimated by really smart, strong, successful women.'
Joanna	 Sophie, would you please climb out of my butt. Why hasn\xc2\x92t he\ncalled, Rachel? Why?'
Rachel	 Okay, okay. Umm, well ah, maybe he, maybe he feels awkward because you\nare my boss.'
Joanna	 Awkward? Why should he feel awkward?'
Rachel	 Well...'
Joanna	 The only person that should feel awkward is you, and you didn\xc2\x92t\ntell him not to call me, did you?'
Rachel	 No. I...'
Joanna	 Because if you feel uncomfortable with your friend dating someone you\nwork for, there are always ways to fix...that.'
Rachel	 (grabbing the magazine out of his hands) Call her! Call her now!'
Chandler	 Multiple, so many paper cuts.'
Rachel	 Why hasn\xc2\x92t he called Rachel? Why? Why? I don\xc2\x92t understand.\nWhy? He said he\xc2\x92ll call. Why? Why? Chandler I\xc2\x92m telling you she has flipped out,\nshe\xc2\x92s gone crazy!'
Chandler	 (sarcastic) Oh, well give me the phone then.'
Rachel	 Come on, this isn\xc2\x92t funny. She thinks it\xc2\x92s my fault that you\nhaven\xc2\x92t called her. You have to call her!'
Chandler	 Look, you can\xc2\x92t call somebody after this long just to say,\n\xc2\x91In case you didn\xc2\x92t notice, I don\xc2\x92t like you!\xc2\x92'
Rachel	 Well then you\xc2\x92re going to have to take her out again.'
Chandler	 Nooo!! She\xc2\x92s really dull! And she gets this gross mascara goop\nthing in the corner of her eye!'
Rachel	 I don\xc2\x92t care! I don\xc2\x92t care! You are going to have to take her\nout again and end it, and end it in way that she knows it\xc2\x92s actually ended. And, I\ndon\xc2\x92t care how hard it is for you, do not tell her that you will call her again!'
Chandler	 All right! Fine! But it\xc2\x92s just a lunch date, no more than an\nhour! And from now on I get my own dates, I don\xc2\x92t want you setting me up with anybody\never again!'
Rachel	 That\xc2\x92s fine!'
Chandler	 That\xc2\x92s just a lot of big talk, y'know."
Rachel	 I know.'
Ross	 Mon?'
Monica	 (from the bathroom) I\xc2\x92m in the shower!'
Ross	 Oh, fire! There, there\xc2\x92s a fire! Fire!!'
Joey	 Hey.'
Kate	 Hi.'
Joey	 So I ah, talked to Lauren, kinda told her how things were with us. Did you\nah, did you talk to Marshall?'
Kate	 About what?'
Joey	 Y'know, about what happened with us."
Kate	 Nooo. And there\xc2\x92s really no reason he should find out, so ah\nlet\xc2\x92s not make a big deal about it, okay?'
Joey	 What are you talking about? It was a big deal. I mean, come on you\ncan\xc2\x92t tell me last night didn\xc2\x92t mean something to you. I-I was there,\nyou\xc2\x92re not that good an actress.'
Kate	 Look umm, I, I was, I was just caught up in the moment. That\xc2\x92s all it\nwas. Joey, I\xc2\x92m-I\xc2\x92m sorry you feel bad, but haven\xc2\x92t you ever sleep with a\nwomen where it meant more to her than it did to you?'
Joey	 Nooo.'
Lauren	 (entering) Hi, Kate!'
Kate	 Hi, Lauren.'
Joey	 Hi, Lauren.'
Lauren	 Hi, pig!'
Ross	 Sorry I ah, I scared you in there.'
Monica	 Oh, that\xc2\x92s okay. By the way, I was just checking the shower\nmassager.'
Ross	 Yeah.'
Phoebe	 (entering) Hey!'
Monica	 (runs over to her) I tried to reach you at work. There\xc2\x92s....been a\nfire.'
Phoebe	 What?! Oh my... (sees the remains of the house) Oh my God!! What\nhappened?!'
Ross	 Well, we believe it originated here. (He uses a pointer and points to the\npoint of origin.) In the Aroma Room.'
Phoebe	 All right. Did everyone get out okay?'
Monica	 Well, the giraffe\xc2\x92s okay. And so is the pirate.'
Phoebe	 Ohh. What is this? (She sees a tissue covering something, and moves to\nremove it.)'
Ross	 No Phoebe, don\xc2\x92t look! You don\xc2\x92t want to see what\xc2\x92s under\nthere!!'
Phoebe	 (She pauses to ready herself, and removes the tissue.) Ohh, the-the\nFoster puppets! '
Chandler	 It\xc2\x92s not a big deal. It\xc2\x92s, just it\xc2\x92s right here,\n(points to his eye) and it\xc2\x92s all the time.'
Joanna	 Well, thanks again for lunch.'
Chandler	 (He looks over at Rachel, who nods her head) Yes, this, this was\npleasant.'
Joanna	 It was, wasn\xc2\x92t it?'
Chandler	 The food there was, was great.'
Joanna	 Wasn\xc2\x92t it?'
Chandler	 So take care.'
Joanna	 You too.'
Chandler	 Well, this was great. I\xc2\x92ll give you a call. We should do it again\nsometime. (Rachel is disappointed) '
Joanna	 Great! I\xc2\x92m looking forward to it. Rachel, any messages?'
Rachel	 Sophie\xc2\x92s desk.'
Rachel	 (whispering) Chandler!! Are you gonna call her!'
Chandler	 Noo! '
Rachel	 Chandler!!'
Chandler	 Look, I\xc2\x92m sorry. Okay? I\xc2\x92m weak, and pathetic, and sorry.'
Rachel	 Okay, you are going to tell her and you\xc2\x92re going to tell her now.\n(She grabs his nipple and starts to twist it.)'
Chandler	 Ahhhh\xc2\x97I\xc2\x92m not going to call you.'
Joanna	 What?'
Chandler	 I\xc2\x92m sorry. I\xc2\x92m-I\xc2\x92m-I\xc2\x92m sorry that I said I was\ngoing to when I\xc2\x92m not. Look, this has nothing to do with you, y'know? And this\nisn\xc2\x92t Rachel\xc2\x92s fault. It\xc2\x92s me. I have serious, serious problems when it\ncomes to women. I have issues with commitment, intimacy, (pause) mascara goop. And\nI\xc2\x92m really sorry, it\xc2\x92s just that this is not, this isn\xc2\x92t going to work out."
Joanna	 Well, this isn\xc2\x92t how I was hoping how this would end, but I guess I\nhave to appreciate your honesty.'
Chandler	 Yeah, o-okay.'
Joanna	 So...'
Chandler	 Well this is great! I\xc2\x92ll give you a call! We should do it again\nsometime!'

Joey	 (on phone) Well, so anyway Beth, what I\xc2\x92m saying is I should\xc2\x92ve\nconsidered your feelings before I went home with you that night. I\xc2\x92ve ah, I\xc2\x92ve\nrecently learned what\xc2\x92s it like to be on your side of it, and I\xc2\x92m sorry. So, do\nyou think you can forgive me? (listens) Great. Thanks. Okay, bye. (He sits down and\ncrosses out something, and dials the phone again.) Hello, Jennifer? (listens) Oh hi, Mrs.\nLoreo, is Jennifer there? (listens) Oh, she\xc2\x92s not home huh? (listens) Well ah,\nactually I kinda need to talk to you too.'
