Monica	 Okay, the reason why I asked you guys out to brunch today is because I\nhave been doing some thinking about who should be my maid of honor.'
Rachel	 Oh my God! This is it! (She and Phoebe hold hands.) (To Phoebe) I really\nhope it\xc2\x92s you!'
Phoebe	 I hope it\xc2\x92s you.'
Rachel	 Me too!'
Monica	 First of all um, I love you both so much and you\xc2\x92re both so\nimportant to me\xc2\x85'
Rachel	 Okay, bla-bla-bla-bla!! Who is it?!'
Monica	 Well umm, I was thinking that maybe we could come up with a system where\nwe trade of being maid of honor for each other. Like hypothetically, if Phoebe were\nmine\xc2\x85'
Phoebe	 Yes!!! Oh!!'
Rachel	 Hypothetically!'
Phoebe	 Still.'
Monica	 If Phoebe were my maid of honor\xc2\x85'
Rachel	 Uh-hmm.'
Monica	 Rachel would be Phoebe\xc2\x92s, I would be Rachel\xc2\x92s, that way we all\nget to do it once and no one would get upset.'
Rachel	 Yeah that\xc2\x92s actually a pretty good idea.'
Phoebe	 Yeah, I\xc2\x92ll do that. So who gets to be yours?'
Monica	 (laughs) Well that\xc2\x92s the best part. Umm, you guys get to\ndecide!'
Phoebe	 Wh-why is that the best part?'
Monica	 Because then I don\xc2\x92t have to!'
Rachel	 Well of course we will help you decide! We will do anything we\ncan to help you! Now, I would like to make a toast, to the future Mrs. Chandler Bing (A\nwoman at the table behind them overhears Chandler\xc2\x92s name and starts listening\ncloser), my best friend, and truly one of the nicest people that\xc2\x85'
Monica	 I\xc2\x92m really not deciding!'
Rachel	 Fine!'
Monica	 Yeah that\xc2\x92s right.'
Phoebe	 Aww, and good luck to you too! (To Monica and Rachel) What a nice lady!'

Chandler	 Die Hard still great!'
Joey	 Yep. Hey, what do you say we make it a double feature?'
Chandler	 What\xc2\x92d you rent?'
Joey	 Die Hard 2.'
Chandler	 (looking at the tape) Joey, this is Die Hard 1 again.'
Joey	 Oh, well we watch it a second time and its Die Hard 2!'
Ross	 Joey, we just saw it!'
Joey	 And?'
Ross	 And it\xc2\x92ll be cool to see it again! Yeah!'
Joey and Ross	 Die Hard!!!!!!'
Ross	 Dude, you didn\xc2\x92t say Die Hard. Is everything okay?'
Chandler	 Yeah, I just got uh, got plans.'
Ross	 Well, John McLane had plans!'
Chandler	 No, see the thing is I want to get out of here before Joey gets all\nworked up and starts calling everybody bitch.'
Joey	 What are you talking about? Bitch.'
Phoebe	 Hey Rachel?'
Rachel	 Yeah?'
Phoebe	 Umm, when I get married will you be my maid of honor?'
Rachel	 Really?!'
Phoebe	 Uh-hmm.'
Rachel	 Oh my God Phoebe! I mean I\xc2\x92m just\xc2\x97Wait a minute. If I\xc2\x92m\nyour maid of honor that means you are Monica\xc2\x92s.'
Phoebe	 Oh! Well, if that\xc2\x92s what you want\xc2\x85'
Rachel	 Ohh! No way Phoebe! I want to be Monica\xc2\x92s!'
Phoebe	 But why does it even matter?!'
Rachel	 Why does it matter so much to you?!'
Phoebe	 Because this one is now! And-and it\xc2\x92s two of our best\nfriends! Who knows what you\xc2\x92re gonna marry!'
Rachel	 What-what if I marry Ross\xc2\x97Or Joey?'
Phoebe	 (gasps) You wouldn\xc2\x92t! Okay look, Rachel I know you really want to\ndo this, but I-I\xc2\x92ve never been maid of honor to anyone before! And I know you\xc2\x92ve\ndone it at least twice!'
Rachel	 Yeah but Phoebe\xc2\x85'
Phoebe	 And no, oh please, oh please let me finish. (Rachel stops talking.) Oh I\nguess that was it.'
Rachel	 Okay. Okay. It\xc2\x92s\xc2\x97since you\xc2\x92ve never done it before you\ncan be Monica\xc2\x92s made of honor.'
Phoebe	 Oh, thank you so much! (They hug.) Okay.'
Rachel	 I\xc2\x92m gonna marry someone good y\xc2\x92know.'
Phoebe	 Oh I know.'
Rachel	 Better than Chandler. (Phoebe exhales as if to say, "Like what\nisn\xc2\x92t?")'
[Scene	 Ross's apartment, Die Hard has ended, only I don\xc2\x92t think Joey and\nRoss know that yet. As you see, they are both asleep. And they\xc2\x92re on the same couch.\nWhich means they\xc2\x92re sleeping together. Not like Joey is at one end and Ross is on the\nother, they both happen to be lying down and sleeping together. Well, there hasn\xc2\x92t\nbeen any clothes removed so not that kind of sleeping together. Not that\nthere\xc2\x92s anything wrong with that. That is unless you\xc2\x92re a Republican in which\nthat kind of thing will bring about the downfall of Western society, especially if they\nshould happen to want to get married. Anyway, let me recap. No, there is too much, let me\nsum up. Ross and Joey are taking a nap together on top of each other and both wake-up at\nthe same time, realize what they just did, scream, and jump up.]"
Ross	 What happened?!!'
Joey	 Well, I don\xc2\x92t know!!'
Ross	 We fell asleep! That is all.'
Joey	 Yeah. Yep. Yeah. All right, well uh, I\xc2\x92d better go.'
Ross	 I think that would be best.'
Joey	 Yeah. All right, I\xc2\x92ll talk to you later.'
Ross	 Okay. But not about this!'
Joey	 No! Never! Never! (Pause, then Joey wants to shake Ross\xc2\x92s hand.) Bye.'
Ross	 No touch! No touch!'
Monica	 Yeah hey, a weird thing happened today whey I was at brunch. This woman\noverheard that I was marrying you and-and then she\xc2\x85she wished me good luck.'
Chandler	 That\xc2\x92s sweet.'
Monica	 No, it\xc2\x92s more like a (sarcastically) good luck.'
Chandler	 So uh, what did this woman look like?'
Monica	 She was like 30, dark hair, attractive.'
Chandler	 Well, is there any chance you were looking into a bright, shiny thing\ncalled a mirror?'
Monica	 Come on, was it somebody maybe you dated in college?'
Chandler	 No, no I only dated two girls in college, both blonde, both not\nattractive\xc2\x85 (Thinks a little while.) Hold on one second; let me check this out. (He\ngets up and grabs a photo album.'
Monica	 What are you doing?'
Chandler	 Well, let\xc2\x92s see\xc2\x85 (Finding the picture he wants.) Okay uh, is\nthat her? (Pointing to the picture.)'
Monica	 Oh my God yes! Who is she?'
Chandler	 Julie Grath, my camp girlfriend.'
Monica	 Did you break up with her?'
Chandler	 (pause) No, we\xc2\x92re still together. Yeah we went out for two\nsummers, and then I broke up with her.'
Monica	 Why?'
Chandler	 Well, \xc2\x91cause she came back the third summer and she\xc2\x92d gotten\nreally fa-aa-aw-ow\xc2\x85'
Monica	 Fat?!'
Chandler	 I did not say fat! I said, "Fa-aa-aw-ow\xc2\x85"'
Monica	 You broke up with a girl because she was fat?!'
Chandler	 Yeah. Yeah, but it was a really, really long time ago! Does she still\nfeel bad?'
Monica	 Well, apparently she does.'
Chandler	 Well, you know what they say, elephants never forget. (Monica is not\namused by that statement.) Seriously, good luck marrying me.'
Joey	 Hey! What\xc2\x92s going on?'
Rachel	 Phoebe is gonna be Monica\xc2\x92s maid of honor!'
Joey	 Hey! Well I hope it goes better than the last time you did it for that\ngirl downstairs, remember? (Phoebe glares at him.)'
Rachel	 (shocked) You have been maid of honor before?!!'
Phoebe	 See? This is exactly why you shouldn\xc2\x92t lie!'
Rachel	 All right that\xc2\x92s it! I am maid of honor!'
Phoebe	 Na-uh, I am!'
Rachel	 How come you are?!'
Phoebe	 Because I cared enough to lie!'
Joey	 Hey-hey-hey-hey, I can help you decide who should do it! Yeah, we could\nhave like uh, like an audition and see how you\xc2\x92d handle maid of honor type\nsituations.'
Phoebe	 What are you talking about?'
Joey	 Like when I want a job, I go to an audition and if I\xc2\x92m the best of\nthe people they see, they give me the part.'
Phoebe	 Okay, so after this audition, who decides who gets it?'
Joey	 Oh uh, me and Ross can be the judges.'
Phoebe	 (To Rachel) Well, it\xc2\x92s better than us deciding.'
Rachel	 Oh, come on! This is crazy! Can\xc2\x92t we just flip a coin?!'
Phoebe	 No! Coins hate me!'
Rachel	 Okay. Okay fine, y\xc2\x92know what? We will let Ross and Joey decide.\n(Ross enters.) (In a sexy voice.) Hiiiii, Ross! Sweetie.'
Phoebe	 Hey there, you handsome thing. (Rachel and Phoebe exit.)'
Ross	 Wow, this cologne really is every bit as good as Georgio. '
Joey	 Hi.'
Ross	 Just uh, brought back your videos.'
Joey	 Uh hey look uh Ross, look I think we need to talk about before.'
Ross	 No! No we don\xc2\x92t!'
Joey	 Yes we do! Now look, that was the best nap I ever had!! '
Ross	 I\xc2\x85 I don\xc2\x92t know what you are talking about.'
Joey	 Come on! Admit it! That was the best nap you ever had!'
Ross	 I\xc2\x92ve had better.'
Joey	 Okay! When?!'
Ross	 All right! All right! It was the best nap ever!'
Joey	 Uh-huh!'
Ross	 I\xc2\x92ve said it! Okay?! But it\xc2\x92s over Joey!'
Joey	 I want to do it again.'
Ross	 We can\xc2\x92t do it again.'
Joey	 Why not?'
Ross	 Because it\xc2\x92s weird!'
Joey	 Fine! Do you want something to drink?'
Ross	 Sure, what do you got?'
Joey	 Warm milk and Excedrin P.M. (Ross just leaves.)'

Monica	 Chandler! (Knocks on the door.) Chandler! I just figured out who you\nare!'
Chandler	 Can you figure out what I\xc2\x92m doing?'
Monica	 You\xc2\x92re Lewis Posin.'
Chandler	 Who?'
Monica	 Lewis Posin! He was my best friend in fifth grade, and-and then one day\nI asked him to be my boyfriend and he said no. Do you know why?'
Chandler	 Because you kept talking to him while he was trying to go to the\nbathroom?!'
Monica	 No! But because he thought I was to faaaaa\xc2\x85. (Chandler emerges,\nwithout flushing by the way.) And every time I think about it, it makes me feel as bad as\nI did in fifth grade! Y\xc2\x92know, I-I really think that you should apologize to Julie.'
Chandler	 What? Are you kidding? That was like 16 years ago.'
Monica	 No, I know. But y\xc2\x92know what? It would make me feel better if Lewis\napologized to me.'
Chandler	 Okay, I will do it. But I have to warn you; this may make me a better\nperson and that is not the man you feel in love with!'
Joey	 Okay, all right, this is how it\xc2\x92s going to work. We\xc2\x92re gonna\ngive you hypothetical maid of honor situations and you will be scored on a scale of 1 to\n10, 1 being the highest.'
Ross	 No, 10 is the highest.'
Joey	 Why is 10 the highest?'
Ross	 Because it\xc2\x92s the highest. (Joey shrugs his shoulders) Okay, Rachel\nyou\xc2\x92re up first. (Rachel stands up and gets ready.) Situation No. 1
Joey	 (crying) I don\xc2\x92t want to marry Chandler!'
Rachel	 Okay, uh\xc2\x85'
Joey	 I\xc2\x92ve got cold feet.'
Rachel	 \xc2\x85it\xc2\x92s gonna be okay!'
Joey	 No, one man for the rest of my life? I don\xc2\x92t know if I can do it!\nThis means I\xc2\x92ll never get to sleep with Joey!'
Rachel	 Look Monica, getting cold feet is very common. Y\xc2\x92know,\nit\xc2\x92s-it\xc2\x92s just because of all the anticipation and you just have to remember\nthat you love Chandler. And also, I ran out on a wedding. You don\xc2\x92t get to keep the\ngifts.'
Joey	 (out of his Monica character) Very good! Drawing on your own experience, I\nlike that!'
Rachel	 Thanks!'
Ross	 Yes, very nice Rachel.'
Rachel	 Thank you judges.'
Phoebe	 Ugh, what a kiss ass.'
Rachel	 Oh!'
Joey	 Okay, Phoebe\xc2\x85'
Phoebe	 Yes! Your honor?'
Joey	 We\xc2\x92re now in the ceremony, Monica is about to say, "I do"\nwhen her drunk uncle starts yelling. What do you do? Go!'
Ross	 (playing the drunk uncle) When Monica was a little girl, I remember\nthat\xc2\x97(Phoebe screams and tackles him)\xc2\x97Ooh!! Ow! Very good!'
Phoebe	 Oh!'
Joey	 Yes! Excellent! Perfect score!'
Rachel	 Wait a minute! She just made a scene in the middle of the ceremony!'
Phoebe	 Hey! Do you want do you want a little taste of Pheebs?!'
Ross	 It is time for you to give your maid of honor speech.'
Rachel	 Ohh, wait a minute, we haven\xc2\x92t pre\xc2\x85'
Ross	 Go!'
Rachel	 Okay! Okay! Umm, Webster\xc2\x92s Dictionary defines marriage\nas\xc2\x85 (Ross and Joey start writing.) Okay!! Forget that! That sucks!! Okay, never mind!\nForget it! Umm, umm, okay, uh\xc2\x85 I met, I-I met, I met Monica when we were just a\ncouple of six year olds and I became friends with Chandler when he was 25, although he\nseemed like a six year old.'
Ross and Joey	 Oh! That\xc2\x92s nice.'
Rachel	 Thank you. Thank you very much. Umm, I\xc2\x92ve known them separately and\nI\xc2\x92ve known them together and-and to know them as a couple is to know that you are\ntruly in the presence of love. So I would like to raise my glass (Grabs a glass and holds\nit up) to Monica and Chandler and the beautiful adventure they are about to embark upon\ntogether. I can think of no two people better prepared for the journey.'
Joey	 Wow. (To Ross) Good speech.'
Ross	 Yeah, it really was!'
Rachel	 Aw, thanks!'
Ross	 Okay Phoebe, I guess you\xc2\x92re next (To Joey) although I really\ndon\xc2\x92t see the point.'
Joey	 Yeah.'
Phoebe	 Okay, I can\xc2\x92t believe that Monica and Chandler are getting married.\nI remember talking about this day with Rachel while we were showering together, naked.\n(Raises her glass and drinks.)'
Joey	 And she\xc2\x92s back in the game.'
Chandler	 (she opens the door) Julie hi! Chandler Bing, I, I guess you remember\nme.'
Julie	 Hello Skidmark.'
Chandler	 (To Monica) It\xc2\x92s a nickname, I\xc2\x92ll explain later.'
Monica	 It\xc2\x92s pretty clear.'
Chandler	 Ah, uh, I owe you a long overdue apology. I never should have broken\nup with you because you were overweight.'
Julie	 That\xc2\x92s why you broke up with me?'
Chandler	 You-you-you didn\xc2\x92t know that. (Pause as she nods no.) Well, I\nguess my work here is done!'
Joey	 All right, well first of all I would like to say that you both performed\nvery well. Okay? You should be proud of yourselves. And-and I would also like to say that\nin this competition there are no losers. Well, except for Rachel\xc2\x97Damnit!'
Phoebe	 Really?! I won!'
Rachel	 What?!'
Ross	 I\xc2\x92m sorry Rach, it was, it was really close.'
Rachel	 Well then I demand a recount! (Hmm, I wonder where I\xc2\x92ve heard that\nbefore.)'
Ross	 Actually, it wasn\xc2\x92t that close.'
Rachel	 No! Y\xc2\x92know what? No! No! You thing was so stupid anyway, this was\nridiculous\xc2\x97We\xc2\x92re gonna flip a coin! (Phoebe gasps.) All right?! (She flips the\ncoin.) Heads! (Looks at the coin and grunts in disgust.)'
Phoebe	 The coins have finally forgiven me!'
Rachel	 Well y\xc2\x92know what? I hope Monica forgives you after you throw her,\nher vegetarian, voodoo, goddess circley shower! (Runs out.)'
Phoebe	 (running after her) Rach, it\xc2\x92s gonna be okay! (To Ross and Joey)\nYou guys are the best!'
Joey	 Boy I tell ya, that judging stuff took a lot out of me.'
Ross	 Yeah?'
Joey	 Yeah! I was thinking about maybe going upstairs and taking a little nap on\nmy couch. (Raises his eyebrows, questioning Ross to see if he wants to join him.) '
Ross	 Why-why would I care about that?'
Joey	 No reason, I\xc2\x92m just saying that uh\xc2\x85 That\xc2\x92s where I\xc2\x92ll\nbe. '
Chandler	 As bad as that went I actually enjoyed myself. I think that I\xc2\x92m\ngoing to apologize for all of the stupid things I do.'
Monica	 Why don\xc2\x92t you just stop doing stupid things? Then you wouldn\xc2\x92t\nhave to apologize.'
Chandler	 I would really love it if could do both.'
Monica	 All right, I\xc2\x85I have to ask.'
Chandler	 What?'
Monica	 Are you gonna break up with me if I get fat again?'
Chandler	 What?!'
Monica	 Well, you broke up with Julie Grath! How much weight could she have\ngained?'
Chandler	 A hundred and forty-five pounds.'
Monica	 In one year?! My God what did she eat? Her-her family! That\xc2\x92s not\nthe point.'
Chandler	 Look I know it was a stupid reason to break up with somebody, but I\nwas 15!'
Monica	 Well\xc2\x85 That\xc2\x92s not the only time this was an issue. You remember\nwhen umm, you spent Thanksgiving with us? You called me fat.'
Chandler	 Okay. Okay, now wait a minute that was totally different.'
Monica	 How?'
Chandler	 You were not supposed to hear that! I said that behind you back!'
Monica	 What if I have babies, okay? I mean I\xc2\x92m gonna look different.\nI\xc2\x92m okay with that, but I\xc2\x92m not sure that you are!'
Chandler	 Look you have to realize I don\xc2\x92t think of you as a thin,\nbeautiful woman. (Monica glares at him.) See this is one of things that I can apologize\nfor later! Look, what I mean is you\xc2\x92re Monica! Okay? And I am in love with Monica. '
Monica	 Keep going.'
Chandler	 So you can balloon up or you can shrink down and I will still love\nyou.'
Monica	 Even if I shrink down to two inches tall?'
Chandler	 I\xc2\x92d carry you around in my pocket.'
Monica	 I love you. (They hug and kiss.)'
Chandler	 Skidmark\xc2\x92s still got a way with the ladies.'
Rachel	 Hi Pheebs.'
Phoebe	 Hi!'
Rachel	 Hi! I just want to apologize. I\xc2\x92m really sorry I was a baby.'
Phoebe	 That\xc2\x92s ridiculous Rachel, we were all babies once. (Rachel looks at\nher.) Oh, you mean today.'
Rachel	 Yeah. Yeah, and y\xc2\x92know you-you deserve to win. And-and y\xc2\x92know\nI was thinking about it, if-if you\xc2\x92re Monica\xc2\x92s maid of honor that means I get to\nbe yours.'
Phoebe	 Oh yeah!'
Rachel	 Yeah! Oh, umm when-when Monica and Chandler got engaged I started\nputting some stuff together, y\xc2\x92know just in case\xc2\x85'
Phoebe	 Oh that\xc2\x92s so sweet thanks.'
Rachel	 Here is a book of poetry that I know Monica loves. And-and ohh God this\nis funny, look, this is a picture of one Halloween where she dressed up as a bride. (Shows\nPhoebe the picture.) And look, she made me carry her train, which was weird because I was Wonder\nWoman. Oh and here\xc2\x92s a little purse that I found. (Hands her the purse)\nY\xc2\x92know I just thought that maybe they could hold the rings in there.'
Phoebe	 Ohh.'
Rachel	 And umm, vintage handkerchiefs y\xc2\x92know \xc2\x91cause, people cry at\nweddings. (Starting to cry.) I\xc2\x92m just gonna grab a couple of these.'
Phoebe	 This stuff is great!'
Rachel	 Oh, I forgot this was in here. Umm, this was the uh garter that I was\nsaving for my wedding and I wanted it to be Monica\xc2\x92s something borrowed and it\xc2\x92s\nblue. (Starts to cry again.) Yeah\xc2\x85'
Phoebe	 Y\xc2\x92know Rach, I think that, I think you should be Monica\xc2\x92s made\nof honor.'
Rachel	 You do? Why?'
Phoebe	 Because I think it means more to you.'
Rachel	 But Pheebs, y\xc2\x92know you earned it.'
Phoebe	 Its fine. I mean, this is something that you\xc2\x92ve been thinking about\nsince you were what, 14? (She\xc2\x92s referring to the Halloween picture.)'
Rachel	 No, I was ten. I just developed early.'
Phoebe	 (looking at the picture again) Man alive!'
Monica	 (entering) Hey, what\xc2\x92s going on?'
Rachel	 Hey!'
Phoebe	 Well, we just decided that Rachel is gonna be your maid of honor.'
Monica	 (gasps) Ohh, wow! That\xc2\x92s great! (Rachel and Monica hug.) Oh wow! We\nreally have to start planning! I have, I have a lot of really specific ideas! We should\nprobably get together like four times per week. You can come over to my place; we\xc2\x92ll\nget together before work! What do you say, 6
Rachel	 Yeah okay, you laugh now, but she\xc2\x92s gonna be yours. (Phoebe gets\nsuddenly scared.)'

Joey	 Great nap.'
Ross	 It really was.'
Joey	 (reacting first by jumping up) Dude! What the hell are you doing?! God!\n(Heads for his room leaving Ross.)'
Ross	 (slowly stands up and says quietly) Excuse me. (Exits.)'
