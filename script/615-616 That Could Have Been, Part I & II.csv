Rachel	 Hey, you guys! Guess what? Barry and Mindy are getting a divorce!'
Monica	 Oh my God!'
Phoebe	 Wow!'
Joey	 (To Ross) What is the matter with you?!'
Phoebe	 No! Barry and Mindy.'
Joey	 Oh sorry, I hear divorce I immediately go to Ross. (To Rachel)\nWho-who\xc2\x92s Barry and Mindy?'
Rachel	 Barry was the guy that I was almost married and Mindy was my best\nfriend.'
Joey	 Ohh-oh, wasn\xc2\x92t he cheating on you with her?'
Rachel	 Yeah, but that just means that he was falling asleep on top of her\ninstead of me.'
Monica	 Why did they get divorced?'
Rachel	 Well, apparently she caught him cheating on her with someone else.\nIsn\xc2\x92t that sad? (Giggles.) God, could you imagine if I actually married him?! I mean\nhow different would my life be?'
Ross	 I know what you mean, I\xc2\x92ve always wondered how different my life\nwould be if-if I\xc2\x92d never gotten divorced.'
Phoebe	 Which time?'
Ross	 The first time! No seriously, imagine if Carol hadn\xc2\x92t realized she\nwas a lesbian.'
Joey	 (starts to imagine it) I can\xc2\x92t. I keep seeing it the good way.'
Ross	 I\xc2\x92d bet I\xc2\x92d still be doing my kara-tay. (That\xc2\x92s karate,\nhe\xc2\x92s just saying it that way.) Towards the end of our marriage I was doing a lot of\nkara-tay as a way of releasing the tension from y\xc2\x92know, not doing anything else\nphysical.'
Chandler	 Maybe the problem was you were pronouncing it kara-tay.'
Monica	 And what if I was still fat? (To Chandler) Well, you wouldn\xc2\x92t be\ndating me, that\xc2\x92s for sure.'
Chandler	 Sure I would!'
All	 (simultaneously) Oh yeah! Come on! Yeah right!'
Chandler	 What, you guys really think that I\xc2\x92m that shallow?'
Ross	 No, I just think Monica was that fat.'
Joey	 Hey, imagine if I never got fired off Days Of Our Lives! (Closes\nhis eyes to do so.) Oh-hey, there\xc2\x92s Carol again!'
Chandler	 What if I had had the guts to quit my job? I\xc2\x92d probably be\nwriting for the New Yorker, getting paid to be funny. But my job\xc2\x92s fun too! I\nmean tomorrow, I-I don\xc2\x92t have to wear a tie.'
Phoebe	 What if I had taken that job at Merrill Lynch?'
Ross	 What?!'
Rachel	 Merrill Lynch?'
Phoebe	 Yeah, I had a massage client who worked there and-and he said I had a\nknack for stocks.'
Rachel	 Well why didn\xc2\x92t you take the job?'
Phoebe	 Because at that time you see, I thought everything that rhymed was true.\nSo I thought y\xc2\x92know that if I\xc2\x92d work with stocks, I\xc2\x92d have to live in a\nbox, and only eat lox, and have a pet fox.'
Ross	 Hey, do you guys think that if all those things happened, we\xc2\x92d still\nhang out?'

{Transcriber\xc2\x92s note	 This is where the opening credits are, but they\xc2\x92re not\nthe usual opening credits. Oh no! These credits are based on the world that would\nhave been created had all of the above actually happened. It starts out with all of them\nat the fountain sitting on the couch as Fat Monica runs up and sits on the arm of the\ncouch, tilting the whole thing towards her. It then goes on to show Rachel\xc2\x92s still a\nshop-aholic and with Barry. Fat Monica is sweating while cooking and dancing while eating\na donut. Phoebe as the Wall Street shark smoking while on two cell phones. Then\nthey\xc2\x92re dancing in the fountain. Joey entering as Dr. Drake Remoray and meeting a\ngroupie. Chandler trying to write as a bird does its business on his shoulder and falling\nasleep while typing. Ross doing some kara-tay and trying to get Carol into bed. And\nfinally, some more dancing in the fountain, them all flexing, and the turning out the lamp\nand shutting off all the lights bit from the first season. Just remember one thing, this\nis an alternate universe. Everything from every other episode doesn\xc2\x92t apply, for\ninstance, Ross and Rachel have no history. And in fact have not seen each other in years\nin this world.}'
Ross	 (recognizing her) Oh my God! Rachel Green?'
Rachel	 (gasps) Rob Tillman!'
Ross	 No-no. It\xc2\x92s-it\xc2\x92s me, Ross!'
Rachel	 Oh, I\xc2\x92m sorry. Ross Tillman.'
Ross	 No, no-no, Ross Geller.'
Rachel	 Ohh, of course Monica\xc2\x92s brother!'
Ross	 Yeah. Right.'
Rachel	 Wow! How are you?!'
Ross	 Good-good, I\xc2\x92m-I\xc2\x92m married. (Shows her his ring.)'
Rachel	 Ohh! Me too!'
Ross	 Is-isn\xc2\x92t it the best?'
Rachel	 Oh, it\xc2\x92s the best! (They both exhale contemplating the joys of\nmarriage.) So, umm how\xc2\x92s Monica?'
Ross	 Oh really, really great! Yeah! A-actually she\xc2\x92s right down the\nstreet, umm, do-do you know what? You should stop bye and say hi.'
Rachel	 Ohh, I would love too.'
Ross	 Yeah? Oh-oh, she\xc2\x92d be so excited!'
Rachel	 Ohh! Okay!'
Ross	 Come on! (They start to leave.)'
Rachel	 Oh wait, don\xc2\x92t you have to pay for your, (looks at his magazine)\nBusty Ladies?'
Ross	 No, it\xc2\x92s okay. Some-some kid asked me to pick it up for him, but I\ndon\xc2\x92t\xc2\x85'
Rachel	 (laughs) Oh yeah? Okay.'
Ross	 (putting the magazine back and holding the money for it) Okay.'
Rachel	 But! Don\xc2\x92t you have to give him his money back?'
Ross	 Uh-huh. (Steps to a random kid nearby and hands him his money.) Hey, here\nyou go buddy. Sorry, no porn for you. (To Rachel) Okay, let\xc2\x92s go see Monica!'
Joey	 So Monica, still going out with Dr. Boring huh?'
Monica	 He\xc2\x92s not boring! He\xc2\x92s just-he\xc2\x92s just low key.'
Monica's Boyfriend	 (returning) Here we go, one Hazelnut Latte. (Hands it to\nMonica and sits down.)"
Monica	 Thanks.'
Monica's Boyfriend	 Yeah. Y\xc2\x92know, the hazelnut actually not a nut,\nit\xc2\x92s a seed."
Joey	 (not impressed) Wow!!'
Monica's Boyfriend	 Can anyone else name a well known seed that\xc2\x92s been\nmasquerading as a nut?"
Joey	 Oh dear God, let me think. (Starts to sarcastically think about it.)'
Chandler	 (entering, depressed) Hey.'
Joey	 Hey.'
Monica	 Oh no! What\xc2\x92s the matter?'
Chandler	 Oh I just got another rejection letter. They said my writing was\nfunny, just not "Archie Comic funny."'
Monica's Boyfriend	 Y\xc2\x92know what honey? I got to get back to the hospital."
Monica	 Okay.'
Monica's Boyfriend	 (kisses her) Okay."
Monica	 Bye.'
Monica's Boyfriend	 Bye-bye. (Gets up to leave.) Oh uh, by the way, the answer\nis, the Brazil nut. (Exits.)"
Chandler	 Was his question what\xc2\x92s more boring than him?'
Joey	 Hey man, look sorry about that Archie thing. Do uh, do you need me\nto give you some money?'
Chandler	 Hey, I may have no money, but I still have my pride.'
Joey	 Really?'
Chandler	 Ehh.'
Monica	 Maybe Joey doesn\xc2\x92t have to give you the money, TV stars have\nassistants right?'
Joey	 That\xc2\x92s an idea! (To Chandler) Hey, if I hired an assistant,\nwould-would you take money from her?'
Monica	 No Joey! Chandler could be your assistant! See, he could answer all of\nyour fan mail and stuff!'
Joey	 That\xc2\x92s great! That would be great! Let\xc2\x92s do that!'
Chandler	 I could use the money; it could give me time to write.'
Joey	 Oh right great! Welcome aboard!'
Chandler	 Okay!'
Joey	 All right! Now hey, I need to use the bathroom. Since I don\xc2\x92t need\nany assistance in there, take a break!'
Chandler	 All right!'
Phoebe	 (entering) Hey!'
Monica	 Hey Phoebe! Guess what?'
Phoebe	 What?'
Monica	 Joey just hired Chandler to be his assistant!'
Phoebe	 Ohh that\xc2\x92s so sweet! (Her cell phone rings.) Oh! Hang on! (Quickly\ngrabs a cigarette and starts to light it as her phone rings.) Hang onnnnnn!!! (Gets the\ncigarette lighted and answers the phone.) (On phone.) Go!! No! No-no! I said sell when it\nhits 50! 5-0, it\xc2\x92s a number! It comes after 4-9!! No, it\xc2\x92s okay. It\xc2\x92s okay,\nyou\xc2\x92re allowed one mistake. Just kidding, you are of course fired.'
Ross	 Hey Mon! '
Monica	 Hey!'
Ross	 Mon, look who I ran into! (Gestures towards Rachel.)'
Monica	 (gets up and gasps) Oh my God! Rachel!! (Rachel is stunned to see that\nher long lost friend is still fat.) (Monica goes over and gives Rachel a big bear hug,\nwhich is quite easy for her.) You look terrific!'
Rachel	 Ohh, so do you! Did you lose weight? (She\xc2\x92s not quite sure of that\none.)'
Monica	 You are so sweet to notice! Yes, I lost three and a half pounds!'
Ross	 And, and uh, you-you remember my friend Chandler. (Points to him.)'
Chandler	 Hey.'
Rachel	 Oh yeah.'
Ross	 And that\xc2\x92s Phoebe over there! (Points to her.)'
Phoebe	 Hi!'
Monica	 Oh my God, sit down! Sit down! How long as it been since we\xc2\x92ve seen\neach other?'
Ross	 (answering it) 1987, the day after Christmas, at Sean McMahon\xc2\x92s\nparty. I played you one of my songs, y\xc2\x92know Interplanetary Courtship Ritual.'
Rachel	 Oh yeah. Right. So now, are\xc2\x97do you, do you still do music?'
Ross	 Sometimes, you should come over (Joey returns from the bathroom) sometime!\nI\xc2\x92ll play you one of my other\xc2\x85'
Rachel	 (interrupting him and seeing Joey) Oh my God! Joey Tribbiani from Days\nof Our Lives, just walked in here!'
Monica	 Rach, he\xc2\x92s a friend of ours.'
Rachel	 (stunned) You are friends with Dr. Drake Remoray?'
Chandler	 Well it\xc2\x92s kinda hard to be friends with Drake because of his busy\nschedule and the fact that he\xc2\x92s not real.'
Ross	 (To Rachel) Hey-hey, or I could bring my keyboard over here\nsometime!'
Rachel	 He\xc2\x92s coming over! He\xc2\x92s coming over!'
Monica	 (getting up) Joey!'
Joey	 (holding a plate of what looks like Rice Crispies Treats) I know,\nhere-here!! (Hands her the plate.)'
Monica	 Ohhh! (Takes the plate.) No! This is my friend Rachel, we went to High\nSchool together.'
Rachel	 (giggles and can\xc2\x92t look at him) Hi!'
Joey	 (shaking Rachel\xc2\x92s hand) Hi!'
Rachel	 (still not quite able to look at him) Hi! I love you on that show! I\nwatch you everyday! I mean, when you took out your own kidney to save your ex-wife even\nthough she tired to kill you\xc2\x85'
Joey	 Well, it\xc2\x92s always nice to meet the fans.'
Rachel	 Ah!'
Joey	 (turning and whispering to Monica) She\xc2\x92s not crazy is she?'
Monica	 No.'
Joey	 (To Rachel) So uh, how you doin\xc2\x92?'

Chandler	 (reading the list) Drop off my dry cleaning. Pick up my vitamins.\nTeach me how to spell vitamins. Wear in my new jeans.'
Monica	 (laughs) You realize what you are don\xc2\x92t you?'
Chandler	 What?'
Monica	 You\xc2\x92re his bitch.'

Monica	 Yes!!'
Phoebe	 Then yes that is what I\xc2\x92m having. (Takes another puff of the\ncigarette.)'
Monica	 Oh my God!'

Ross	 Come on Pheebs, it\xc2\x92s not that bad! Y\xc2\x92know most people would be\nexcited if they didn\xc2\x92t have to work for a couple of weeks.'
Phoebe	 Most people don\xc2\x92t like their jobs, I love my job! I have not\nbeen working for three hours and I\xc2\x92m already going crazy. I miss Joan.'
Monica	 Honey, having a heart attack is nature\xc2\x92s way of telling you to slow\nit down.'
Chandler	 I always thought having a heart attack was nature\xc2\x92s way of\ntelling you to die! (Phoebe glares at him.) But you\xc2\x92re not gonna die. I mean, you are\ngoing to die, but you\xc2\x92re not gonna die today. I wish I was dead.'
Monica	 Let\xc2\x92s take a walk. (They start to leave.) Y\xc2\x92know maybe you\nshould consider writing for Talking Out of Your Ass magazine! (They exit.)'

Phoebe	 That is.'
Ross	 \xc2\x85since I stopped trying.'
Phoebe	 Maybe you need to spice things up a little.'
Ross	 What-what do you mean?'

Monica	 Sorry. So how\xc2\x92s it going with Joey?'
Chandler	 Oh just great. He beeps me now with codes. One is, "Bring me\nfood." Two is, "I\xc2\x92m with a girl, bring us food." Three is,\n"I\xc2\x92m lost and I can\xc2\x92t find food."'
Joey	 (entering) Hey! Is uh, is she gonna be all right?'

Rachel	 (awestruck, then not) Isn\xc2\x92t that a line from the show?!'
Joey	 Uh, yeah but uh, (In Drake\xc2\x92s voice) I may have said those things\nbefore but, I never truly meant them. Until now.'
Rachel	 That\xc2\x92s a line from the show too!'

Joey	 Thanks! (Looks at it.) Yeah, there\xc2\x92s pulp in that. (Hands it back.)'
Chandler	 Yeah?'
Joey	 I thought we talked about this. I don\xc2\x92t like pulp. No pulp. Pulp\nisn\xc2\x92t juice. All juice, okay?'
Chandler	 I\xc2\x92m sorry, I guess I just like the pulp.'
Joey	 Oh my God, I\xc2\x92m sorry, I\xc2\x92m being so rude. (Turns to Rachel.)\nRachel, would like a soda or something? Because Chandler would run right out and get it.'

Carol	 Like what?'
Ross	 Well I don\xc2\x92t know umm, (Pause) what if we were too tie each other up?\n(Carol\xc2\x92s shocked and obviously doesn\xc2\x92t like that idea.) Umm, some people eat\nstuff off one another. (Carol doesn\xc2\x92t like that idea either.) Nah! Umm, y\xc2\x92know\nwe-we could try dirty talk? (Carol still says no.) Umm, we could, we could have a\nthreesome.'
Carol	 (quickly) I love that idea!'

Chandler	 Oh you wouldn\xc2\x92t uh, care. It\xc2\x92s just a stupid comic book\nstory.'
Joey	 Are you kidding me?! I love Archie! And the whole gang!'
Chandler	 Well uh, Archie needs money to fix his jalopy (Joey laughs), uh but he\ndoesn\xc2\x92t want Reggie to just give him the money. So Reggie hires him as his\nassist\xc2\x97as his butler. And then makes him do all these crazy things like bring him\nmilkshakes that can\xc2\x92t have lumps in them.'
Joey	 Wait a minute. That sounds a little familiar! Did they already do that\none? \xc2\x91Cause I think I read it!'

Ross	 Yeah. Right. Save it. I can do that. (Gets up and does a little kara-tay.)'
Ross	 Hey, Pheebs!'
Phoebe	 Hey.'
Ross	 Hey, how\xc2\x92s it going?'
Phoebe	 Well, I\xc2\x92ve got to get out of this bed, I\xc2\x92m going crazy here.\nCrazy!'
Monica	 (handing her a cup) Here you go sweetie.'
Phoebe	 What the hell is this, herbal tea? I hate herbal tea!'
Monica	 But, I put some honey in it.'
Ross	 She doesn\xc2\x92t know she was fired yet, does she?'
Chandler	 No, the doctors say it may kill her.'
Phoebe	 What are you two girls whispering about over there?!'
Chandler	 (To Ross) But I think we should tell her.'
Ross	 Hey Pheebs, maybe this whole heart attack thing is a sign, that-that you\nshould start think about getting a different job.'
Phoebe	 Okay, what is this? A stupid contest? Because we got a winner here!\n(Points at Ross.)'
Chandler	 Listen Phoebe, he\xc2\x92s right. People are not supposed to have heart\nattacks at 31.'
Phoebe	 I know! But if I didn\xc2\x92t work there, what else would I do?'
Monica	 Well, you used to like playing the guitar.'
Phoebe	 Yeah that was lucrative! Smart like your brother!'
Chandler	 Uh, what about y\xc2\x92know the massage thing? That never gave you a\nheart attack.'
Phoebe	 Hmm, pulling in a salary in the high six figures or rubbing gross naked\npeople for chump change\xc2\x97ooh, what do I do?! What will I do?!'
Rachel	 Ohh, I mean it\xc2\x92s just so realistic!'
Joey	 I know. (Joey is sitting in this tall chair that is made up of balls on\npolls. You\xc2\x92ll have to see it to know what I mean.) Yeah, his name is Pat.'
Rachel	 Pat the dog. Oh! Oh! I get it!! (Laughs and finishes her drink.)'
Joey	 (climbing down from his chair) Do you uh, do you\xc2\x97ready for a refill?'
Rachel	 Oh, I probably shouldn\xc2\x92t\xc2\x97so I will! (Joey starts making her\nrefill and Rachel notices that rain thing Joey has.) Oh! Wow! It\xc2\x92s like it\xc2\x92s\nraining!'
Joey	 Pretty cool, huh? But if you\xc2\x92re thinking you can put a fish in there\nand it wouldn\xc2\x92t get sucked up into the mechanism, well you\xc2\x92d be wrong.'
Rachel	 Umm, can I use your bathroom?'
Joey	 It\xc2\x92s uh, right through there. (Points.)'
Rachel	 Okay. (Starts to go.) God y\xc2\x92know, if someone told me a week ago\nthat I would be peeing in Joey Tribbiani\xc2\x92s apartment\xc2\x85'
Joey	 Yeah, life\xc2\x92s pretty great isn\xc2\x92t it?'
Rachel	 Yeah, it sure is!'
Monica	 I hope you\xc2\x92re hungry, we\xc2\x92re starting with oysters. And\ny\xc2\x92know what they say about oysters, don\xc2\x92t you?'
Dr. Roger	 They have parasites?'
Monica	 No! Umm well, some people say that Oysters are an aphrodisiac. '
Dr. Roger	 What people?'
Monica	 People! People say it! Come here! (She grabs him and kisses him.)'
Dr. Roger	 So oysters, huh?'
Monica	 And then we\xc2\x92re gonna have a little Middle Eastern cous-cous.\nSomething we can eat, with our hands.'
Dr. Roger	 Y\xc2\x92know, it\xc2\x92s funny, but when we were studying communicable\ndiseases\xc2\x85'
Monica	 No-no-no, no! It\xc2\x92s sensual!'
Dr. Roger	 Ohh! Didn\xc2\x92t know! Okay! '
Monica	 Okay! (They kiss again and his beeper goes off.) Ohhh no!'
Dr. Roger	 I\xc2\x92m sorry sweetie, it\xc2\x92s the hospital. The food looks great,\nmaybe save me some?'
Monica	 I can\xc2\x92t promise anything. (She starts to dig in.)'
Ross	 We\xc2\x92re really gonna do this, huh?'
Carol	 Looks like it.'
Ross	 Y\xc2\x92know, if, if this is too weird for you, we can still back out\nat\xc2\x85 (A knock on the door interrupts him.)'
Carol	 (jumping up to get it) I got it!'
Ross	 Okay.'
Carol	 (opening the door) Susan! Hi! (Who\xc2\x92d you think it was gonna be?)'
Susan	 Hey! (They hug.)'
Carol	 Thank you so much for coming.'
Susan	 Oh, I wouldn\xc2\x92t miss it for the world.'
Ross	 I\xc2\x92m-I\xc2\x92m Ross by the way.'
Susan	 (not taking her eyes off Carol) Hello Ross. (Takes off her coat and hands\nit to him.) I love what you\xc2\x92ve done with this space.'
Carol	 Thank you so much.'
Ross	 How hot is this?!'
Chandler	 I\xc2\x92m sorry you\xc2\x92re here with me instead of Roger.'
Monica	 Yeah, me too.'
Chandler	 Well, I could make it seem like he\xc2\x92s here. (Imitates him.)\n"Here\xc2\x92s some little known facts about cous-cous. They didn\xc2\x92t add the second\ncous until 1979." (Mumbles something further.)'
Monica	 Stop it!! That\xc2\x92s not funny!!'
Chandler	 Okay.'
Monica	 I\xc2\x92m sorry, okay? It just\xc2\x97tonight was supposed to be\ny\xc2\x92know, it was supposed to be a big deal.'
Chandler	 What was tonight?'
Monica	 You don\xc2\x92t want to know what tonight was.'
Chandler	 Okay. (Pause.) What was tonight?'
Monica	 Well, tonight was\xc2\x97was going to be my first time.'
Chandler	 With Roger? (Monica shyly looks away.) Not just with Roger?! (Monica\nshrugs.) Oh my God!'
Monica	 All right relax Mr. I\xc2\x92ve Had Sex Four Times!'
Chandler	 Four different women! I\xc2\x92ve had sex way more times!'
Monica	 How many?'
Chandler	 Nine.'
Monica	 I was just waiting for the perfect guy.'
Chandler	 Well good, good for you. You really think that Roger is the perfect\nguy?'
Monica	 No. He\xc2\x92s not a horrible guy.'
Chandler	 Hey that\xc2\x92s what I tell girls about me.'
Monica	 Chandler, I\xc2\x92m gonna die a virgin!'
Chandler	 No you are not! You are sweet and wonderful and this is gonna happen\nfor you.'
Monica	 Oh really? When? Do you wanna do it with me?'
Chandler	 Okay. (They both realize what he just said.)'
Monica	 I was kidding.'
Chandler	 So was I.'
Rachel	 Joey, you\xc2\x92re such an amazing actor! (He smiles.) How do you know\nwhere Dr. Drake Remoray leaves off and Joey Tribbiani begins?'
Joey	 Well, with Dr. Drake they always tell me what to say. And with Joey, I\npretty much have to make it up on my own.'
Rachel	 Wow! Tell me something Joey\xc2\x97(She falls off the couch)\xc2\x97Whoa! I\njust fell right off the couch there.'
Joey	 Yeah you did.'
Rachel	 Okay. (She climbs back onto the couch.) '
Joey	 Here you go. Let me ask you a question.'
Rachel	 Yeah?'
Joey	 When was the last time someone told you just how beautiful you are?'
Rachel	 Wow! I can\xc2\x92t, I can\xc2\x92t feel my hands.'
Joey	 Come, come here. '
Chandler	 We can\xc2\x92t do this.'
Monica	 No! (They both laugh.) Oyster?'
Chandler	 Yeah! (Takes it.) If-if-if we did do this there would be a lot of\npressure on me, y\xc2\x92know? Because you\xc2\x92ve been waiting a very long time and I\nwouldn\xc2\x92t want to disappoint you.'
Monica	 Yeah but see I have nothing to compare it too. So even if you\xc2\x92re\nhorrible, how would I know?'
Chandler	 I do like that.'
Monica	 It\xc2\x92s harder for me! I have those four other women to compete with!'
Chandler	 Well, if it helps there were only three. So it would just be for\ntonight, right?'
Monica	 Absolutely! It would just be one friend (Points at Chandler) helping out\nanother friend. (Points at herself.)'
Chandler	 Stop it! We\xc2\x92re doing this! Let\xc2\x92s do it!'
Monica	 Noo!! Okay!!'
Chandler	 Okay! (They both get up.)'
Monica	 Umm, do you have any uhh, moves?'
Chandler	 I have some moves.'
Monica	 I have no moves. (He moves in to kiss her and she laughs and backs\naway.) Okay, whatcha doin\xc2\x92 there?! (Giggles.) Oh y\xc2\x92know what? I\xc2\x92m sorry,\nthis is just too weird.'
Chandler	 Yeah, let\xc2\x92s just forget it.'
Monica	 What if I turn out the lights? (Runs to shut them off.)'
Chandler	 Okay!'
Chandler	 Oh yeah.'
Monica	 Chandler?'
Chandler	 (sexily) Yeah?'
Monica	 That\xc2\x92s the couch.'

Chandler	 Oh my God!'
Monica	 I know! I\xc2\x92ll tell you something, we are gonna do that again!'
Chandler	 Oh, okay! (He rolls over to do that again.)'
Joey	 (entering) Morning!'
Rachel	 (wakes up suddenly and realizes where she is) Oh right.'
Joey	 Yeah.'
Rachel	 (groans) Oh God. Oh I can\xc2\x92t believe Joey Tribbiani heard me throw\nup!'
Joey	 Well he actually saw you a little bit too.'
Rachel	 Noo! Oh God we did\xc2\x97we didn\xc2\x92t, we didn\xc2\x92t uhh\xc2\x85'
Joey	 No! No! No, not after seeing that.'
Rachel	 God I\xc2\x92m just a horrible person.'
Joey	 Wh-why?'
Rachel	 Because I\xc2\x92m married. That\xc2\x92s right, I am a married woman! And I\ncame to a TV star\xc2\x92s apartment to have an affair! Uck!'
Joey	 That\xc2\x92s ridiculous! I\xc2\x92m not a "Star," just a regular\nfamous actor.'
Rachel	 Yeah and I\xc2\x92m a horrible, horrible person.'
Joey	 Rachel, would you stop saying that?! Hey-hey look, remember on the show\nwhen-when Caprice was dying and she gave me\xc2\x85'
Rachel	 The ring from the cave, yeah.'
Joey	 Wow! Uh okay, well uh\xc2\x85 (He gets up, opens a drawer, and pulls out the\nring.)'
Rachel	 (seeing the ring and gasping) Oh my God, they let you keep that stuff?!'
Joey	 Sure! As long as they don\xc2\x92t find out you can keep whatever you want!\nAnd I want you to have it.'
Rachel	 No! No-no-no\xc2\x85'
Joey	 Yes! Yes!! And every time you look at it, I want you to remember that you\nare a good person. Okay, you\xc2\x92ve had the chance to cheat, and with me, but you\ndidn\xc2\x92t. And that\xc2\x92s what this ring stands for.'
Rachel	 But I thought that ring stood for Caprice\xc2\x92s undying love for her\nbrother.'
Joey	 Look, do you want the ring or not?!'
Rachel	 Yeah!'
Ross	 Hey!'
Joey	 Hey!'
Ross	 Look at you! You\xc2\x92re up!'
Joey	 All right!'
Phoebe	 I thought I\xc2\x92d try to take a walk. Would you pour me some water?\nI\xc2\x92ll be back soon.'
Joey	 Whoa-whoa-whoa! You\xc2\x92re not gonna use the pay phone to call work, are\nya?'
Phoebe	 No. I\xc2\x92ve learned my lesson.'
Phoebe	 Let\xc2\x92s go! Come on! Move it! (Grabs her coat.) Come on! (To an old\nman who\xc2\x92s holding her shoes and briefcase.) Shoes! Briefcase! (Takes them both.)\nThanks Lou, good luck with the gall bladder. (She leaves.)'
Ross	 Hey Joe did\xc2\x85 Did you ever have a threesome?'
Joey	 (not quite sure of how to answer that) Well uh, look Ross I uh, I think\nCarol\xc2\x92s great and I\xc2\x92m sure you\xc2\x92re a very attractive man, but I\xc2\x85.'

Joey	 You?'
Ross	 Yeah!'
Joey	 Wow!'
Ross	 Yeah!'
Joey	 All right! So, was it amazing?'
Ross	 It was, it was okay.'
Joey	 Just okay\xc2\x97Did you do it right?!'
Ross	 Look, it\xc2\x92s just did, did you ever go to a party and think,\n"Would really anyone miss me if I weren\xc2\x92t here?"'
Joey	 Huh. But still Ross, you\xc2\x92re worst day with two women, pretty much\nbetter than any other day! Y\xc2\x92know what I mean?'
Ross	 Oh-oh, absolutely!'
Ross	 It\xc2\x92s just, my part seemed to be over pretty quickly and then, and\nthen there was a lot of waiting around.'
Joey	 But you got to be with both of them, right?'
Ross	 Not-not really. Th-th-there was just Carol.'
Joey	 Not the other one?'
Ross	 No, she kept kicking me away!'
Joey	 Yeah, you don\xc2\x92t want that.'
Ross	 No!'
Joey	 Well hey, at least you got to see a lot of stuff, right?'
Ross	 Oh I a lot of stuff!'

Chandler	 Oh. Oh right! Right! Because you\xc2\x92re still seeing him and uh,\nhe\xc2\x92s a good guy. I mean, I remember a time when\xc2\x85 (He fakes falling asleep.)'
Monica	 Are you okay?'
Chandler	 Yeah! Totally! Totally, and you?'
Monica	 Great! It\xc2\x92s so amazing! I mean, last time Dr. Roger came over, I\nwas so nervous, but then after being with you I\xc2\x92m all like, "Can the\ndoctor see me now?"'
Chandler	 I bet he can.'
Monica	 Y\xc2\x92know, I don\xc2\x92t have an appointment, but I sure could use a\nphysical. (He laughs halfheartedly) Are you sure you\xc2\x92re okay?'
Chandler	 Oh yeah! Yeah! Don\xc2\x92t worry about me, I\xc2\x92ll be fine! (Does a\nkara-tay move.)'

Ross	 Yeah.'
Rachel	 Sit down! '

Ross	 Didn\xc2\x92t you spend last night at Joey\xc2\x92s?'
Rachel	 Aw what are you?! A detective?'
Ross	 Look I-I don\xc2\x92t know what\xc2\x92s going on with you and your husband\nand what is hopefully an adult dog walker, look can I just say not all men are like that.'
Rachel	 Oh. (Doesn\xc2\x92t believe it.)'
Ross	 Hey! There are some men who will do whatever it takes to make their\nmarriage work! Okay? There are some men who will stand by and-and watch as their wives\nengage in-in what only can be described as a twosome with some-some woman she\nbarely knows from the gym!'
Rachel	 Who are these men?'
Ross	 Men. I guy I know.'
Rachel	 Well, you might want to tell him it sounds like his wife is (whispers)\ngay.'
Ross	 She is not\xc2\x85 (Realizes) She\xc2\x92s gay. Oh my God. She is so\ngay! I can\xc2\x92t believe this.'
Rachel	 Good day for married people huh?'
Ross	 I\xc2\x92m sorry your husband cheated on you.'
Rachel	 I\xc2\x92m sorry your wife is gay. I guess women aren\xc2\x92t that great\neither.'
Ross	 Try telling my wife that.'
Chandler	 (sticking his head in the door) Okay to come in?'
Monica	 Yeah, come on, eat, whatever you want. Dr. Roger got beeped again.'
Chandler	 Yeah I know, guess who beeped him?'
Monica	 What?!'
Chandler	 I\xc2\x92m the ruptured spleen. (Laughs.) '
Monica	 Why would you do that?'
Chandler	 Because you shouldn\xc2\x92t be with him. (Pause.) You should be with\nme.'
Monica	 Really?'
Chandler	 Yeah! When you were talking about Roger, that was killing me! Look,\nthings like last night they don\xc2\x92t just happen. Y\xc2\x92know? Or at least not to me. Or\nwith the other two women, in the morning y\xc2\x92know I was just lying there and I\ncouldn\xc2\x92t wait to just go hang out with my friends, but with you I always y\xc2\x92know\nwith a friend.'
Monica	 Chandler!'
Chandler	 I know you probably don\xc2\x92t want to go out with me, y\xc2\x92know\nbecause I make too many jokes and I\xc2\x92ve never been in a serious relationship and I\nguess I\xc2\x92m not technically a "doctor\xc2\x85"'
Monica	 There was just one woman, wasn\xc2\x92t there?'
Chandler	 No, there were two.'
Monica	 Including me?'
Chandler	 Oh yeah.'

Phoebe	 (singing)'
