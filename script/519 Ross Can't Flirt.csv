Ross	 Hey!'
Chandler	 Hey!'
Ross	 Wow! You look nice. What's the occasion?"
Chandler	 Monica and I are celebrating our ten-month anniversary, we've got\nreservations at Ja George."
Ross	 Wow! How'd you get in there?"
Chandler	 Made a few calls, pulled some strings, and they agreed to seat us at\n11
Chandler	 Hey Caitlin! Somebody got a haircut.'
Caitlin	 Ugh, I hate it! I look like an 8-year-old boy.'
Chandler	 Yeah, if that was true, gym class would've been a lot more\ninteresting."
Caitlin	 It's uh, 27 dollars even."
Chandler	 Oh, okay. (Hands her the money.) Here you go. '
Caitlin	 Hey, where's the chicken?"
Chandler	 Oh, he's in the back. The duck pissed him off, said that eggs came\nfirst."
Caitlin	 (laughs) Great. I'll see you later!"
Chandler	 Okay, bye!'
Ross	 What the hell was that?!'
Chandler	 What?'
Ross	 The flirting! Aren't you supposed to be going out with, I don't know hmm,\nlet's say my sister?!"
Chandler	 I was not flirting.'
Ross	 It was totally flirting. "Somebody got a haircut (Makes some whiney,\nnasally noises.)"'
Chandler	 Okay first of all, the impression, uncanny. And second, that was not\nflirting, that was just casual conversation between two people. That is all.'
Ross	 Yeah, right.'
Chandler	 You wanna see flirting? I'll show you flirting. (Starts to move\ntowards Ross.)"
Ross	 (backing away) I'm good."

Rachel	 I am so proud of Joey, I can't believe he's going to be on Law &\nOrder!"
Phoebe	 I know. But don't you think that it should be called Order and Law?"
Rachel	 No because first they arrest the guy and then they try him.'
Phoebe	 Don't get me started on that."
Chandler	 I was not flirting.'
Ross	 And on your anniversary, for shame!'
Rachel	 What's going on?"
Ross	 Chandler was hitting on the hot delivery girl!'
Chandler	 I was not and oh God, shh!'
Ross	 Well I'm sorry but you were! Okay? And besides if anyone should be hitting\non her it's the guy who's single, the guy that who-who-who can do something about it."
Phoebe	 Sounds like somebody wants to be Mr. Pizza Delivery Girl.'
Ross	 Well\xc2\x85'
Chandler	 Is that what this is about? You like Caitlin?'
Rachel	 Ross! We broke up two years ago; you've been married since then.\nI think it's okay that we see other people."
Ross	 Well, I-I was watching her the other day at the pizza place.'
Rachel	 Hm-mmm.'
Ross	 And she's just so sexy and funny and has the cutest little\xc2\x85"
Rachel	 Okay, y'know what? We don't need her measurements. "
Phoebe	 (looking through the pizzas) Okay pepperoni, pepperoni, pepperoni, okay\nRoss, I know she's pretty and you love her, but is she stupid?! She forgot my vegetarian!"
Ross	 This is perfect! She'll have to come back here with your pizza, and when\nshe does, I'll turn on the Charm-O-Ross. Oh I'm so glad you don't eat meat."
Phoebe	 See? Vegetarianism benefits everyone.'
Joey	 (entering, with his grandmother) Hey everybody, look who's here! You\nremember my grandmother!"
Rachel	 Big night!'
Phoebe	 This is so cool!'
Chandler	 So, Joey on Law & Order, you must be very proud!'
Joey	 Chandler, she doesn't understand a word of English."
Chandler	 I'm sorry, I thought you were Joey's other grandmother. (She just\nstares at him.) I've done it again."
Joey	 She's my biggest fan. Yeah, she's the only one in the family that's\nbelieved in me. "
Joey	 Yeah, I uh weighted like 27 pounds when I was born so\xc2\x85'
Monica	 (entering from the bathroom) Hey! Happy Anniversary!'
Chandler	 Happy Anniversary, 10 months! (They kiss.)'
Monica	 So umm, when I was in the shower I was thinking about our first night in\nLondon\xc2\x85'
Chandler	 Uhh, Joey's grandmother is right there. (Points)"
Monica	 Is that the one that speaks English or the one that doesn't?"
Chandler	 The one that doesn't."
Monica	 That was some hot love you gave me! I'm gonna go get ready."
Chandler	 Hey, why don't you wear those earrings I gave you?"
Monica	 That's a great idea! I was saving them for something special."
Chandler	 Okay.'
Monica	 (runs over to Phoebe) You have got to go home!'
Phoebe	 But I like it here!'
Monica	 You gotta go home and get the earrings that you borrowed from me okay?\nChandler wants me to wear them tonight.'
Phoebe	 Okay, well I think that they're in my purse. Why don't you go get\ndressed and I'll look for them."
Monica	 Great!'
Phoebe	 Okay! (Walks over to Rachel) Rach, hi, I need those earrings you\nborrowed.'
Rachel	 Oh, umm, okay, yeah, I'll be, yeah I'll be right back. (Goes to her\nroom.)"
Joey	 Wow Pheebs, you speak Italian?'
Phoebe	 I guess so. (See, the brief possession didn't affect her at all, like we\ncould really tell.)"
Rachel	 (She enters and hands Phoebe the earring) Here you go. Thank you!'
Phoebe	 Wait, Rach! Where's the other one?"
Rachel	 Oh what, you-you want both of them?'
Phoebe	 Rachel Karen Green, where's the other earring?!"
Rachel	 Okay, okay, okay, look, just don't freak out, but I kinda lost it. I\nknow it's in the apartment, but I definitely lost it."
Phoebe	 Well, what am I going to tell Monica? She wants to wear them tonight!'
Rachel	 Tell her to wear her own earrings.'
Phoebe	 These are her earrings.'
Rachel	 Nooo! Nooooo! You lent me Monica's earrings?! I'm not allowed to borrow\nher stuff!"
Phoebe	 Why not?'
Rachel	 Because I lose her stuff!'
Joey	 Okay, see that blind guy right there? I'm gonna bash his head in later."
Joey	 Oh umm, my big scene is coming up. Big scene coming up.'
Chandler	 If you said, "Big lima bean, bubbling up." Would she\nunderstand the difference?'
Monica	 (noticing Rachel crawling behind the couch) Rach? What are you doing?'
Rachel	 Oh boy, I just can't watch. It's too scary!"
Monica	 It's a diaper commercial."
Rachel	 Oh yeah well, you know me, babies, responsibilities, ahhh!!!'
Caitlin	 Pizza delivery!'
Ross	 I'll get it! I will get that! (Runs over and opens the door.)"
Caitlin	 Hi!'
Ross	 Hi!'
Caitlin	 One uh, vegetarian pizza. That's $12.15."
Ross	 Oh. Uh, by the way, if it makes you feel any better. I happen to like\n8-year-old boys.'
Caitlin	 What?!'
Ross	 (I can't make it out.) The uh, your hair, before, your hair, you said you\nthought your looks like an 8-year-old's, and I'm just saying I like it. The hair."
Caitlin	 Oh. Thanks.'
Ross	 You understand I don't actually like 8-year-old boys."
Caitlin	 Y'know, all I'm looking for is the money."
Chandler	 Here you go. (Hands her the money.) Now stop bringing us pizzas you.'
Caitlin	 I'm gonna try. (Walks away and Ross closes the door.)"
Chandler	 You're welcome."
Ross	 You couldn't let me have her, could ya?!"
Chandler	 What?'
Ross	 This is a girl that I really like and had too swoop in there!'
Monica	 What's goin' on?"
Ross	 Chandler was totally flirting with the hot delivery girl!'
Chandler	 Thank you for that! (To Monica) I was not flirting.'
Monica	 It's okay. I don't care. It's uh, it's fine."
Ross	 Really?!'
Chandler	 Really?!'
Monica	 It's no big deal, I do it all the time."
Chandler	 (starts to laugh, but then gets serious) So umm, you-you flirt with\nguys all the time?'
Monica	 Sure! It doesn't mean anything! Just like I know it doesn't mean\nanything with you!"
Chandler	 Okay, but there is a big difference. You are a lot hotter than\nI am.'
Joey	 (walking past) True story! (Goes and sits down.)'
Monica	 Chandler, this actually bothers you?'
Chandler	 Yes, it does bother me! And I think it would bother a lot of people.\nRachel, when you were going out with Ross, did it bother you when he flirted with other\nwomen?'
Rachel	 Uhh, no, no, it bothered me when he slept with other women.'
Ross	 And thank you, for that.'
Rachel	 But y'know, I never really had anything to worry about. Ross was never\nvery good at the flirting thing."
Ross	 What? (Mumbles) What-what, what are talking about? It-it worked with you.'
Rachel	 Oh! Y'know what? You're right! We meet, you flirted and then bamn\nnine years later you had me!"
Ross	 All right, all right. You-you-you know what I'm going to do? I am going to\norder another pizza and when Caitlin gets here, you-you--I will show how well I flirt.\nYeah! I will, I will get her phone number! (To Chandler) And not the one on the menu!"
Phoebe	 (entering from Rachel's bedroom) I found it!"
Rachel	 Ohh! Thank God! Where was it?'
Phoebe	 On your dresser.'
Rachel	 Okay that is the one we already have!'
Joey	 Okay, here's my big scene. My big scene's here! (They have two of the cops\non the street, then they cut to where they're entering an apartment.) Oh my God."
Monica	 What?'
Joey	 (smiling) Okay, everybody just keep smiling. It'll kill my grandmother if\nshe finds out."
Chandler	 (smiling) Well, what is it?'
Joey	 (smiling) Oh, they cut me out of the show.'
Rachel	 (smiling) What?!'
Ross	 (smiling) Are you sure?'
Phoebe	 (smiling) Maybe your scene's coming up?"
Joey	 (smiling) Not likely.\xc2\xa0 'Cause you see that body bag right there"
Rachel	 (smiling) Yeah.'
Joey	 (smiling) I'm in it."

Phoebe	 (smiling) This is terrible, what are you going to do?'
Joey	 (smiling) I don't know. This little, old lady lives for my career. When\nthey dumped me off of Days of Our Lives she almost died."
Phoebe	 (not smiling) That's not good."
Joey	 (smiling) No, smile! Not that face, smile! Everybody smile! (They all\nsmile.)'
Rachel	 (smiling) Joey, why don't you just tell her what happened? It's not your\nfault."
Chandler	 (smiling) If we keep talking this way, aren't we gonna freak her out\nsoon?"
Grandma Tribbiani	 (Something in Italian to Joey.)'
Joey	 Soon, soon, I'm gonna be on soon. There I am! (Points to the screen, of\ncourse it isn't him.)"
Grandma Tribbiani	 (pointing at the screen) No! Sam Waterston!'
Joey	 No-no-no, that-that's me, that's me."
Grandma Tribbiani	 No, it's Sam Waterston! Crimes and Misdemeanors,\nCapricorn One."
Chandler	 Doesn\'t know, "Hello." But she knows Capricorn One.'
Monica	 (following her) Phoebe! I have to have those earrings, we're going to\nleave as soon as the show is over."
Phoebe	 But I already gave them back to you!'
Monica	 No you didn't."
Phoebe	 All right, I already didn't give them back to you, that's what I said.\n(Walks away over to Rachel.) Where is that other earring?"
Rachel	 It's not here Pheebs, it's not here. Ohh, I went to Joey and Chandler's\nlast night! Okay! (Goes to the door.)"
Phoebe	 Make sure you check Chandler's jewelry box."
Rachel	 Wait a minute. Chandler has a jewelry box?'
Phoebe	 Okay, we have like ten minutes. Do you want me to get into that now?!'
Ross	 (To Phoebe) Hey Pheebs! How's that uh, vegetarian pizza working out for\nya? You and those vegetables have a real thing going on, huh?"
Phoebe	 (she just looks at him) Why are you being weird?'
Ross	 Do you like it?'
Phoebe	 No, that would be, "Why are you being cute?"'
Ross	 Okay, I'm working on my flirting."
Phoebe	 Ohh! I did not get that.'
Chandler	 So uh Monica, do you, do you like the Law & Order?'
Monica	 Yeah, it's good."
Chandler	 See, I'm finding out all this stuff about you today, like you like the\nLaw & Order and that you flirted with every guy in the Tri-State area!"
Monica	 Chandler! (Joey and his grandmother shush them and wave them away, which\nthey do.) Okay, let me get this straight, it's okay for you to flirt, but not for me."
Chandler	 Oh, I'm so glad we cleared that up. Look, I'm sorry, some things are\ndifferent for men and for women."
Monica	 Go on, teach me something about men and women.'
Chandler	 Okay, I\'ve already taught you so much already, but whatever. See when\nyou flirt with a guy you think, "I\'m just flirting, no big deal." But the guy is\nthinking, "Finally! Somebody who wants to sleep with me!"'
Monica	 No way!'
Chandler	 It's true."
Monica	 Well that's pathetic!"
Chandler	 Again true.'
Monica	 And this goes for all guys?'
Chandler	 All guys that are awake. Then we go to sleep and then all the guys\nfrom the other end of the world wake up and behave the exact same way.'
Joey	 (To Ross in the kitchen) All right, it's another commercial; I still\nhaven't told her!"
Ross	 Joey! This is like the last commercial. You've got like (checks his watch)\nten minutes left!"
Joey	 I know, I know! What am I going to do? (Thinks) Ooh!'
Monica	 No! You are not gonna run out and leave her here!'
Joey	 (dejected) Yeah, all right. (Thinks of something.) Ooh! (He quickly runs\nout before anyone can stop him.)'
Grandma Tribbiani	 Joey!'
Chandler	 Uh, Joey is gonna be right back. Right back! (Tries to pantomime it\nfor her.) Meanwhile, let's-let's-let's talk about you. (Pause.) So, you're old and small."
Rachel	 (entering) (To Phoebe) (whispering) Hey!'
Phoebe	 Did you find it?'
Rachel	 The earring? No. But look, I found my sunglasses under the couch! I've\nbeen looking for these since like last summer. (Puts 'em on.)"
Phoebe	 Okay, those are my sunglasses, you borrowed them from me.'
Rachel	 Okay, calm down, here they are. (Gives back the sunglasses.)'
Monica	 (entering from her room) Phoebe! (Motions for the earrings. Phoebe gives\nher the one-minute sign.)'
Phoebe	 (To Rachel) What are we going to do?!'
Rachel	 I don't know, I don't know."
Phoebe	 All right well, we're just gonna have to tell Monica, that's all."
Rachel	 Oh gosh, she's going to kill me."
Phoebe	 I suppose I could tell her it's just all my fault."
Rachel	 Ohh that'd be great!"
Phoebe	 Mon, can I talk to you for a sec?'
Monica	 Yeah, what is it?'
Phoebe	 Umm, I lost one of your earrings. I'm sorry! I am so, so sorry!"
Monica	 (shocked) Wow! All right well, I mean, what can you do? If you lost it\nyou lost it.'
Phoebe	 I will replace it, I promise. I feel so terrible.'
Monica	 All right, sweetie that's fine. You didn't do it on purpose."
Phoebe	 No. '
Monica	 Look at you! Come here! (They hug.) Feel better?'
Phoebe	 Yeah! You're the best!"
Rachel	 Okay, wait a minute. Wait a minute, I-I-I, I can't do this. Listen\nhoney, this is, it's not Phoebe's fault. She lent me the earrings, and I lost it.\nI'm so sorry. Honey, I feel terrible too. (Holds out her arms for a hug.)"
Monica	 (angrily) That is exactly why I do not lend you stuff!! (Rachel\nlooks over at Phoebe in resignation.) Okay?! I mean, first it's my jewelry! And if it's\nnot my jewelry, it's-it's my blue sweater! And if it's not my sweater, it's my sunglasses!"
Rachel	 Your sunglasses?!'
Monica	 Yes!'
Phoebe	 Oh, right! (Hands Monica back her sunglasses.)'
Caitlin	 (from outside) Pizza!'
Ross	 (running to the door) Oh, mine! Mine! Mine! (to everyone) Okay, here goes.\nPrepare yourselves for some Class A flirting.'
Chandler	 Okay, hold on. (Pauses as he readies himself.) Okay. (Walks away.)'
Rachel	 Honey, you have nothing to prove. And if you really like this girl, I\ndon't flirting is the right thing to\xc2\x85 (Ross interrupts and shushes her.)"
Ross	 You'll see. Okay. (Readies himself.) Oh, what's-what's her name?"
Grandma Tribbiani	 Caitlin!'
Ross	 (He opens the door while faking a laugh.) Hey! Oh, we-we can't keep eating\nlike this. (Monica turns her head in shame.)"
Caitlin	 It's uh, $12.50."
Ross	 Okay, (gets the money) so, do you make the pizzas in one of those uh,\nwood-burning ovens?'
Caitlin	 No actually umm, I think that they're umm, gas."
Ross	 Gas? Wow! Intense.'
Chandler	 (To Monica) If this is the way all the Gellers flirt, we don't have a\nproblem."
Ross	 (to Caitlin) Hey uh, y'know that smell gas has?"
Caitlin	 (wanting more than anything to get the money and leave this horrible,\nhorrible place) Yeah.'
Ross	 They put that in.'
Caitlin	 What?!'
Ross	 The gas is odorless, but they add the smell so you know when there's a\nleak."
Caitlin	 (getting more desperate to leave) Well okay!'
Ross	 A lot of other gas smells\xc2\x85'
Chandler	 Oh the humanity.'
Ross	 Meth-methane smells\xc2\x85'
Caitlin	 Y'know what umm, actually I, I really, I should go."
Ross	 Oh but I-I-I haven't paid you yet!"
Caitlin	 Y'know what? That's okay, you guys have ordered so many that this one\nis on me! (Runs for her life.)"
Ross	 (To All) Was I talking to her about gas?'
Chandler	 More so than anything else.'
Phoebe	 I-I-I found it interesting.'
Rachel	 I'm sorry."
Ross	 Look, no-no, hey, hey, don't worry about it! In nine years, she and I will\nbe right there. (Goes and sits on the couch dejectedly.)"
Rachel	 Okay, well, I'm gonna clear out some of these boxes. (She grabs a couple\nof the old pizza boxes and exits.)"
Phoebe	 (walking over to Ross) Ross?'
Ross	 Yeah?'
Phoebe	 What else do they add smell too?'
Rachel	 Hey! Hey! (Stops Caitlin) Hi! Hey-hey-hey, I'm Rachel! From upstairs?\nThe ones with all the pizza?"
Caitlin	 Oh, is there a problem?'
Rachel	 No. No. Every thing's--they're fine. Great pizza. But it's uh, actually\numm my friend Ross. He uh, just gets really nervous when he's flirting."
Caitlin	 Oh my God! That was flirting?!'
Rachel	 Yeah.'
Caitlin	 Wow!'
Rachel	 I know, I know, but uh just, I'm telling you, once, once you get past\nthat part, that where it-it just feels like you wanna die, he's-he's really a good person."
Caitlin	 The guy with the gas?!'
Rachel	 Yeah. I'm-I'm telling you he's really sweet and he's really funny and\nhe's just ugh, got a good heart. And besides, I y'know, I think he really likes you."
Caitlin	 Really?!'
Rachel	 Well y'know, we have 7 people and like 10 pizzas, what do you think?"
Caitlin	 I just, I thought Joey was there.'
Rachel	 (entering) Hey Ross? Umm, I just ran into Caitlin in the hallway and-and\nuh, you must be getting better at this flirting stuff than I thought.'
Ross	 What do you mean?'
Rachel	 Well, I don't get it, but she wanted me to give you her phone number.\n(Hands him the slip of paper with the phone number on it.)"
Ross	 And she just gave you this?'
Rachel	 Yeah!'
Ross	 Rach, thanks but uh, I don't need you doing me any favors."
Rachel	 I-I-I didn't! I didn't! She thought you were cute."
Ross	 Well that I can believe.'
Rachel	 Yay!'
Joey	 (entering) Hey! Is the show still on?'
Chandler	 Almost over man.'
Joey	 (says hi to his grandma) Look! Oh! (Pointing out the window.) Is that the\nPope?! (Chandler and his grandma turn to look and Joey slips a tape into the VCR.)'
Chandler	 Why am I looking?'
Joey	 Oh, here I am, here's my big scene!"
Joey	 (on the tape) All right back off! I gotta gun! I'm not afraid to use it!"
Grandma Tribbiani	 Oh Joey!'
Joey	 That's right!"
Chandler	 You couldn't have at least changed your shirt."
Joey	 (on the tape) Now, I wanna a suitcase filled with 100,000 dollars. (The\nduck quacks, to the duck) Choo! Choo! Choo! (To the imaginary cops) Filled with $100,000\nin small bills, and if I don't get it\xc2\x85(the duck quacks louder) Choo!! And if I don't\nget it, (pause, picks up the duck) I'm gonna shoot this duck!"
Phoebe	 Oh no!'
Joey	 (on the tape) I'm comin' out! (He opens the door and hops out pointing the\ngun in all directions and then runs out of view.)"
Ross	 (To Phoebe) And she's supposed to buy this?!"
Grandma Tribbiani	 Joey, bravo! (Starts with that Italian stuff again.)'
Chandler	 (singing) Ground control to Major Tom! Commencing\ncountdown\xc2\x85engines\xc2\x85on!'
Joey	 (to his grandmother) That's uh, scenes from next week's show. Next week's!"
Phoebe	 I am definitely gonna watch that!'

Monica	 What about these? These look the same?'
Phoebe	 Definitely!'
Monica	 Not as each other! '
Phoebe	 Oh, then no.'
Chandler	 (To Monica) Hey!'
Monica	 Hi!'
Chandler	 You ready?'
Monica	 Yeah.'
Chandler	 You look amazing. I'm the luckiest man in the world."
Monica	 Ohh, you're about to get a little luckier."
Chandler	 Let me see the earrings.'
Monica	 Oh, honey, the earrings\xc2\x85'
Chandler	 (looking at them) They look great! Does your boyfriend have the best\ntaste or what?'
Monica	 My boyfriend really does have good taste!'
Chandler	 (To Ross) Thanks for picking out the earrings man.'
Ross	 Hm-mmm.'
