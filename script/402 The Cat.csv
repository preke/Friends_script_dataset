Chandler	 Wow! That ripped! That ripped real nice!'
Joey	 How many times do I have to tell you! Ya, turn and sliiiide! Y'know, turn\nand slide."
Chandler	 You don\xc2\x92t turn and slide, you throw it out! I\xc2\x92m tired of\nhaving to get a tetanus shot every time I get dressed!'
Joey	 Look, we\xc2\x92re not throwing it out! I built this thing with my own\nhands!'
Chandler	 All right, how about we, how \xc2\x91bout we sell it.'
Joey	 All right. But, you\xc2\x92re gonna have to tell them. (He opens the cabinet\nto reveal the chick and the duck living inside with Christmas lights and a disco ball as\ndecorations.)'
Chandler	 (nods his head) Do you mind if we stick you in another cabinet? (to\nJoey) They seem all right with it!'

Chip	 (on machine) Hey Monica, it\xc2\x92s Chip.'
Monica	 Yesss!!'
Ross	 Who\xc2\x92s Chip?'
Monica	 Shhh!'
Chip	 (on machine) Good runnin\xc2\x92 into you at the bank today, so ah,\nhere\xc2\x92s my number, 555-9323. Give me a call. Later.'
Monica	 Chip, is Chip Matthews.'
Ross	 The guy who took Rachel to the prom? Why is he calling you?'
Monica	 \xc2\x91Cause I ran into him at the bank, he is still soo cute.'
Ross	 Monica, you\xc2\x92re so lucky! He\xc2\x92s like the most popular guy in\nschool!!'
Monica	 I know!! (calls him) (on phone) Chip? Hi! It\xc2\x92s Monica. (listens)\n\xc2\x91Kay. (listens) \xc2\x91Kay. (listens) Okay. (listens) Okay, good-bye. (hangs up) Oh my\nGod, we just had the best conversation!! (goes into her room as Rachel enters)'
Ross	 (to Rachel) I was just leaving.'
Rachel	 Good! \xc2\x91Cause I\xc2\x92ve got a product report to read, it\xc2\x92s like\neight pages, I hope I don\xc2\x92t fall asleep.'
Ross	 Why? Did you write it?'
Rachel	 (sees Chip\xc2\x92s phone number) Wow! Look at that, Chip Matthews called.\nI wonder what he wants?'
Ross	 Well ah, actually...'
Rachel	 (interrupting) I bet he sensed that I was ready to have sex with another\nguy.'
Ross	 Well, umm, why don\xc2\x92t you give him a call?'
Rachel	 Okay. (picks up phone) Are you sure you wanna hear this?'
Ross	 Oh, I\xc2\x92m sure.'
Rachel	 (on phone) Chip! Hi, it\xc2\x92s Rachel. (listens) Rachel Green. Yeah,\numm, you left me a message. (listens) Yes you did, my roommate wrote it down. (listens)\nMonica Geller. (listens) Ohh.'
Ross	 (whispering in her ear) Oh, that\xc2\x92s right! He called to ask out\nMonica! That-that\xc2\x92s gotta be embarrassing! '
Phoebe	 (screaming, angrily) ...DUMB, DRUNKEN, BITCH!!! (applause) (happily)\nThank you, thanks.'
Ross	 (reading the newspaper) Hey, here\xc2\x92s a question; where did you guys\nget the finest oak East of the Mississippi?'
Chandler	 Uh-huh, first you tell us where you got the prettiest lace in all the\nland.'
Ross	 I\xc2\x92m reading your ad.'
Joey	 Looks good, uh?'
Ross	 Yeah.'
Chandler	 (reading the ad) Stunning entertainment center. Fine, (pause) fine\nItalian craftsmanship. (Joey is very proud of himself)'
Phoebe	 Oh my God, you guys are selling the entertainment center?'
Rachel	 Why? I love that thing.'
Chandler	 You want it?'
Phoebe and Rachel	 Oh no.'
Chandler	 Ahh, Gepeto, $5,000 dollars? Are you insane?'
Joey	 Hey, the ad alone cost 300 bucks!'
Chandler	 All right look, I\xc2\x92m changing it to 50 bucks, or your best offer.'
Joey	 What kind of profit is that?! And you call yourself an accountant.'
Chandler	 (looks at him) Nooo.'
Joey	 Oh. What do you do?'
Chandler	 I can\xc2\x92t believe you don\xc2\x92t know what I do for a living!'
Phoebe	 Yeah, I actually don\xc2\x92t know...'
Ross	 Good, so do I'
Rachel	 Something to do with numbers?'
Phoebe	 Oh my God! No! Shoo! Kitty! No! No-no-no! Shoo! Come on, you! (goes over\nand picks up the cat) Come on. Crazy. (looks into the cat\xc2\x92s eyes) Oh my God.'
Rachel	 What?'
Phoebe	 Nothing. Nothing.'
Joey	 What? What\xc2\x92s wrong?'
Phoebe	 I just, I just have this really strong feeling that this cat is my\nMother.'
Rachel	 You mean the mom you met in Montauk. She was a cat?!'
Phoebe	 No, no-no, she was a human lady. This is the spirit of my Mom\nLily, the one who killed herself.'
Ross	 Are you sure she\xc2\x92s in the cat, or have you been taking your\ngrandma\xc2\x92s glycoma medicine again?'
Phoebe	 No Dr. Skeptismo! I\xc2\x92m sure. First of all, okay, there\xc2\x92s the\nfeeling. (Chandler shrugs) Okay, and for another, how about the fact that she went into my\nguitar case which is lined with orange felt. (Rachel nods her head in unsure agreement) My\nMother\xc2\x92s favourite fish is Orange Roughy... (Joey thinks he understands, but then\nnods that he has no clue.) Cats....like....fish! (Ross and Rachel are totally lost) (to\nthe cat) Hi, Mommy. (Rachel covers her mouth, in an \xc2\x93Oh my God.\xc2\x94 gesture) Oh, I\nhaven\xc2\x92t seen this smile in 17 years!'
Joey	 (to Chandler) Dude, Phoebe\xc2\x92s mom has got a huge peni...'
Chandler	 (interrupting) Let it go!!'
Monica	 Hey!'
Rachel	 Umm, when were you gonna tell me that you\xc2\x92re going out with Chip\nMatthews?'
Monica	 Now? Is it okay if I go out with Chip Matthews?'
Rachel	 Nooo! It\xc2\x92s not okay! I can\xc2\x92t believe you would want to after\nwhat he did to me!'
Monica	 What, that little thing at the prom?'
Rachel	 Monica! I couldn\xc2\x92t find him for two hours! He was having sex with\nAmy Welch!'
Monica	 Come on, that was back in high school! How could that still bother you?'
Rachel	 I mean why, of all people would you want to go out with Chip?!'
Monica	 Look, you and I went to different high schools...'
Rachel	 Okay, that doesn\xc2\x92t help me, because we went to the same high\nschool.'
Monica	 You went to one where you were popular, and you got to ride off\nChip\xc2\x92s motorcycle, and wear his letterman jacket. I went to one where I wore a band\nuniform they had to have specially made.'
Rachel	 (shocked) They had to have that specially made?!'
Monica	 It was a project for one of the Home Ec classes.'
Rachel	 (stunned) Oh my God, they told us that was for the mascot!'
Monica	 Back then, I thought that I would never, ever get the chance to go out\nwith a Chip Matthews, and now he\xc2\x92s-he\xc2\x92s called me up and asked me out. And the\nfat girl inside of me really wants to go. I-I owe her this. I never let her eat.'
Rachel	 Oh, you go out with him. (goes over and hugs her) '
Monica	 Oh, really?!'
Rachel	 Yeah. Just, if it\xc2\x92s possible, could you leave him somewhere and go\nhave sex with another guy?'
Monica	 I\xc2\x92ll try.'
Ross	 So you guys having any luck getting rid of the entertainment center?'
Joey	 Well, there were a couple of calls last night, but ah, I don\xc2\x92t think\nany of them are gonna work out.'
Chandler	 Yes, Joey has a very careful screening process. Apparently, not\neveryone is qualified to own wood and nails.'
Phoebe	 (is struggling with the cat) Stop it! Stop it! She keeps squirming,\ntrying to get away! Just like when she was alive.'
Ross	 So Pheebs, how long is your mom gonna be with us?'
Phoebe	 Well, I\xc2\x92m not sure. I mean, I guess until she y'know, gets used to\nthe fact that there\xc2\x92s y'know, a new mom. Y'know, I think she\xc2\x92s worried that\ny'know, she\xc2\x92s gonna, she\xc2\x92s gonna be replaced. (to the cat, in a funny voice)\nWell, that\xc2\x92s not gonna happen is it? Noo. (gets up) Okay, I have to return a call in\nthe other room."
Monica	 Why can\xc2\x92t you use the phone in here?'
Phoebe	 Well, I\xc2\x92m returning a call from a certain mom at the B-E-A-C-H. I\njust spelled the wrong word. (goes into Monica\xc2\x92s room)'
Ross	 So, guys, am I crazy, or does Phoebe\xc2\x92s mom remind anyone of a cat?'
Monica	 Ross, don\xc2\x92t start.'
Ross	 Come on, you-you can\xc2\x92t tell me you actually believe that-that\nthere\xc2\x92s a woman inside that cat!'
Rachel	 I believe it.'
Ross	 No you don\xc2\x92t. '
Rachel	 Yes, I do.'
Ross	 No you do\xc2\x97y'know what, you\xc2\x92re not gonna suck me into this."
Rachel	 Oh sure I am, because you always have to be right.'
Ross	 I do not always have to be\xc2\x97okay, okay. (starts to leave)'
Rachel	 Jurassic Park could happen.'
Tony	 Wow! That\xc2\x92s ah, that\xc2\x92s pretty nice!'
Joey	 Pretty nice?'
Chandler	 You\xc2\x92ll have to pardon my roommate, he wanted to marry this.'
Tony	 We don\xc2\x92t have 50 bucks, but would you be willing to trade for it?\nWe\xc2\x92ve got a canoe.'
Chandler	 Y'know, I, I really don\xc2\x92t think we need a canoe."
Tony	 You gotta take the canoe!'
Chandler	 All right, just, just take the entertainment center, and then when you\nget home, throw the canoe away!'
Peter	 We\xc2\x92re not throwing it away! I built that canoe! (starts to leave as\nTony chases after him)'
Joey	 (to Peter) Good for you!!'
Rachel	 (entering) You guys, you\xc2\x92re never gonna believe what I just found\ntacked up on a telephone pole! (She\xc2\x92s holding a flyer.) Look kinda familiar?'
Ross	 (taking the flyer) Apparently Phoebe\xc2\x92s mother also goes by the name\nJulio.'
Rachel	 You guys, there\xc2\x92s a little girl in Soho looking for this cat. I\nmean, you know what that means?!'
Joey	 (looking at the flyer) Yeah-eah! 200 dollar reward, split five ways!!'
Rachel	 Do we have to tell her?'
Ross	 Yes, we have to tell her!'
Monica	 Oh, but it\xc2\x92s made her so happy.'
Ross	 (holds up a hand) Little girl misses her cat. (hold up the other hand)\nCrazy lady thinks her mother is in a cat. (gets up) Okay, y'know what, I have to go have\ndinner with my son, can I trust that when you see Phoebe, you will tell her."
All	 (disappointed) Yeah.'
Ross	 Thank you.'
Rachel	 I hate when Ross is right!'
Monica	 He is right, isn\xc2\x92t he?'
Chandler	 Y'know what, I think this might be one of the times he\xc2\x92s wrong."
All	 You think?'
Chandler	 Oh-no, he\xc2\x92s right.'

Phoebe	 (entering, with Julio) Hi. (sits down in the chair)'
Monica	 Hi!'
All	 Hey!'
Joey	 Uh, Pheebs, about your mom...'
Phoebe	 Yeah?'
Joey	 (pause) How\xc2\x92s that going?'
Phoebe	 So great. Oh, we took a nap today and my Mom fell asleep on my tummy and\npurred.'
Joey	 That\xc2\x92s so sweet. (pause) I\xc2\x92m gonna get some coffee. (gets up and\nleaves)'
Monica	 (sliding into Joey\xc2\x92s place on the couch to try and talk to Phoebe)\nHuh? What\xc2\x92d ya say Joe? I\xc2\x92ll be right there. (gets up and joins Joey)'
Rachel	 Pheebs...'
Phoebe	 I just feel so, uhh.....'
Rachel	 All right!!'
Chandler	 I\xc2\x92m coming already!!'
Rachel	 Jeez!'
Monica	 (running from the bathroom to her room, wearing only a towel) Not yet!\nNot yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! (gets to her room and\ncloses the door, as Rachel gets up to answer the door.)'
Rachel	 Hello, Chip.'
Chip	 Hey, Rach! How ya doin\xc2\x92?'
Rachel	 I\xc2\x92m great! I\xc2\x92m great. I\xc2\x92ve got a great job at Bloomingdale\xc2\x92s,\nhave wonderful friends, and eventhough I\xc2\x92m not seeing anyone right now, I\xc2\x92ve\nnever felt better about myself.'
Chip	 So ah, Monica ready yet?'
Rachel	 She\xc2\x92ll be out in a second. So, Chip, how\xc2\x92s umm, Amy Welch?'
Chip	 Amy Welch? Wow! I haven\xc2\x92t seen her since... So, Monica about ready?'
Joey	 This is the unit for you my friend. Sturdy construction, tons of storage\ncompartments, some big enough to fit a grown man.'
Guy	 What?!'
Joey	 Oh yeah! I got in there myself once. My roommate bet me five bucks that I\ncouldn\xc2\x92t, and then he stuck a board through the handles that locked me in. Yeah. It\nwas funny \xc2\x91til I started feeling like I was in a coffin.'
Guy	 No, you, you can\xc2\x92t fit in that thing. That\xc2\x92s not deep enough.'
Joey	 Oh yeah? (opens up the center and takes out the stereo) If I can\xc2\x92t,\nI\xc2\x92ll knock five bucks off the price off the unit.'
Guy	 All right, you have yourself a deal. (shakes his hand)'
Joey	 Okay. (he gets in the unit and closes the door) See?! I told ya! '
Joey	 Sometimes I get in here just to get away from it! Hey, a nickel!!'
Chip	 Here, we are.'
Monica	 Oh my God! You still have the Chipper!'
Chip	 The what?'
Monica	 That\xc2\x92s what we used to call your ah, your motorcycle in high\nschool. Y'know how a motorcycle is a Chopper, and you\xc2\x92re Chip. Nevermind."
Chip	 No, I think it\xc2\x92s cute. (kisses her)'
Monica	 Wow! A lipper from Chipper.'
Chip	 So you still in touch with anyone from high school?'
Monica	 Umm. Well, there\xc2\x92s Rachel, and umm, I think that\xc2\x92s it. How\nbout you?'
Chip	 Oh yeah, I still hang with Simmons and Zana, y'know. I see Spindler a lot.\nDevane, Kelly, and I run into Goldie from time to time. Steve Brown, Zuchoff, McGwire,\nJ.T., Breadsly."
Monica	 Is that all?'
Chip	 Ehh, y'know after high school, you just kinda lose touch. Oh yeah! I ran\ninto Richard Dorfman."
Monica	 Ohh, how is he?'
Chip	 Not so good, Simmons and I gave him a wedgie.'
Monica	 Isn\xc2\x92t he an architect now?'
Chip	 Yeah, they still wear underwear.'
Chandler	 OH MY GOD!!!'
Joey	 (still trapped in the entertainment center) WHAT?!! '
Chandler	 Are you all right?!'
Joey	 Yeah...'
Chandler	 (lets him out) What happened?!!'
Joey	 (getting out) Awww, man! He promised he wouldn\xc2\x92t take the chairs!!'
Chandler	 What the hell happened?!! How were you locked in?!! And where the hell\nis all of our stuff?!!'
Joey	 Well, this guy came by to look at the unit and-and he said he didn\xc2\x92t\nthink big enough to fit a grown man!'
Chandler	 So\xc2\x97You got in voluntarily?!'
Joey	 I was tryin\xc2\x92 to make a sale!! Oh, man, if I ever run into that guy\nagain, do you know what I\xc2\x92m gonna do?'
Chandler	 BEND OVER?!!!'
Chip	 ...and then Zana, just let one rip!! (laughs histerically)'
Monica	 Look, not that I enjoy talking about people who I went to high school\nwith, \xc2\x91cause I do, but umm, maybe we could talk about something else? Like you, I\ndon\xc2\x92t even know where you work?'
Chip	 You know where I work!'
Monica	 I do?'
Chip	 The movie theatre, you used to come in all the time.'
Monica	 You still work at the multiplex?'
Chip	 Oh, like I\xc2\x92d give up that job! Free popcorn and candy, anytime I\nwant. I can get you free posters for your room.'
Monica	 Thanks, I\xc2\x92m set. Do you still live with your parents?'
Chip	 Oh yeah, but I can stay out as late as I want.'
Rachel	 Wow! They really got you guys. Your T.V. The chairs.'
Phoebe	 Oh yeah, your microwave. The stereo.'
Joey	 (looking through a deck of cards) Aww, man, he took the five of spades!!\nOh, no-no-no, here it is!'
Monica	 (entering) Oh my God! What happened?'
Chandler	 Oh, umm, Joey was born, and then 28 years later, I was robbed!!'
Rachel	 (to Monica) So, how was your date?'
Monica	 Well, y'know how I always wanted to go out with Chip Matthews in high\nschool?"
Rachel	 Um-hmm.'
Monica	 Well, tonight, I actually went out with Chip Matthews in high school.'
Rachel	 Oh honey, I\xc2\x92m sorry.'
Monica	 No, it\xc2\x92s okay, not only did I get to go out with Chip Matthews, I\ngot to dump Chip Matthews.'
Rachel	 Ohh! That\xc2\x92s so great!'
Monica	 I know!'
Ross	 (entering) Hey! So ah, what did the insurance company say?'
Chandler	 Oh, they said uh, \xc2\x93You don\xc2\x92t have insurance here, so stop\ncalling us.\xc2\x94'
Ross	 (seeing Phoebe still with cat) You didn\xc2\x92t tell her?! (They all kinda\nshy away.) Okay, fine! Pheebs?'
Phoebe	 Yeah? (sees Ross) Hi!'
Ross	 Hi! Listen uhh, this cat belongs to a little girl. There are flyers all\nover the place.'
Rachel	 I\xc2\x92m sorry, sweetie. (shows her the flyer)'
Monica	 Hey, we can take her back with you if you want.'
Phoebe	 Ohh. Um-hmm. But y'know, she choose to find me. I mean, I have to\nrespect her decision. Right?"
Chandler, Monica, Joey, and Rachel	 That\xc2\x92s a good call. Right.'
Ross	 No! No! Look\xc2\x97Hey, enough is enough! Look, I am sorry that you feel\nguilty or whatever about spending time with your new mom, but this is not your old mom.\nThis is a cat! Okay, Julio the cat! Not mom! Cat!'
Phoebe	 (she turns around and puts the cat on the entertainment center) Ross,\nhow many parents have you lost?'
Ross	 None.'
Phoebe	 Okay, then you don\xc2\x92t know what it feels like when one of them comes\nback. Do you? I believe this is my Mother. Even if I\xc2\x92m wrong, who cares? Just be a\nfriend. Okay? Be supportive.'
Ross	 I\xc2\x92m sorry.'
Phoebe	 Okay.'
Ross	 I don\xc2\x92t know what to say.'
Rachel	 You could.... say you\xc2\x92re sorry to her mom.'
Phoebe	 I think she would like that.'
Ross	 (goes over to Julio) Come here, here, come here, come here, (pause) Mrs.\nBuffay. Sorry, about what I said, umm, it was, it was insensitive of me to say that you\nwere just a cat. When clearly you are also the reincarnated spirit, of my friend\xc2\x92s\nmother.'
Phoebe	 Thank you. We both forgive you.'
Rachel	 So honey, what are you gonna do about the little girl?'
Phoebe	 Yeah, okay, listen, umm, Mom, I hope you know you still mean a lot to\nme. And you\xc2\x92re welcome to come back anytime.'
Chandler	 Pheebs, if she could come back as a couch, we\xc2\x92d really appreciate\nit. (Joey nods in agreement)'
Phoebe	 Come on, Mom, I\xc2\x92ll take you home.'
Rachel	 I\xc2\x92ll go with you.'
Monica	 Me too. (they all leave)'
Ross	 Oh! Y'know, I\xc2\x92ve got an extra futon."
Joey	 Dude, you don\xc2\x92t have to brag! We got nothing here!!'
