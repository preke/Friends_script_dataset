Phoebe	 Hey! New wallet, huh?'
Chandler	 Yeah, it was time. The old condom ring in the leather just\ndoesn\xc2\x92t say \xc2\x91cool\xc2\x92 anymore.'
Monica	 Rachel!'
Rachel	 What?'
Monica	 You just put an empty carton back in the fridge!'
Rachel	 Oh yeah, I know, but the garbage was full.'
Monica	 Have you ever taken out the trash? (Hands her the garbage.)'
Rachel	 Well, I thought you liked doing it. (Rachel starts out the door\nand stops.)'
Monica	 Third door on the left.'
Rachel	 Right!'
Rachel	 Oh! Hey, Mr. Treeger.'
Mr. Treeger	
Mr. Treeger	
Rachel	 Ummm. Oh! I\xc2\x92m sorry. (She grabs the box and offers him a piece.)\nIt\xc2\x92s a little old but\xc2\x85'
Mr. Treeger	
Rachel	 I\xc2\x92m sorry. I didn\xc2\x92t\xc2\x97I don\xc2\x92t come in here a lot.'
Mr. Treeger	
Rachel	 No.'
Mr. Treeger	
Rachel	 I didn\xc2\x92t\xc2\x85 I never said that.'
Mr. Treeger	
Rachel	 (starting to cry) Okay, I\xc2\x92m sorry. (Runs out still carrying the\npizza box.)'
Monica	 God! If you\xc2\x92re gonna cry about it! (She grabs the box and goes to\nthrough it out.]'

Joey	 Whoa-whoa, Treeger made you cry?'
Rachel	 Yes! And he said really mean things that were only partly true. '
Joey	 I\xc2\x92m gonna go down there and teach that guy a lesson.'
Monica	 Joey, please don\xc2\x92t do that. I think it\xc2\x92s best that we just\nforget about it.'
Rachel	 That\xc2\x92s easy for you to say, you weren\xc2\x92t almost just killed.'
Joey	 All right that\xc2\x92s it, school is in session! (Exits and slams the\ndoor.)'
Monica	 (Picking up a card from Chandler\xc2\x92s wallet.) My God! Is this a gym\ncard?'
Chandler	 Oh yeah, gym member. I try to go four times a week, but I\xc2\x92ve\nmissed the last 1200 times.'
Ross	 So why don\xc2\x92t you quit?'
Chandler	 You don\xc2\x92t think I\xc2\x92ve tried? You think I like having\n50 dollars taken out of my bank account every month? No, they make you go all the way down\nthere! Then they use all of these phrases and peppiness to try and confuse you! Then they\nbring out Maria.'
Ross	 Who is Maria?'
Chandler	 Oh Maria. You can\xc2\x92t say no to her, she\xc2\x92s like this lycra\nspandex covered gym\xc2\x85treat.'
Ross	 You need me to go down there with you and hold your hand?'
Chandler	 No!'
Ross	 So you\xc2\x92re strong enough to face her on your own?'
Chandler	 Oh no, you\xc2\x92ll have to come.'
Mr. Treeger	
Joey	 Hey! You hold on pal! Now you made my friend, Rachel, cry. So now,\nyou\xc2\x92re gonna go up there and apologize to her, unless you want me to call the\nlandlord.'
Mr. Treeger	
Joey	 Have you heard about a little something called, Not Making Girls Cry.'
Mr. Treeger	
Joey	 I have actually not heard of that.'
Mr. Treeger	
Joey	 Why don\xc2\x92t you tell me something I don\xc2\x92t know! (He storms out,\nand once Treeger closes the door behind him, Joey makes an \xc2\x91Oops!\xc2\x92 have.)'
Phoebe	 Oh please, somebody tell me I don\xc2\x92t have to go to work today!'
Monica	 What\xc2\x92s the matter?'
Phoebe	 Oh, my first massage today is this incredibly gorgeous guy, and every\ntime I see him I just want to do things to him that I\xc2\x92m not allowed to charge for.'
Monica	 So do them for free.'
Phoebe	 Oh no, it is forbidden! No-no, Mrs. Potter fires people for fooling\naround with clients. And it\xc2\x92s against my oath as a masseuse.'
Ross	 They make you take an oath?'
Phoebe	 No, I made myself take an oath. Yeah, no fooling around with clients and\numm, always be prepared. Yeah, that one\xc2\x92s actually from the Boy Scouts, but it just\nmakes good sense.'
Chandler	 Why don\xc2\x92t you just give him to somebody else?'
Phoebe	 No, I can handle it. No, I\xc2\x92m a professional. (She starts to leave)'
Rachel	 Oh Pheebs, is that a new ankle bracelet?'
Monica	 Wow! And you got a petticure. Your feet are all dressed up.'
Chandler	 Because that\xc2\x92s the only part of you he can see when he\xc2\x92s on\nthe table!'
Monica	 You\xc2\x92re gonna do some feet flirtin\xc2\x92!'
Phoebe	 I don\xc2\x92t what your talking about. (Laughs nervously and continues to\nleaqve)'
Ross	 Then how do you explain the toe ring?!'
Phoebe	 Because it\xc2\x92s Arabian princess day at work! Okay?! Leave me alone!'
Rachel	 Oh! My hero! What happened?'
Joey	 Well uh, I went down there and told him that no one treats my friends like\nthat and that he\xc2\x92d better come up here and apologize. I\xc2\x92ll see you later.\n(Starts to leave)'
Monica	 What a minute, what did he say?'
Joey	 He said that he wasn\xc2\x92t gonna apologize because you guys are living\nhere illegally, so instead what he\xc2\x92s gonna do is have you evicted\xc2\x97I\xc2\x92ll see\nyou later.'
Rachel	 What?! You got us evicted!!'
Monica	 I told you not to go down there!'
Joey	 Well he made Rachel cry!'
Monica	 Rachel always cries!'
Rachel	 That\xc2\x92s not true! (Starts to cry.)'
Monica	 Now Joey, you go down there and you suck up to him. I mean you suck like\nyou\xc2\x92ve never sucked before!'
Joey	 All right! I\xc2\x92ll try! But if I can\xc2\x92t, you can stay with Chandler\nand I until you get settled.'
Rachel	 Go!!'
Joey	 All right, all right, all right. (Starts to leave, stops, and turns\naround) I mean I\xc2\x92ll have to check with him first, but I\xc2\x92ll think he\xc2\x92ll be\ncool with it. (Monica shoos him out.)'
Ross	 Whoa-whoa-whoa, hey! Now remember what we talked about, you gotta be\nstrong.'
Chandler	 Yes. (In a stronger voice) Yes!'
Ross	 One more time, "Hey, don\xc2\x92t you want a washboard stomach and rock\nhard pecs?"'
Chandler	 No! I want a flabby gut and saggy man breasts!'
Ross	 Good! That\xc2\x92s good!'
Chandler	 Okay. (They go inside) (To the guy at the desk) I wanna quit the gym.'
Gym Employee	 You wanna quit?'
Chandler	 I wanna quit the gym.'
Gym Employee	 You do realize that you won\xc2\x92t have access to our new full\nservice Swedish spa.'
Chandler	 (He turns to Ross and Ross makes a \xc2\x91Be strong\xc2\x92 sound.) I\nwanna quit the gym.'
Gym Employee	 Okay, Dave in the membership office, handles quitters. (Both\nChandler and Ross start to make their way to the membership office.) Uh, excuse me, (to\nRoss) are you a member?'
Ross	 Me? No.'
Gym Employee	 Sorry, members only.'
Chandler	 (horrified at the prospect of trying to quit alone and unsure about\nhimself) I wanna quit the gym.'
Ross	 It\xc2\x92s okay man, be strong. (Chandler goes into the office.)'
Gym Employee	 (to Ross) So, are you a member of any gym.'
Ross	 No! And I\xc2\x92m not gonna be, so you can save you little speech.'
Gym Employee	 Okay, no problem. (To someone out of the picture) Could you come\nhere for a second?'
Woman	 Hi, I\xc2\x92m Maria.'
Rick	 (looking at her feet) Wow, you have really pretty feet.'
Phoebe	 These old things.'
Rick	 Would you mind spending some time on my siadic area, it\xc2\x92s been\nkilling me today.'
Phoebe	 You mean the\xc2\x97Okay by siadic, you mean the towel covered portion.'
Rick	 Yeah.'
Phoebe	 Sure, yeah, no I can do that, yeah, because umm, y'know, the muscles in\nthe siadic area can get y\xc2\x92know, real (lifts up the towel) nice and tight. So umm,\ntell me Rick, how umm, how did you injure the area."
Rick	 Oh, a 16-hour sit-in for Greenpeace.'
Phoebe	 Oh. (She goes to work, and her head slowly drops out of view.)'
Rick	 Ow! Did you just bite me?'
Phoebe	 No!'
Mr. Treeger	
Joey	 Please don\xc2\x92t kick Monica and Rachel out, this wasn\xc2\x92t there\nfault, it was mine.'
Mr. Treeger	
Joey	 No you can\xc2\x92t do that, where would the chick and the duck live?'
Mr. Treeger	
Joey	 Noo-no-no, no, those are nicknames. I\xc2\x92m the chick and Chandler is the\nduck.'
Mr. Treeger	
Joey	 Come on man, just-just let the girls stay, I\xc2\x92ll do whatever you want.'
Mr. Treeger	
Joey	 Yeah-yeah, absolutely.'
Mr. Treeger	
Joey	 What, what is it?'
Mr. Treeger

Rachel	 Well, why doesn\xc2\x92t he practice with a girl?'
Joey	 Well, he\xc2\x92s too shy, he doesn\xc2\x92t thing he\xc2\x92s good enough to\ndance with girls yet.'
Rachel	 Yeah, right, he almost danced me right down that\xc2\x85garbage chute.\n(Starts to cry)'

Ross	 And that\xc2\x92s funny, why?'
Rachel	 Oh, umm, I was just y\xc2\x92know working out and umm\xc2\x85 Oh,\nthat\xc2\x92s it.'
Chandler	 We\xc2\x92re doomed. Okay, they\xc2\x92re gonna take 50 bucks out of our\naccounts for the rest of our lives. What are we gonna do?'
Monica	 Well, you could actually go to the gym.'
Ross	 Or! Or, we could go to the bank, close our accounts and cut them off at\nthe source.'
Chandler	 You\xc2\x92re a genius!'
Joey	 Aww, man, now we won\xc2\x92t be bank buddies!'
Chandler	 Now, there\xc2\x92s two reasons.'
