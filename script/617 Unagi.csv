Ross	 Hey, remember when I had a monkey?'
Chandler	 Yeah.'
Ross	 Yeah, what, what was I thinking?'
Joey	 (he\xc2\x92s just picked up their bill) Hey! So, what\xc2\x92s with the 20\npercent tip? Did I do something wrong?'
Chandler	 Twenty percent is a pretty generous tip Joe.'
Joey	 Y\xc2\x92know what\xc2\x92s more generous than that?! Fifty percent!\nY\xc2\x92know what\xc2\x92s even more generous than that?!!'
Chandler	 I see where you\xc2\x92re goin\xc2\x92!'
Ross	 What\xc2\x92s up with the greed Joe?'
Joey	 All right, look I\xc2\x92m sorry you guys, but it\xc2\x92s just that I gotta\nget these new head shots made. And they\xc2\x92re really expensive, y\xc2\x92know? I\xc2\x92m\ndown to like three! Well, actually two \xc2\x91cause one of \xc2\x91em I kinda blackened in\nsome teeth\xc2\x97Why did I do that?! (Hits himself in the head.)'
Ross	 Well isn\xc2\x92t there something you can do to earn a little extra money? I\nmean, can\xc2\x92t-can\xc2\x92t you pick up, I don\xc2\x92t know, an extra shift here?'
Phoebe	 Or, y\xc2\x92know, I used to beg for money. Of course it helps if\nyou\xc2\x92ve got y\xc2\x92know a little of this (she sticks her chest out and shakes it)\ngoin\xc2\x92 on. Wow! I still have it!'
Ross	 Oh, wait! Wait! Don\xc2\x92t you have an audition today? Yeah! Maybe\nyou\xc2\x92ll get that job!'
Joey	 Oh, ha-ha-ha! Ooh! Wait a minute, I used to get medical experiments down\non me all the time!'
Chandler	 (reminiscing) Ah, finally an explanation.'
Joey	 No-no! I used to get paid for all kinds of medical stuff, remember?\nLet\xc2\x92s see uh, well I don\xc2\x92t want to donate sperm again. (To Ross) I really prefer\ndoing that at the home office y\xc2\x92know? (Ross nods his head.) Ooh-ooh, maybe they want\nlike some of my blood or-or spit or something, huh?'
Gunther	 (approaching with a tray with an order on it) Joey!'
Joey	 Yeah?'
Gunther	 What did I tell you about talking to your friends while you\xc2\x92re\nworking?'
Joey	 Uhh do it?'
Gunther	 That guy (points) has been waiting for his coffee for ten minutes!\nHe\xc2\x92s complained about you three times! (He hands the coffee cup to Joey, assuming\nthat Joey will deliver it and walks away.)'
Joey	 Well, where was I? (Takes a sip of the coffee.)'

Ross	 Hi!'
Phoebe	 Hey!'
Ross	 Hey, what have you guys been up to?'
Phoebe	 Ohh! We went to a self-defense class today!'
Ross	 Wow!'
Rachel	 Yeah, kicking a guy in the crotch all morning really takes it out of ya!'
Joey	 Takes it out of you? (Laughs.)'
Phoebe	 Now, we can kick anybody\xc2\x92s ass!'
Rachel	 Yeah!'
Ross	 After one class? I don\xc2\x92t think so.'
Rachel	 What? You wanna see me self-defend myself?! Go over there (points) and\npretend you\xc2\x92re a sexual predator! Go on! I dare ya!!'
Ross	 Well, of course you can defend yourself from an attack you know is coming,\nthat\xc2\x92s not enough. Look, I studying kara-tay for a long time, and there\xc2\x92s a\nconcept you should really be familiar with. It\xc2\x92s what the Japanese call (he holds two\nfingers up to his temple, and he does this every time he says this word) unagi.'
Rachel	 Isn\xc2\x92t that a kind of sushi?'
Ross	 No, it\xc2\x92s a concept!'
Phoebe	 Yeah it is! It is! It\xc2\x92s freshwater eel!'
Ross	 All right, maybe it means that too\xc2\x85'
Rachel	 Ohh! I would kill for a salmon skin roll right now!'
Ross	 Y\xc2\x92know what? Fine! Get attacked! I don\xc2\x92t even care! '
Phoebe	 (deadpan) Come on Ross. We\xc2\x92re sorry. Please tell us what it is.'
Ross	 Unagi is a state of total awareness. Okay? Only by achieving true unagi\ncan you be prepared for any danger that may befall you!'
Phoebe	 You mean in case someone is trying to steal your bamboo sleeping mat or\nyour kettle of fish?'
Ross	 (moves closer) All I\xc2\x92m saying is, it\xc2\x92s one thing being prepared\nfor an attack against like each other; whole another story being prepared for an attack, I\ndon\xc2\x92t know, like a (turns and puts his face close to Rachel\xc2\x92s and screams) surprise!!'
Ross	 All right, you know that one was coming, but that doesn\xc2\x92t mean you\nhave unagi. (Does the finger thing.)'
Rachel	 (To Phoebe) Ooh! Y\xc2\x92know what? If we made reservations, we could\nhave unagi in about a half-hour.'
Ross	 Y\xc2\x92know what\xc2\x85 (Moves away as Chandler enters, panicked.)'
Chandler	 Hey-hey, is Monica here?'
Phoebe	 No.'
Ross	 No.'
Chandler	 Okay, look I need your help, I don\xc2\x92t know what to get her for\nValentine\xc2\x92s Day.'
Rachel	 Well, Valentine\xc2\x92s Day was like two weeks ago, so I wouldn\xc2\x92t\nget her a calendar!'
Chandler	 (laughs) She was working on Valentine\xc2\x92s Day so we\xc2\x92re\ncelebrating it tonight.'
Joey	 Ohh, hey! Why don\xc2\x92t you book a date for both of you at one of those\nromantic spas?'
Phoebe	 Ooh, Joey, that\xc2\x92s actually a really good idea!'
Joey	 And of course, crotchless panties. '
Chandler	 Well appealing as that does sound to her boyfriend (pause) and her\nbrother, (the camera pans to Ross flashing Joey a very evil look; Joey gets scared) I\ncan\xc2\x92t do that we promised we\xc2\x92d make each other gifts this year.'
Rachel	 Aw, I love that.'
Phoebe	 You guys!'
Joey	 You can\xc2\x92t make crotchless panties? You take, you take a pair of\nscissors and you just cut\xc2\x85'
Rachel	 (interrupting him) Okay-okay-okay! So, making things. That sounds like\nso much fun.'
Chandler	 Yeah, I thought so to until I paper mached one of my eyes shut.'
Phoebe	 Oh, I love paper mache! What did you make?'
Chandler	 I made a\xc2\x85 (Does one of those gibberish words.)'
Phoebe	 What is that?'
Chandler	 Nothing!'
Ross	 So what are you gonna do?'
Chandler	 Well, have you guys made anything that maybe I can take credit for?'
Phoebe	 Ohh! I have! I have! I started making these little sock bunnies! (She\ntakes out a sock that\xc2\x92s been made into a bunny with eyes, nose, mouth, whiskers, and\ntwo other socks sown onto it for ears.) Oh for crying out loud!'
Rachel	 Hey, wait a minute! That is my sock!'
Phoebe	 Now, it\xc2\x92s you little bunny friend. (She sticks it in Rachel\xc2\x92s\nface and they both laugh.)'
Chandler	 (admiring his work) This, this actually is a\xc2\x85 (Does the same\ngibberish word from before.)'
Monica	 (entering) Hey!'
Chandler	 Hey! Honey, can I ask you a question about the Valentine\xc2\x92s Day\ngifts?'
Monica	 Oh, yeah.'
Chandler	 Do we have to make the entire thing?'
Monica	 Yes! Why, did you\xc2\x97you forget to make yours?'
Chandler	 Of course, of course not. I just have to uh, go over to the place\nwhere I-I made it and pick-pick it up.'
Monica	 Okay. (They kiss.) Okay, I can\xc2\x92t wait! This is going to be the best\nValentine\xc2\x92s Day ever! (Chandler giggles and exits.) I can\xc2\x92t believe it! Make the\npresents! Make the presents!'
Chandler	 (sticking his head back in) What?'
Monica	 I\xc2\x92m just so excited to make the presents! (Chandler does another\nsarcastic/scared laugh and leaves.) Shoot!'
Joey	 (to the receptionist) Hi uh, I\xc2\x92m Joey Tribbiani and with all do\nrespect I\xc2\x92d like to donate some fluids.'
Receptionist	 We\xc2\x92re actually at the end of one of our research cycles, so\nwe\xc2\x92re not looking for applicants right now.'
Joey	 Oh that\xc2\x92s too bad. I\xc2\x92ve kinda been saving up. (She just looks at\nhim in horror.) Uh, are you sure there\xc2\x92s no studies I can participate in?'
Receptionist	 Well, here\xc2\x92s a schedule of what\xc2\x92s coming up. (Hands it\nto him.)'
Joey	 Thanks. (Starts to read it.) Well but this one starts now. (Points to\none.)'
Receptionist	 Oh that one is available now, but only identical twins are\neligible. It\xc2\x92s a twins study. '
Joey	 But it\xc2\x92s $2,000.'
Receptionist	 Sorry.'
Joey	 Well how about this one? Testing the effects of Joey Tribbiani on\nattractive nurse receptionists.'
Receptionist	 We already got the results back on that on, and they\xc2\x92re not\ngood. (Joey beats a hasty retreat.)'
Ross	 DANGER!!! DANGER!!!!!'
Phoebe	 Ross!!!'
Rachel	 What the hell was that?!'
Ross	 A lesson in the importance of unagi. (He starts doing the finger thing\nevery time now.)'
Phoebe	 Ohh, you\xc2\x92re a freak!!'
Ross	 Perhaps. Now I\xc2\x92m curious, at what point during those girlish screams\nwould you have begun to kick my ass?'
Rachel	 All right, so we weren\xc2\x92t prepared!'
Ross	 I\xc2\x92m sorry I had to take such drastic measures to make my point, but\nI\xc2\x97look, I just want you guys to be safe. (Monica comes out to throw out the garbage\nand Ross screams\xc2\x85) DANGER!!!!! (She completely ignores him and keeps walking.)\nAhhh, huh? Unagi.'
Joey	 (in his head) 2,000 bucks is a lot of money. Oh, I wish I had a twin.\nWhere could I find someone who looks exactly like me? (The camera widens its shot to\nreveal a room full of Joey look-a-likes. Joey looks at the guy next to him and then back\nat his script.)'
Chandler	 Hey.'
Ross	 (not turning around) Chandler. I sensed it was you.'
Chandler	 What?!'
Ross	 Unagi. I\xc2\x92m always aware.'
Chandler	 Okay, are you aware unagi (does the finger thing) is an eel?'
Ross	 What\xc2\x92s up?'
Chandler	 I can\xc2\x92t figure out what to make Monica.'
Ross	 Oh, why don\xc2\x92t you make her one of your little jokes.'
Chandler	 I\xc2\x92m going crazy! Okay? Do you have any thing around here that\nlooks homemade?'
Ross	 Y\xc2\x92know what? She\xc2\x92d-she\xc2\x92d love this. (Picks up a model of\nthe Saturn V rocket, that\xc2\x92s the one that took man to the moon.) Uh, it\xc2\x92s an\nexact replica of Apollo 8. I made it in the sixth grade.'
Chandler	 Yeah, I guess I could use that. I could say that your love sends me to\nthe moon.'
Ross	 Yeah-yeah, except Apollo 8 didn\xc2\x92t actually land on the moon. But\nyou-you-you could write that umm, your love lets me orbit the moon twice and return\nsafely. (Apollo 8 was the first one that orbited the moon and the one that read the\nChristmas Story from the orbit of the moon on Christmas Eve, 1968. They also took the\nfamous Earthrise picture of the Earth rising over the moon.)'
Chandler	 Wait a minute, I can\xc2\x92t give this to her.'
Ross	 Why not?'
Chandler	 Because it says "Captain Ross" on the side and "I hate\nMonica" on the bottom.'
Ross	 Oh.'
Phoebe and Rachel	 DANGER!!!!!'
Rachel	 Ahhhhh, salmon skin roll. (She does the finger thing.)'
Chandler	 Okay. Okay. (He goes to the closet, moves the clothes out of the way,\nand notices an empty hanger. He takes the empty hanger and bends it all out of shape. Then\nhe holds it out as if he\xc2\x92s giving it to her.) Yes honey, I made it myself. (He throws\nit down and goes to her chest, grabs something, goes to the bed table, and takes out a\npair of scissors. He turns around and holds the scissors to the crotch of the panties he\njust removed.) I can\xc2\x92t do it. I can\xc2\x92t do it. (He throws them both down and\ncontinues looking. He opens another closet door and finds a tape.) Oh! Oh! A mixed tape! A\nmixed tape!! (He runs out into the living room.)'
Chandler	 Hey! Hi! You uh, ready to exchange gifts?'
Monica	 Sure! Okay, you go first.'
Chandler	 Okay, come here! Come here.'
Monica	 Okay! (She takes her present for him and they move over to sit on the\ncouch.)'
Chandler	 Now, it\xc2\x92s not wrapped because I just, just finished it.'
Monica	 Okay.'
Chandler	 But I made you a tape of what I think are all romantic songs.'
Monica	 Oh, what a great gift! Is The Way You Look Tonight on it?!'
Chandler	 (momentarily terrified) Maybe we\xc2\x92ll have to listen and see!'
Monica	 Oh, I love it! Thank you so much!'
Chandler	 Okay!'
Monica	 Okay, you ready to open yours?'
Chandler	 Yeah!'
Monica	 Okay.'
Chandler	 It\xc2\x92s a sock bunny.'
Monica	 Yeah-yeah, you remember how I call you bunny?'
Chandler	 Not really.'
Monica	 Well, I did one time, and-and I want to start doing it more. See\nthat\xc2\x92s what this is about.'
Chandler	 I see. Y\xc2\x92know umm, Phoebe makes sock bunnies.'
Monica	 No! No, she doesn\xc2\x92t. Uh Phoebe, what she makes\xc2\x97that\xc2\x92s\nuh\xc2\x97they\xc2\x92re sock rabbits. They are completely different\xc2\x97Okay! Okay! Okay! I\ndidn\xc2\x92t make it! I\xc2\x92m sorry! I totally forgot about tonight and the fact that\nwe\xc2\x92re supposed to make the presents!'
Chandler	 Oh, it\xc2\x92s okay. I don\xc2\x92t\xc2\x85'
Monica	 No-no, it\xc2\x92s not okay! It\xc2\x92s not! I mean you were just\xc2\x85\nYou\xc2\x92re so incredible! You went through all this time and effort to make this tape for\nme! Y\xc2\x92know I\xc2\x92m just gonna\xc2\x97I, I am gonna make this up to you! I will! I-I am\ngoing to cook anything you want in here (points to the kitchen), and I am going to do\nanything you want in there! (Points to the bedroom.)'
Chandler	 (thinking it over) Well, I did put a lot of thought in the tape. (They\nboth run into the bedroom.)'

Chandler	 Wow! (To the sock bunny still on his hand.) You are way to\nyoung to have seen that!'
Monica	 Oops! (Covers its eyes.) Y\xc2\x92know, your birthday is in a\nmonth-and-a-half, what do you say I forget to get you a present for that too?'
Chandler	 You are totally and completely 100% forgiven.'
Monica	 We have got to wash that! (Referring to the sock bunny.)'
Chandler	 Yeah! (Takes it off his hand and throws it behind the night-stand.)'
Monica	 Do you remember that jacket that you love so much, that you thought was\ntoo expensive?'
Chandler	 You have done enough!'
Monica	 I wanna wake up early and go get it for you!'
Chandler	 No you don\xc2\x92t\xc2\x97get it in black, not brown.'
Monica	 Oop, your cake is ready!'
Chandler	 Oop!'
Chandler	 Well, it\xc2\x92s like that old saying, have some sex, eat some cake.'
Joey's Look-A-Like	 Hey Mon! Hey Chann! (He goes to the fridge) Just\ngettin\xc2\x92 a soda! (Does so.)"
Monica	 Who the hell are you?!'
Joey's Look-A-Like	 I\xc2\x92m Joey! How are you doin\xc2\x92?!"
Joey	 (entering) No! No! No! No! No! How you doin\xc2\x92?! How you\ndoin\xc2\x92\xc2\x97Damnit Carl! Go wait in the hall! (Goes into the hall.)'
Joey	 Look, I got to apologize on the behalf of Carl.'
Chandler	 Who the hell is Carl?!'
Joey	 Oh, did I not mention? Carl is a guy I hired to be my identical twin for a\nmedical research project.'
Chandler	 Y\xc2\x92know sometimes the good ideas are just right in front of you,\naren\xc2\x92t they?'
Joey	 Okay, I know it sounds crazy, but I think it might work. Y\xc2\x92know? The\nonly problem is, Carl\xc2\x92s acting is\xc2\x85 (Does the international hand symbol for\nso-so.)'
Monica	 The only problem!'
Joey	 Yeah, he\xc2\x92s the reason I didn\xc2\x92t get that big Minute Maid\ncommercial a couple of years ago remember? We were supposed to be brothers, but he messed\nit up.'
Carl	 (sticking his head back in) Hey, uh can I get a little piece of that cake?'
Joey	 (to Carl) Pizza!! We like Pizza!! Get out!!! (Carl does so.)'
Phoebe	 Pat Sajak?'
Rachel	 Yep!'
Phoebe	 Alex Trebek?'
Rachel	 Oh, of course!'
Phoebe	 Chuck Woolery?'
Rachel	 Definitely! Phoebe, you will not find a single game show host,\nwho\xc2\x92s ass I cannot kick.'
Rachel	 Say it!'
Phoebe	 Say we are unagi!'
Ross	 It\xc2\x92s not something you are! It\xc2\x92s something you have!'
Rachel	 Say it!'
Ross	 Y\xc2\x92know what? I can easily get out of this, but there is a chance you\ncan get very, very hurt!'
Joey	 All right Carl, we\xc2\x92re next. Now remember, what is not gonna be?'
Carl	 Another Minute Maid fiasco.'
Joey	 That\xc2\x92s right! And what are you not gonna do?'
Carl	 Well, I\xc2\x92m not gonna talk because\xc2\x85'
Joey	 (gets very angry) Damnit Carl! (Carl goes to say something more, and Joey\nsilences him with a grunt.)'
The Doctor	 (entering) (To the receptionist) Can I have the next one please?\n(Takes the form.) Joey and Tony Tribbiani. (Joey and Carl stand up.)'
Joey	 That\xc2\x92s us.'
The Doctor	 (seeing they\xc2\x92re not identical) But uh, this is a study for\nidentical twins.'
Joey	 That\xc2\x92s right, $2,000.'
The Doctor	 But, you\xc2\x92re not identical twins.'
Joey	 Damnit Carl!'
Chandler	 Oh my good God.'
Monica	 Hey! Continuing the countdown of your favorite meals. Tonight, No. 3,\nmacaroni and cheese with cut up hot dogs.'
Chandler	 Look, you have done enough! Okay? You have to stop this now.'
Monica	 I will! But not tonight. For dinner music, I thought we could listen to\nthat tape you made me.'
Chandler	 Oh, the mixed tape.'
Monica	 The Way You Look Tonight is on here! Dance with me?'
Monica	 You are just the sweetest. (They kiss.)'
Janice	 I love the way you look every night Chandler! (Monica breaks the\nkiss and Chandler freezes in terror.) That\xc2\x92s why I made you this tape! Happy\nBirthday! Love Janice!'
Chandler	 No! You\xc2\x92re the sweetest! (He tries to kiss her but Monica backs\naway with a look that could kill on her face.)'
The Instructor	 Okay ladies, that ends today\xc2\x92s class, and let\xc2\x92s\nremember, let\xc2\x92s be safe out there. '
Ross	 It\xc2\x92s a great class.'
The Instructor	 Thanks.'
Ross	 Yeah, yeah, I was watching. (The instructor just nods and walks away.)\nUmm, hey, a couple of questions though. Umm, about that-that-that last move where the\nwoman tripped you and then pinned you to the floor, what-what-what-what would you do next?'
The Instructor	 Well, she would take her keys and try to jam them\xc2\x85'
Ross	 No. No-no. No. What would you do next?'
The Instructor	 Who? Me the attacker?'
Ross	 Yes that\xc2\x92s right.'
The Instructor	 Why?'
Ross	 I tired attacking two women, did not work.'
The Instructor	 What?!'
Ross	 No, I mean it\xc2\x92s okay, I mean, they\xc2\x92re-they\xc2\x92re my friends.\nIn fact, I-I-I was married to one of them.'
The Instructor	 Let me get this straight man, you attacked your ex-wife?!'
Ross	 Oh, no! No-no! No, I tired! But I couldn\xc2\x92t. That\xc2\x92s why I\xc2\x92m\nhere. Maybe we could attack them together? (He glares at him.) That-that\xc2\x92s a no.'
Chandler	 I am so, so, so, so sorry!'
Monica	 (not buying it) Uh-huh.'
Chandler	 And I will cook anything you want in here (points to the kitchen), and\ndo anything in there! (Points to the bedroom.)'
Monica	 (pointing to the kitchen) Yeah you will! (Points to the bedroom) And,\nare you kiddin\xc2\x92 me?!'
Chandler	 Come on Monica, it\xc2\x92s our Valentine\xc2\x92s Day. Please?\nPlease-please, please?'
Monica	 Okay.'
Chandler	 Okay. (They hug.)'
Chandler	 So, are we going in there?'
Monica	 I am!! (Enter her room and closes the door behind her.)'

Ross	 Ah-ha, nowhere to run! (He starts to run towards them.)'
Rachel	 I don\xc2\x92t like sitting up here! I\xc2\x92m just gonna over\xc2\x85 (She\nstarts to get up.)'
Phoebe	 (stopping her) No Rachel! They got here first!'
Phoebe	 Why is Ross doing that?'
Ross	 DANGER!!!!'
Rachel	 Oh my God! Why is he jumping on those women!'
Phoebe	 We should help him!'
Rachel	 I\xc2\x85 Well, I don\xc2\x92t think they need any help.'
