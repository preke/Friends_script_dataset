Joey	 Hey! You guys! You\xc2\x92re not gonna believe this! I just got off the\nphone with my agent\xc2\x85'
Phoebe	 Oh my God! (Joey looks at her.) I\xc2\x92m sorry, too soon. You go.'
Joey	 Okay. I got nominated for my part on Days of Our Lives!'
Monica	 Joey!'
Phoebe	 Good for you!'
Monica	 Congratulations! Wow! I can\xc2\x92t believe you\xc2\x92re nominated for an Emmy!'
Joey	 No-no.'
Monica	 Oh Soap Opera Digest award!'
Joey	 No! I\xc2\x92m up for a Soapie!'
Monica	 Honey? Is that something you\xc2\x92re making up?'
Joey	 No, no, no! It\xc2\x92s real! And it has been since 1998. (Rachel returns\nfrom the bathroom.) Hey Rach! Rach! I\xc2\x92m up for a Soapie!'
Rachel	 (gasps) Oh my God! Oh my God!! That is like the third most prestigious\nsoap opera award there is!'
Joey	 Thank you! Well, I guess now I know who I\xc2\x92m taking to the awards.\n(Points to Rachel.)'
Rachel	 Oh, stop that! Don\xc2\x92t kid about that! (Gasps) Will all the stars be\nthere?'
Joey	 Many are scheduled to appear.'
Rachel	 Oh my God! Oh my God! I can\xc2\x92t go! I\xc2\x92m gonna be too nervous!'
Monica	 (to Joey) Okay, I\xc2\x92ll go!'
Rachel	 No!! You are getting married! This is all I have.'

Ross	 \xc2\x85and it was Ernst Muhlbrat who first hypothesized that the\nVelociraptor would expand it\xc2\x92s collar and emit a high pitched noise to frighten\nit\xc2\x92s predator. (A student raises his hand.) Yes Mr. Lewis? '
Lewis	 What kinda noise?'
Ross	 Just a high pitched intimidating noise.'
Lewis	 But like how?'
Ross	 Well we-we don\xc2\x92t know for sure. But in my head it-it sounded\nsomething like this. (He makes a high pitched noise and Alan doesn\xc2\x92t know what to\nmake of it.) Of course, this is just conjecture. Okay, that\xc2\x92s uh, that\xc2\x92s all for\ntoday. (Everyone starts to get up.) Uh Mr. Morse, can I see you for a moment? '
Morse	 Yes sir.'
Ross	 Mr. Morse I need to talk to you about your mid-term exam, I\xc2\x92m afraid\nI-I had to fail you.'
Morse	 (shocked) Why?!'
Ross	 Well you need 60% to pass\xc2\x85'
Morse	 What\xc2\x92d I get?'
Ross	 Seven.'
Morse	 That\xc2\x92s not so good.'
Ross	 No-no it\xc2\x92s not. What-what happened there Ned?'
Morse	 Well maybe you can cut me some slack. I\xc2\x92m sort of in love.'
Ross	 Well I\xc2\x92m sorry but, that-that\xc2\x92s really not my problem.'
Morse	 I\xc2\x92m in love with you.'
Ross	 Well that brings me in the loop a little.'
Morse	 You see, that\xc2\x92s why I did so bad on this test. I\xc2\x92m having a\nhard time concentrating. When you\xc2\x92re up there (Points to the podium) and you\xc2\x92re\nteaching and your face gets all serious\xc2\x85you look so good. (In a sexy voice) You wear\nthat tight little turtleneck sweater\xc2\x85'
Ross	 Okay! (Walks away from him.) Umm, I uh, I\xc2\x92m your teacher. I\xc2\x92m\nsorry, you\xc2\x92re-you\xc2\x92re a student and I-and I like women. In spite of what may be\nwritten on the backs of some of these chairs.'
Phoebe	 Oh my God! That guy at the counter is totally checking you out!'
Monica	 Really? (Looks.) My God, he\xc2\x92s really cute.'
Phoebe	 Go for it.'
Monica	 Phoebe, I\xc2\x92m engaged!'
Phoebe	 I\xc2\x92m just saying, get his number just in case. But no Chandler is in\nan accident and can\xc2\x92t perform sexually and he would want you to take a lover to\nsatisfy the needs that he can no longer fulfill.'
Monica	 Op, can I just tell you something? Very flattered but umm, I\xc2\x92m\nengaged. (Points to her ring.)'
Monica	 Well you should be embarrassed. (Leaves.)'
Phoebe	 I did, but that was really fun.'
Joey	 (pretending to be an announcer) And the winner is\xc2\x85Joey Tribbiani! (He\nthen gets excited and goes over to the counter to practice his acceptance speech using a\nbottle of maple syrup as the award.) Oh\xc2\x85 Wow! I honestly never expected this. I uh, I\ndidn\xc2\x92t prepare a speech. But umm, I\xc2\x92d like to thank (Rachel enters quietly) my\nparents, who\xc2\x92ve always been there for me. I\xc2\x92d also like to thank my friends,\nChandler, Monica, Phoebe, Rachel\xc2\x85'
Rachel	 I\xc2\x92m fourth! (Joey is startled.) Look at you with your little maple\nsyrup award!'
Joey	 Yeah may-maybe you don\xc2\x92t tell anyone about this.'
Rachel	 What? No! It\xc2\x92s not a big deal! I do that too, with my shampoo\nbottle.'
Joey	 Really?'
Rachel	 Yeah.'
Joey	 What award are you practicing for?'
Rachel	 Grammy, Best New Artist.'
Joey	 Oh, hey listen! The Soapie\xc2\x92s called today and I also get to present\nan award.'
Rachel	 Ohh that\xc2\x92s great!'
Joey	 Yeah!'
Rachel	 So you\xc2\x92ll definitely get onstage, even if you don\xc2\x92t win.'
Joey	 (confused) What you-you don\xc2\x92t think I\xc2\x92m gonna win?'
Rachel	 Well of course I do! But y\xc2\x92know, favorite returning character is a\ntough category Joey. I mean you\xc2\x92re up against the guy who survived his own cremation.'
Joey	 Yeah. No-no I-I know I might not win, but it\xc2\x92s just\xc2\x85I\xc2\x92ve\nnever even been nominated before! I want it so much.'
Rachel	 Well Joey, you\xc2\x92ll probably get it. But you should probably\nyour-your gracious loser face. Y\xc2\x92know when like the cameras are on you and you wanna\nlook disappointed but also that your colleague deserved to win. Y\xc2\x92know? So it\xc2\x92s\nsorta like\xc2\x85 (Does it, you\xc2\x92ll have to see it.)'
Joey	 Hey! (Likes it.)'
Rachel	 Y\xc2\x92know?'
Joey	 You practice losing the Grammies too?'
Rachel	 Oh no, at the Grammies I always win.'
Joey	 Ah.'
Phoebe	 Oh hey!'
Monica	 Hey! How\xc2\x92d your date go with Jake?'
Phoebe	 Oh, great! We couldn\xc2\x92t keep our eyes off each other all night and\nthen every once and a while y\xc2\x92know, he\xc2\x92d kinda lean over and stroke my hair and\ntouch my neck. (Does that to Monica.)'
Monica	 Okay, stop it Phoebe, you\xc2\x92re getting me all tingly.'
Phoebe	 (laughs) All I could think of was y\xc2\x92know, "Is he gonna kiss\nme? Is he gonna kiss me?"'
Monica	 And did he?'
Phoebe	 I\xc2\x92m a lady Monica, I don\xc2\x92t kiss and tell. But this hickey\nspeaks for itself. (She starts to open up her blouse.)'
Monica	 Okay-okay, I got it. I got it.'
Phoebe	 I just like him so much that I just feel like I\xc2\x92ve had 10 drinks\ntoday and I\xc2\x92ve only had six.'
Monica	 Oh, I haven\xc2\x92t had that feeling since I first started going out with\nChandler. Wow, I\xc2\x92m never gonna have that feeling again am I?'
Phoebe	 You sound like a guy.'
Monica	 No, a guy would be saying, "I\xc2\x92m never gonna get to sleep with\nanyone else." Oh my God! I\xc2\x92m never gonna get to sleep with anyone else!\nI\xc2\x92ve been so busy planning the wedding that I forgot about all the things that\nI\xc2\x92d be giving up! I mean, I\xc2\x85I\xc2\x92m never gonna have a first kiss again.'
Phoebe	 You\xc2\x92ll have a last kiss.'
Ross	 Can I ask you something? Have you ever had a guy have a crush on you?'
Joey	 Is that why you wanted to tie my tie?'
Ross	 There\xc2\x92s this kid in my class who said he\xc2\x92s in love with me.'
Joey	 Whoa!'
Rachel	 (entering from her room) Whoa what?'
Joey	 Ross has a boyfriend.'
Ross	 I do-I do not have a boyfriend. There\xc2\x92s a guy in one of my\nclasses who-who has a crush on me.'
Rachel	 Really?'
Ross	 Yeah! I don\xc2\x92t know. I mean, last year Elizabeth now-now this kid.\nWhat-what-what-what is it?! Am I giving out some kind of\xc2\x85sexy professor vibe? (Rachel\nand Joey both look at him.)'
Rachel	 Not right now.'
Ross	 It-it\xc2\x97The point is my natural charisma has made him fail his midterm.'
Rachel	 Oh, see now I feel bad for the kid! I had a crush on a teacher once and\nit was so hard! Y\xc2\x92know you\xc2\x97I couldn\xc2\x92t concentrate and I blushed every time\nhe looked at me. I mean come on, you remember what\xc2\x92s it\xc2\x92s like to be 19 and in\nlove.'
Ross	 Yeah. I guess I can cut him some slack.'
Rachel	 Yeah.'
Joey	 How\xc2\x92d you get over that teacher?'
Rachel	 I didn\xc2\x92t. I got under him.'
Joey	 (To Ross) Problem solved.'
Jake	 Bye Phoebe.'
Phoebe	 Okay bye. (They kiss.)'
Jake	 All right. Bye. (Backs out the door.)'
Phoebe	 Bye! (Phoebe goes over and joins Monica on the couch.) We said good-bye\nat the door so as not to flaunt our new love.'
Monica	 Phoebe, it\xc2\x92s okay. You don\xc2\x92t have to tip toe around me.\nI-I\xc2\x92ve been thinking about it and umm, y\xc2\x92know what? I\xc2\x92m okay about not\nhaving that new relationship feeling\xc2\x85'
Jake	 (yelling through the window to Phoebe) I miss you already!!'
Phoebe	 (yelling back) I miss you too!!!! (He walks away.)'
Monica	 See? That\xc2\x92s what I mean. I mean that, that\xc2\x92s great! But\nI wouldn\xc2\x92t trade in what I have for that. I mean I\xc2\x92m gonna be with Chandler for\nthe rest of my life, and that\xc2\x92s what makes me happy. (Chandler approaches.) Hey\nsweetie, come here! Come sit down. Hey Phoebe and I were just talking about how our\nrelationship is deep and meaningful. It really is don\xc2\x92t you think?'
Chandler	 Oh totally! (Holds up his finger.) Pull my finger.'
Joey	 (To Rachel) This is it! This is my category.'
Rachel	 I know! My God! Do you have your speech?'
Joey	 Yeah, I got my speech!'
Rachel	 Do you got your gracious loser face?'
Joey	 Yeah. (Does it.)'
Rachel	 Now Joey remember, if you win you have to hug me! You hug me!'
Joey	 Okay. Can I squeeze your ass?'
Rachel	 On TV?! Yeah!'
Joey	 \xc2\x91Kay! '
The Presenter	 \xc2\x85in the category of Favorite Returning Male Character the\nnominees are
Joey	 What the?! (Joey pounds the table and starts yelling at Rachel, and which\nis drowned out by applause. Rachel is desperately trying to tell Joey that he\xc2\x92s on TV\nright now. He finally notices and he does his gracious loser face.)'

Joey	 (angrily and monotone) Any one of the brilliant actresses nominated for\nthis award tonight deserves to take it home. Unfortunately only one can. (Shakes his head\nin disgust.) The nominees for Best Supporting Actress are from Passions Erin Goff.\n(There is applause, which Joey disgustedly waits to dye out.) From One Life to Live\nMary Loren Bishop (They start to applaud again, but Joey interrupts in with the rest of\nthe nominees), from All My Children Sarah Mchann, and from Days of Our Lives\nJessica Ashley. And the winner is\xc2\x85(Opens the envelope)\xc2\x85Jessica Ashley from Days\nof Our Lives. (Applause) Uh, unfortunately Jessica couldn\xc2\x92t be with us tonight so\nI\xc2\x92ll be accepting this award on her behalf. (Realizes something) And I\xc2\x92m sure\nthat Jessica would like to thank my parents who always believed in me. She\xc2\x92d also\nlike to thank my friends, Chandler, Monica, Ross, Phoebe, and Rachel who\xc2\x92s\nsittin\xc2\x92 right there! (Points at Rachel.) (The music starts and his microphone is\nturned off, this angers Joey again and he disgustedly exits.)'
Rachel	 Joey! Why did we have to rush out of there so fast?!'
Joey	 Rach we had to get out of there because, look what I won! (He whips out\nthe award for Best Supporting Actress that he accepted for Jessica.)'
Rachel	 Oh my God you stole her award!'
Joey	 No-no! No, I\xc2\x92m accepting it on her behalf. (He puts it up above the\nTV to display it.)'
Rachel	 Joey I don\xc2\x92t think you know what behalf means.'
Joey	 Sure I do! It\xc2\x92s a verb! As in, "I behalfin\xc2\x92 it!"'
Rachel	 Joey, you have got to take this back!'
Joey	 But why?! I should\xc2\x92ve won one and I really want it and she\ndidn\xc2\x92t even care enough to come to the thing! It could also be a Grammy.'
Rachel	 (looking at the award) No! Joey!'
Joey	 Come on Rach! No one saw me take it! There was a whole table full of\n\xc2\x91em.'
Rachel	 Do you really want an award you didn\xc2\x92t win?'
Joey	 No! I want an award I did win! But nobody\xc2\x92s giving me any of those!\nPlus\xc2\x97Hey Rach, if-if I put it up there (Points to the TV) right? When people come\nover they\xc2\x92ll see it and they\xc2\x92ll think I won it.'
Rachel	 Joey is says Best Supporting Actress!'
Joey	 I can scratch that right off.'
Rachel	 Joey no, this is wrong! You have to take it back, okay? You don\xc2\x92t\nwant to win an award this way. You\xc2\x92re very talented. And someday you\xc2\x92re gonna\nwin one of these for real and that one is gonna mean something.'
Joey	 All right!'
Rachel	 All right? (He sets the award down.) Thank you.'
Joey	 I\xc2\x92ll take it back tomorrow.'
Rachel	 Thank you.'
Joey	 (opening his door) If I can\xc2\x92t have it you can\xc2\x92t have it! (Rachel\nwalks away angrily.)'
Lewis	 Professor Geller?'
Ross	 (turning towards him) Yes Mr. Lewis, how can I help you?'
Lewis	 I know I didn\xc2\x92t do well on my midterms and stuff but, I was kinda\nhoping you could change my grade.'
Ross	 And why exactly would I do that? (Goes back to writing on the board.)'
Lewis	 Because I\xc2\x92m in love with you.'
Ross	 (turning around and dragging the chalk down the board) What?!'
Lewis	 Yeah, I\xc2\x92m all\xc2\x85in love with you and stuff. So could you change\nmy grade?'
Ross	 No!'
Lewis	 Well why not you changed Ned\xc2\x92s grade!'
Ross	 Well that\xc2\x92s different! Okay? Because he, he was actually in love with\nme!'
Lewis	 No he\xc2\x92s not! He\xc2\x92s totally yanking your chain! He\xc2\x92s done\nthis with three other teachers!'
Ross	 What?'
Lewis	 He\xc2\x92s got a girlfriend!'
Ross	 I can\xc2\x92t believe someone would do that for a grade.'
Lewis	 I know! It\xc2\x92s awful. I love you.'
Monica	 Have you seen Chandler?'
Phoebe	 No. Why?'
Monica	 \xc2\x91Cause I just keeping thinking about all these things that I\xc2\x92m\nnot gonna have and it\xc2\x92s freaking me out. I don\xc2\x92t know what to do about it.'
Phoebe	 Okay, don\xc2\x92t sweat it. (Looking around her.) Chandler is nowhere\naround so go ahead get it out of your system. That guy\xc2\x92s cute. (Points to a guy\nsitting behind Monica.)'
Monica	 Phoebe! Come on I\xc2\x92m serious! I just got to talk to him about all\nthis.'
Phoebe	 No that is the last thing you want to do!'
Monica	 Why?'
Phoebe	 Because you\xc2\x92re marrying him!'
Monica	 You gotta help me out here Pheebs.'
Phoebe	 All right, I\xc2\x92ve never been engaged and I\xc2\x92ve never really been\nmarried, but I can only tell you what my mother told me. Whenever you have doubts or fears\nor anxieties about a relationship, do not communicate them to your husband.'
Monica	 So I\xc2\x92m not supposed to share my doubts and fears with the guy\nI\xc2\x92m gonna spend the rest of my life with?'
Phoebe	 That is correct! Yes, you\xc2\x92re supposed to take all of that stuff and\nput it in a little box in your mind and then lock it up tight.'
Monica	 Your mother told you this?'
Phoebe	 Yes!'
Monica	 The woman that got married a bunch of times and killed herself when you\nwere 13?'
Phoebe	 Oh my God! You\xc2\x92re right! Go! (Monica starts to leave.) Go tell\nChandler! Hurry before it\xc2\x92s too late! Wait no! (Monica stops.) Does this also mean\nputting out doesn\xc2\x92t get you love? (Monica is shocked.)'
Rachel	 I cannot believe I\xc2\x92m gonna meet Jessica Ashley!'
Joey	 Okay wait-wait p-please be cool! Okay? I work with this woman.'
Rachel	 Okay, I\xc2\x92m totally cool! (She coolly knocks on the door)'
Jessica Ashley	 Come in.'
Joey	 Hey Jessica.'
Rachel	 (coolly) Hey Jess.'
Joey	 Ah, this is my friend Rachel.'
Jessica Ashley	 Hi.'
Rachel	 \xc2\x91Sup? (Joey glares at her.)'
Joey	 Uh listen, here\xc2\x92s your Soapie. I accepted it for ya. (Hands it to\nher.)'
Jessica Ashley	 (shocked) Oh my God! I won! Do you have any idea what this\nmeans?! (She rolls her eyes and throws it onto the couch.)'
Joey	 Well, that-that-that\xc2\x92s it? You\xc2\x92re gonna, you\xc2\x92re gonna put\nit on your self or anything?'
Jessica Ashley	 No, I try to save that for real awards. Now, if you\xc2\x92ll\nexcuse me. (She exits.)'
Joey	 (To Rachel) Take it back?'
Rachel	 Absolutely.'
Joey	 Y-y-yeah! (As they start to leave, Rachel pauses and steals a vase with\nflowers in it.) Yeah you do. (They exit.)'
Monica	 Honey, as we get closer to the wedding, is there anything that you would\nlike to talk about or share?'
Chandler	 Okay. Well, I think the centerpieces are too big'
Monica	 You\xc2\x92re wrong! The centerpieces are fine! Do you ever get scared at\nall?'
Chandler	 Kinda. They\xc2\x92re really big.'
Monica	 Doesn\xc2\x92t it ever just freak you out that-that you\xc2\x92re never\ngonna be with anybody new again?'
Chandler	 What?'
Monica	 Just, I love you so much. Just\xc2\x85It\xc2\x92s just sometimes it bothers\nme that I\xc2\x92m never gonna have that feeling. Y\xc2\x92know when you meet someone for the\nfirst time and it\xc2\x92s new and exciting? Y\xc2\x92know that rush?'
Chandler	 No. No, see when I first meet somebody it\xc2\x92s uh it\xc2\x92s mostly\npanic, anxiety, and a great deal of sweating.'
Monica	 Okay, but all right you\xc2\x92re a guy, does it not freak you that\nyou\xc2\x92re never gonna sleep with anybody else?'
Chandler	 Sleeping with somebody new, anxiety, panic, and I\xc2\x92m afraid even\nmore sweating.'
Monica	 Even with me?'
Chandler	 I was dangerously dehydrated during the first six months of our\nrelationship. (Monica laughs.) Look, for me the rush is knowing that we are gonna be\ntogether for the rest of our lives.'
Monica	 Really?'
Chandler	 Well yeah! But now that I know that you\xc2\x92re having these thoughts,\nI\xc2\x92m back to panic, anxiety, and uh I\xc2\x92m definitely gonna need some kind of sports\ndrink.'
Monica	 Come here! Come here! (They hug.) Sweetie you don\xc2\x92t have to worry.\nNo, besides y\xc2\x92know what? I\xc2\x92m gonna have a lot of new things with you. The first\ntime we buy a house. Our first kid. Our first grandkid\xc2\x85'
Chandler	 (hoarsely) Water! Water! Water!'
Ross	 Uh Mr. Morse, can I speak to you for a moment?'
Morse	 (walking up) That was a great lecture today. Did you get a little hair\ncut?'
Ross	 Uh-hmm, yeah-yeah do you like it? Do-do you looove it? I just want you to\nknow that I\xc2\x92m changing your grade back.'
Morse	 What?! Why?'
Ross	 \xc2\x91Cause I know what you\xc2\x92re trying to pull here. Okay? It\xc2\x92s\nnot gonna work.'
Morse	 I\xc2\x92m not trying to pull anything. Look I love you dude.'
Ross	 Y\xc2\x92know what? I-I\xc2\x92m not even gonna talk about this. Okay? This\nlittle thing is over. I know you have a girlfriend! Okay\xc2\x97(Ned looks\nshocked)\xc2\x97Yeah! And I know about the other professors! How do you think that makes me\nfeel Ned?! You used me! You don\xc2\x92t love me and you never did! (Ross turns around to\nmake a grand exit but runs into two colleagues.) Ah Professor Winston, Professor\nFredrickson, I\xc2\x92ll be right with you. (To Ned) Don\xc2\x92t make this worse and\nI\xc2\x92ll give you a C. (To the professors) Shall we? (They leave.)'

Phoebe	 Rach? '
Rachel	 I\xc2\x92ll be out in a second.'
Phoebe	 Oh. (Picks it up.) It\xc2\x92s just so unexpected! I\xc2\x85I uh\xc2\x85Boy\nI\xc2\x92ll tell you it\xc2\x92s just such an honor to be nominated for a Nobel Prize\nand y\xc2\x92know to win one for a massage. Especially after having just won a Tony\naward for best actress in\xc2\x85'
