Chandler	 (entering in a bathrobe) I just walked in the bathroom and saw Kathy\nnaked! It was like torture!'
Ross	 Y'know if we ever go to war and you\xc2\x92re captured, you\xc2\x92re in for a\nbig surprise."
Chandler	 It just keeps getting worse and worse! Y'know? I mean it\xc2\x92s bad\nenough that I\xc2\x92m in love with my roommates girlfriend\xc2\x97which by the way, I think\nshe knows. Because every time we\xc2\x92re in the room together there\xc2\x92s this weird like\nenergy between us. And call me crazy, but I think she likes me too. And now I have seen\nher naked. I mean at least when I\xc2\x92ve seen her with clothes on, I could imagine her\nbody was like covered in boles or something. But there are no boles, she\xc2\x92s smooth!\nSmooth! (leaves)"
Phoebe	 Wow! Could everyone totally see up his robe?'
All	 Yeah! Oh my God!'

Casey	 Here you go.'
Joey	 Great! All right, so I\xc2\x92ll call you later.'
Casey	 Great! (leaves)'
Chandler	 (rushing up) Hey-Hey-Hey! Who was that?'
Joey	 That would be Casey. We\xc2\x92re going out tonight.'
Chandler	 Goin\xc2\x92 out, huh? Wow! Wow! (Does a little celebration dance) So\nthings didn\xc2\x92t work out with Kathy, huh? Bummer.'
Joey	 No, things are fine with Kathy. I\xc2\x92m having a late dinner with her\ntonight, right after my early dinner with Casey.'
Chandler	 (shocked) What?'
Joey	 Yeah-yeah. And the craziest thing is that I just ate a whole pizza by\nmyself! (Laughs)'
Chandler	 Wait! You\xc2\x92re going out with Kathy!'
Joey	 Yeah. Why are you getting so upset?'
Chandler	 Well, I\xc2\x92m upset\xc2\x97for you. I mean, having sex with an endless\nline of beautiful women must be very unfulfilling for you. (He can\xc2\x92t believe he just\nsad that.)'
Joey	 What is the big deal? It\xc2\x92s not like we\xc2\x92re exclusive.'
Chandler	 Look, Joey, Kathy is clearly not fulfilling your emotional needs. But\nCasey, I mean granted I only saw the back of her head, but I got this sense that\nshe\xc2\x92s-she\xc2\x92s smart, and funny, and gets you.'
Joey	 You got all that from the back of her head?'
Chandler	 All right look, I think it\xc2\x92s time for you to settle down. Y'know?\nMake a choice, pick a lane."
Joey	 Who\xc2\x92s Elaine?'
Phoebe	 (singing) "Little, tiny Tarzan, swinging on a nose hair.\nSwinging with the greatest of ease\xc2\x85" Darn it! Now, I don\xc2\x92t know who to\nget to the next verse.'
Ross	 Oh, you could just go uh, "greatest of ease\xc2\x85 (plays air\nguitar) BAH-bah-bha-bhannn." Then go right into it.'
Phoebe	 Yeah, ooh, I like that! Yeah. Wait! How do you know about\n\xc2\x91bah-bah-bha-bhan?\xc2\x92'
Ross	 Well umm, y\xc2\x92know, I used to play.'
Phoebe	 Oh yeah, that\xc2\x92s right, the keyboards, huh?'
Ross	 Yeah, just a little in high school, but then I really got into it in\ncollege. I mean that\xc2\x92s-that\xc2\x92s when I really found my sound.'
Monica	 Oh God! Orange juice just came out of my nose, but it was totally worth\nit. Oh my God, I completely forgot about your sound.'
Ross	 Yeah.'
Monica	 He used to lock himself in the basement for hours. No one was every\nallowed to hear, "The Sound."'
Phoebe	 I wanna hear "The Sound."'
Ross	 Really? No. I mean, nah, I haven\xc2\x92t played in so long, and-and, well\nit\xc2\x92s-it\xc2\x92s really personal stuff, y\xc2\x92know?'
Phoebe	 Come on, play that funky music white boy.'
Monica	 Yeah!'
Ross	 No, you guys, I mean my keyboards are all the way up in\xc2\x97No, yeah,\nokay. (Runs out.)'
Ross	 Okay, guys.'
Chandler	 All right! Bring it on, you\xc2\x85'
Ross	 Here we go. (Plays one note) Y\xc2\x92know, I\xc2\x92ve-I\xc2\x92ve never played\nmy stuff for anyone before, so it\xc2\x92s important that-that you understand it\xc2\x92s\nabout communicating very private emotions. (Plays another note) Y\xc2\x92know, umm, you\nshould-you should think of umm, my work as wordless sound poems. That\xc2\x92s what\nI\xc2\x92m\xc2\x85'
Chandler	 (interrupting) Oh my God! Play!'
Monica	 (At a loss for words) Boy, that was-that was, umm\xc2\x85 terrific.'
Chandler	 Really, bitchin\xc2\x92!'
Phoebe	 Wow, it was so\xc2\x97wow!'
Ross	 Really?! I mean, really?!!'
Rachel	 Yeah, I mean, you should play in public!'
Ross	 Wow! Thanks, you guys. That\xc2\x92s uh\xc2\x97ohhh, I wanna, I wanna play you\nanother piece! Umm! Uh-oh! I left my uh, helicopter sounds on another disk. I\xc2\x92ll be\nright back! Okay? (Runs to fetch them) This is so nice, I\xc2\x92m\xc2\x97I am so\xc2\x85\n(starts to break up and leaves)'
Monica	 Oh God bless my dad sound proofing the basement!'
Rachel	 Oh, I can\xc2\x92t believe I ever let him touch me with those fingers.'
Phoebe	 What are you guys talking about, I loved it! It was soo moving. Oh, plus\nit\xc2\x92s just, it\xc2\x92s so different from the stuff you usually hear.'
Chandler	 You mean like, music?'
Chandler	 Yeah, I know what you\xc2\x92re thinkin\xc2\x92! Yes, yes, your breasts\nare just as firm and juicy.'
Chandler	 Come in!'
Kathy	 (entering) Hey! (sees what\xc2\x92s on TV) Oh God, is that Baywatch?'
Chandler	 Uh yes, but uh, I just watch it for the articles.'
Kathy	 So is Joey around?'
Chandler	 No-no, he\xc2\x92s not back yet, but he\xc2\x92ll be here any minute. So\nuh, come on in. Have a seat. Bow or stern?'
Kathy	 I uh, don\xc2\x92t really have a preference. You?'
Chandler	 I like it in the stern. (Realizes what he just said.) \xc2\x85of the\nboat. (The phone rings, and he answers it.) (on phone) Hello.'
Joey	 (on the other end at a pay phone) Hey, it\xc2\x92s me. Listen Casey and I\nwere on our way back and had a little car trouble.'
Chandler	 What happened?'
Joey	 We broke down on the Parkway, so I have to walk back and get some\ntransmission fluid. And hey, listen could you please tell Kathy that I\xc2\x92ll be there as\nsoon as I can.'
Chandler	 Why can\xc2\x92t you tell her?'
Joey	 \xc2\x91Cause I only have one quarter, and I think my time is about\nto\xc2\x97(he stops talking suddenly)'
Chandler	 Joey! Joey!!'
Joey	 Yeah?'
Chandler	 I thought your time ran out.'
Joey	 Me too, but I guess I do have a couple of more\xc2\x97(his time runs out for\nreal)'
Chandler	 (to Kathy) Uhh, that was Joey. He\xc2\x92s running a little late, he\nsays he\xc2\x92s sorry.'
Kathy	 Oh.'
Chandler	 So I guess it\xc2\x92s just uh, you and me then.'
Kathy	 Oh, okay.'
Chandler	 Yeah, I think it is!'
Kathy	 So what did you do today?'
Chandler	 Oh, I had an appointment to get my haircut\xc2\x85'
Kathy	 (interrupting) Oh, it looks great!'
Chandler	 \xc2\x85and then it got canceled.'
Kathy	 Well, I could cut it.'
Chandler	 Really?! You do that?'
Kathy	 Yeah, I do. Of course, I learned at my aunt\xc2\x92s dog grooming shop, but\nhey, what do you say?'
Chandler	 Dog grooming huh? Okay, just don\xc2\x92t make my tail too poofy.'
Kathy	 You have really great hair.'
Chandler	 Well, thanks. I grow it myself. (Kathy is running her fingers through\nhis hair, and Chandler catches himself enjoying it too much.) Y\xc2\x92know who also has\ngreat hair is Joey!'
Kathy	 Yes! Yeah! Joey has great hair! Umm, I\xc2\x92m basically done here. Just\nlet me get this off your neck.'
Chandler	 What-what \xc2\x91cha doin\xc2\x92?'
Kathy	 Checking to see if it\xc2\x92s even.'
Chandler	 \xc2\x91Kay.'
Kathy	 Looks good.'
Chandler	 (jumping up to answer the phone) Oh the phone! The phone\xc2\x92s making\nsounds! (On phone) Hello!'
Joey	 (on phone) Hey dude, it\xc2\x92s me.'
Chandler	 Hey it\xc2\x92s Joey!'
Joey	 Listen uh, I\xc2\x92m really sorry, it looks like I\xc2\x92m gonna be stuck\nhere for a while. I got the transmission fluid, but when I went to put it in the car, the\ntransmission wasn\xc2\x92t there!'
Chandler	 What?'
Joey	 Yeah, it must\xc2\x92ve fallen out a few blocks back. I just figured we hit\na dog.'
Chandler	 Okay.'
Joey	 Listen uh, could you put Kathy on, I wanna apologize.'
Chandler	 Oh yeah man. (to Kathy) Joey. (Hands her the phone.)'
Kathy	 (on phone) Hey. (listens) Oh no it\xc2\x92s fine, don\xc2\x92t worry about\nit. (listens) Yeah-no, stop apologizing, it\xc2\x92s okay. (listens) Yeah! I\xc2\x92ll talk to\nyou tomorrow. (hangs up) (to Chandler) I should uh, probably go.'
Chandler	 Yeah. Yes! Yeah. '
Kathy	 I forgot my purse.'
Chandler	 Oh. '
Kathy	 No, I really did forget my purse.'

Chandler	 No-no-no-no, this is bad! It\xc2\x92s bad! This is bad!'
Kathy	 Horrible!'
Chandler	 Wait the uh, the kiss or the situation?'
Kathy	 No-no-no, the kiss was good.'
Chandler	 Okay!'
Kathy	 No, but that\xc2\x92s bad!'
Chandler	 Ooh! Yes! Okay! Here\xc2\x92s what we do, we-we forget it happened.'
Kathy	 What?!'
Chandler	 Okay, we-we swallow our feelings. Even if it means we\xc2\x92re unhappy\nforever. Sound good?'
Kathy	 Can you really do that?'
Chandler	 I have to; he\xc2\x92s my best friend, and you\xc2\x92re seeing him.'
Kathy	 Chandler, I like Joey a lot, but with you\xc2\x85'
Chandler	 (interrupting) Oh-no-no-no! Don\xc2\x92t! Don\xc2\x92t! See-see,\nyou\xc2\x92re getting me confused, I\xc2\x92m starting to urn. '
Kathy	 I\xc2\x92m sorry. If you wanna pretend that nothing happened, I can try.'
Chandler	 I-I think we have too.'
Kathy	 Okay. Bye.'
Chandler	 Bye. (Kathy leaves and Chandler wonders over to and leans up against\nthe door.) Are you still out there?'
Kathy	 (outside the door) No. (Chandler opens the door and they kiss again.)'
Ross	 (His voice is altered to sound like a computer.) Electrifying. (He plays\nthe sound of a ticking clock.) Emphatic time-time-time\xc2\x85'
Monica	 (to Rachel and Phoebe) Y'know, there\xc2\x92s a Starbucks about\nthree blocks down."
Phoebe	 (pushing Monica back onto the couch) It\xc2\x92s so inspired! Look at him!\nLook at him go!'
Ross	 (with the altered voice) Thank you guys-guys-guys\xc2\x85'
Monica	 (to Phoebe) Hey, aren\xc2\x92t you up next?'
Phoebe	 Oh no, I\xc2\x92m not playing tonight.'
Rachel	 Why not?'
Phoebe	 I can\xc2\x92t follow Ross! It\xc2\x92d be like those bicycle ridding chimps\nthat followed The Beetles. No.'
Monica	 Phoebe, Ross sucks! '
Rachel	 Phoebe, the place has emptied because of him.'
Phoebe	 Oh my God, he\xc2\x92s not even appreciated in his own time. I would give\nanything to not be appreciated in my own time!'
Monica	 Okay. Umm, Phoebe, you suck too.'
Rachel	 Yeah, Phoebe you\xc2\x92re\xc2\x85 awful!'
Phoebe	 You guys. You suck too. (She hugs them both.)'
Joey	 Aww man! I can\xc2\x92t believe I locked myself out again! (He knocks on the\ndoor.)'
Chandler	 Hang on buddy! (He goes over and unlocks the door and opens it to\nreveal a fully furnished apartment.)'
Joey	 (rushing in) Oh my God! What happened here? Did you do all this?'
Chandler	 I sure did.'
Joey	 Why?'
Chandler	 Well, I just thought it\xc2\x92d make me feel good to do something nice\nfor my friend.'
Joey	 Well, you\xc2\x92re amazing.'
Chandler	 Oh no-no-no. This is amazing. (He goes over and\npresses a button on a remote control that opens the entertainment center doors revealing\nthe TV.)'
Joey	 (very excited) A TV as if it appears from nowhere! That\xc2\x92s the dream!\nMan, how did you afford this stuff?'
Chandler	 Well, y\xc2\x92know I\xc2\x92m 29. I mean who needs a savings account.'
Joey	 Oh, you are the best friends anyone has ever had.'
Chandler	 Oh, I don\xc2\x92t know.'
Joey	 Oh-no-no-no, you are! You do this, you give me the great advice, and hey\nlisten, I was thinking about what you said yesterday about focusing on one woman, I\xc2\x92m\ngonna do that.'
Chandler	 You mean with Casey.'
Joey	 No-no-no, I think I\xc2\x92m gonna see how things go with Kathy. She\xc2\x92s\npretty cool.'
Chandler	 Or Casey.'
Joey	 No-no, Kathy.'
Chandler	 Could be Casey.'
Joey	 No. No, Kathy.'
Chandler	 Consider Casey.'
Joey	 Y\xc2\x92know what I think? I think somebody\xc2\x92s got a little crush on\nCasey. How \xc2\x91bout I fix you two up? What do you think?'
Chandler	 That all the pieces of my life are falling right into place!'
Ross	 (to Phoebe) Hey!'
Phoebe	 Hey! You were really great! You were really, really great!'
Ross	 Oh, thanks, thanks. So Monica tells me that uh, you don\xc2\x92t want to\nplay anymore because me and y'know my talent. Is that true?"
Phoebe	 Well, kinda. Yeah. Yeah.'
Ross	 Pheebs\xc2\x85'
Phoebe	 Yeah, I-I can\xc2\x92t\xc2\x97I mean y\xc2\x92know I was trying to be really\ny'know okay and upbeat about it, I just\xc2\x97I feel so dwarfed by your musical gift.\nI\xc2\x85"
Ross	 See but, Pheebs that-that is the exact opposite intent of my music.\nY\xc2\x92know my music is-is meant to inspire, and if it bothers you this much, then I\xc2\x85\nI won\xc2\x92t play anymore.'
Phoebe	 Oh no. No-no-no, don\xc2\x92t do that! How could I live with myself if I\nknew I was depriving the world of your music.'
Ross	 Yeah, okay.'
Ross	 Hey Chandler! Saw the new furniture. Very nice.'
Monica	 Yeah! Joey has the best boyfriend ever!'
Chandler	 I kissed Kathy.'
Ross	 What?'
Monica	 Are you serious?'
Phoebe	 Does Joey know?'
Chandler	 No. Is there anyway, anyway you think he\xc2\x92ll\nunderstand this?'
Monica	 You obviously haven\xc2\x92t screwed over a lot of your friends. (They all\nlook at her) Which we all appreciate.'
Ross	 No the-the sad thing is, if you had told him how you felt before you\nkissed her, knowing Joey, he probably just would\xc2\x92ve just stepped aside.'
Chandler	 Oh, don\xc2\x92t say that! Don\xc2\x92t say that. That\xc2\x92s not true. Is\nit?'
Phoebe	 I think maybe, yeah.'
Monica	 He loves you.'
Chandler	 Then why didn\xc2\x92t you tell me to do that?!!'
Ross	 Well, I said-I said something to Phoebe.'
Phoebe	 Yeah! No, that\xc2\x92s right. And I thought it was a really good idea.'
Rachel	 I know, I remember that!'
Monica	 I remember you did.'
Chandler	 God!! (Sits down in disgust.) What am I gonna do?!'
Rachel	 Well, Chandler, you\xc2\x92re gonna have to tell him.'
Chandler	 Why?! Why do I have to tell him?!'
Rachel	 Because you do.'
Chandler	 Yeah, I know.'
Ross	 Hey, would it be okay if I wrote a song about this.'
Chandler	 Hey!'
Joey	 Hey! Samboucha Margarita? '
Chandler	 Is that a real thing?'
Joey	 Well, we only had samboucha, so it is now.'
Chandler	 Listen ah, Joe, I-I need to, I need to talk to you about something.'
Joey	 What\xc2\x92s up?'
Chandler	 It\xc2\x92s-it\xc2\x92s about Kathy. Umm, uh, I like her. I like her a lot\nactually.'
Joey	 You do?'
Chandler	 Yeah.'
Joey	 Well, you\xc2\x92re timing couldn\xc2\x92t be better. She\xc2\x92s not my\ngirlfriend anymore.'
Chandler	 What?'
Joey	 Yeah, she broke up with me.'
Chandler	 Oh uh, when?'
Joey	 Just now, after acting class. At first I thought she was doing some kind\nof scene, that\xc2\x92s why I let people watch.'
Chandler	 Oh man, I am so sorry. Are, are you okay?'
Joey	 Well, I\xc2\x92ve been better. But, I\xc2\x92m all right. So you like her huh?'
Chandler	 Yes, but I-I uh, don\xc2\x92t have too.'
Joey	 No-no-no, no it\xc2\x92s uh, it\xc2\x92s okay.'
Chandler	 Yeah?'
Joey	 Yeah. You know why? \xc2\x91Cause you came to me first.'
Chandler	 Well, I thought that would be the best thing to do.'
Joey	 But hey, listen just so you know, you might have you\xc2\x92re work cut out\nfor you. \xc2\x91Cause when I talked to her, I kinda got the feeling that she\xc2\x92s into\nsome other guy. So\xc2\x85'
Chandler	 See uh, that\xc2\x92s-that\xc2\x92s actually what I wanted to talk to you\nabout. I-I think I know who the other guy is.'
Joey	 Who?'
Chandler	 It\xc2\x92s me. I\xc2\x92m the other guy.'
Joey	 What?'
Chandler	 Yeah, I mean when you were late last night, Kathy and I got to\ntalking, and one thing to another and\xc2\x85'
Joey	 And what?! Did you sleep with her?!'
Chandler	 No! No! No! I just kissed her.'
Joey	 What?!! That\xc2\x92s even worse!!'
Chandler	 How is that worse?!'
Joey	 I don\xc2\x92t know! But it\xc2\x92s the same!'
Chandler	 Look, I\xc2\x92m sorry! But there\xc2\x92s nothing I can do, I think\nI\xc2\x92m in love with her!'
Joey	 Who cares?! You went behind my back! I would never do that to you!'
Chandler	 You\xc2\x92re right, I have no excuses! I was totally over the line.'
Joey	 Over the line?! You-you\xc2\x92re-you\xc2\x92re so far past the line, that\nyou-you can\xc2\x92t even see the line! The line is a dot to you!'
Chandler	 Yes. Yes! Right! And I feel horrible. You have to believe me!'
Joey	 Is that why you bought all this stuff?! (Chandler makes a face like\n"Well, kinda.") Well, y\xc2\x92know what I will not watch your TV, I will not\nlisten to your stereo, and there\xc2\x92s a cinnamon raisin loaf in the new bread maker that\nI\xc2\x92m not gonna eat! You know why?!'
Chandler	 Probably because\xc2\x85'
Joey	 Because it\xc2\x92s all tainted with your betrayal. From now on this\napartment is empty for me! And I\xc2\x92m not happy about you either. (The bread maker\ndings) Oh, and just so you know, I made that bread for you. (Joey walks into his bedroom\nand slams the door.)'

Phoebe	 Oh my God, he\xc2\x92s lost it. He\xc2\x92s totally lost it.'
Monica	 (removing ear plugs) What?'
Rachel	 Phoebe, his music could not get any worse. There are\nrats in the basement that are hanging themselves.'
Ross	 Thank you, thanks. (Sits down next to the girls) Yeah, I lost it.\nY\xc2\x92know, I\xc2\x92m not gonna play anymore, (to Phoebe) would you, can you finish my\nset?'
Phoebe	 After that? Yeah! No, I mean if I can help.'
Ross	 Yeah, like I could lose it.'
Rachel	 What?'
Ross	 I played bad on purpose guys.'
Monica	 Okay, so you were trying to play bad this whole time.'
Ross	 Yeah\xc2\x97no, just that last song.'
