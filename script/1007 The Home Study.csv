Ross	 Hey you guys!'
Phoebe	 Hey!'
Ross	 Hey, what are you doing?'
Mike	 Oh, figuring out our wedding plans.'
Chandler	 That's funny, we were doing the same thing!"
Ross	 Yeah!'
Phoebe	 It's really crazy! The hall, the dress, the food... I-I had no idea \n  how expensive this stuff was!"
Chandler	 Yeah it is really pricey. I mean, I freaked when I first heard the \n  numbers.'
Phoebe	 So what did you two do about it?'
Chandler	 It was pretty simple actually, I came up with a couple of cost-cutting \n  solutions, wrote out a list and Monica told me to go to hell.'
Ross	 There's no way around it Pheebs, you just gonna have to accept the fact \n  that this is gonna cost you a lot of money."
Mike	 I heard that weddings are like a 40 billion dollar a year industry.'
Ross	 Yeah, and I'm responsible for just like half of that."
Phoebe	 But really, it does seem like this money could be put to better use?'
Mike	 Are you serious?'
Phoebe	 Yeah! Now, how would you feel if we gave all the wedding money to charity \n  and we just got married at City Hall?'
Mike	 I think it would make me wanna marry you even more. (he kisses her)'
Ross	 I've got to say you guys, that's an incredible gesture!"
Chandler	 (to Ross) Maybe you do that next time you get married!'
Ross	 No, no, no. The next time it's gonna be a Hawaii at sunset. [pause] But \n  maybe the time after that!"

Joey	 Hey!'
Chandler	 Hey!'
Joey	 What's going on?"
Chandler	 Our adoption social worker is coming by today so we are cleaning \n  the apartment.'
Monica	 (sarcastically) We?'
Chandler	 You know you don't want me to help. You can't have it both ways!"
Joey	 Hey, is this person who decides whether or not you... get a baby?'
Chandler	 Kind of. She's coming by to interview us and see where we live."
Monica	 And it has to go perfectly, because if she doesn't like something about \n  us she can keep us off every adoption list in the state."
Joey	 Hey, maybe I should stop by! She could be a soap opera fan! It's very \n  impressive when the little people know a celebrity."
Chandler	 (pointing at himself) Little people?'
Joey	 (pointing at himself) Celebrity.'
Monica	 Ok, so I think I'm just about done here, unless you have any bad stuff \n  hidden somewhere, like... porn or cigarettes?"
Chandler	 What...? NO!'
Monica	 Chandler?'
Chandler	 (he stands up and he feels very offended) I don't, and I'm offended \n  by the insinuation!"
Monica	 Ok, so there's not a magazine under the couch, or a pack of cigarettes \n  taped to the back of the toilet tank, or a filthy video in the VCR?"
Chandler	 I'll admit to the cigarettes and the magazine, but that tape is not \n  mine."
Monica	 It isn't mine!"
Joey	 (going out with the VCR in his hand) Well, I guess we'll never know whose \n  it is!\n"
Charity guy	 May I help you? '
Phoebe	 Yes. We're here to make a rather sizeable donation to the children."
Charity guy	 Well, any contribution, large or small, is always appreciated.'
Phoebe	 Well, I think you're gonna appreciate it the crap out of this one (she \n  gives him a check)"
Charity guy	 Well, this is very generous!'
Phoebe	 And we don't want any recognition. This is completely anonymous."
Mike	 Completely anonymous. From two kind strangers.'
Phoebe	 Mr. X and Phoebe Buffay.'
Charity guy	 Well if you like, we can include your names in our newsletter.'
Mike	 Not necessary.'
Phoebe	 Buffay is spelled B-U-F-F-A-Y.'
Mike	 And "X" is spelled uhm... "Mike Hannigan".'
Charity guy	 Right. Well, on behalf of the children
Phoebe	 Sure, I so glad we did this. It feels so good!'
Mike	 It does. It feels really good!'
Phoebe	 Oh, look! And we get these free t-shirts! (she takes a t-shirt which \n  was on the counter)'
Charity guy	 Oh, actually, that's the shirt I wore to the gym."
Phoebe	 Mhm... it's moist."
Ross	 (he enters) Hi!'
Rachel	 Hi! Emma will be up in a minute!'
Ross	 Oh, good!'
Rachel	 Oh hey Ross... Listen, I heard about you and Charlie. I'm really sorry."
Ross	 Oh, that's OK. I'm sure there are tons of other beautiful paleontologists \n  out there."
Rachel	 Absolutely.'
Ross	 There was one! She's it! All the rest look like they should live under \n  a bridge!"
Rachel	 So, uhm... what are you gonna do today?'
Ross	 Well, I was thinking of taking Emma to the playground!'
Rachel	 Oh my God, what!?'
Ross	 Like I said I was thinking of taking Emma to the museum of knives and \n  fire!'
Rachel	 Ok, look, Ross. I do not want Emma going to the playground.'
Ross	 Be-caaauuuse...'
Rachel	 (upset) All right, well, if you must know... I had a traumatic... swing \n  incident... when I was little.'
Ross	 Seriously?'
Rachel	 Yes, I was 4 years old and I was on the swing and then all of a sudden \n  my hair got tangled in the chain. And to get me out my mom had to-had to cut \n  a big chunk of my hair! (crying) And it was uneven for weeks!'
Ross	 (sarcastic) And you made it through that? I wonder who's gonna play you \n  in the movie!"
Rachel	 Ok, fine! You can make fun of me. I do not want Emma going there. And \n  I was thinking Claire Danes.'
Ross	 Look, I'm sorry to hear about your tragedy, ok? But the swings are perfectly \n  safe, and besides Emma loves them. You know what, you should come with us and \n  you'll see!"
Rachel	 Ross, those things go like 40 miles an hour! Ok? When you're... and \n  there is that moment when you are at the top, when you just don't know if you're \n  gonna return back to earth!"
Ross	 Space is filled with orbiting children. (pause) Look, please, just come \n  on, you know, when you\xe2\x80\x99ll see the look on Emma\xe2\x80\x99s face, I swear you \n  won\xe2\x80\x99t regret it.'
Rachel	 All right!'
Ross	 Good, you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be one of those mothers who pass on their \n  irrational fears on their children, do you?'
Rachel	 Irrational, huh? All right, well, I\xe2\x80\x99ll remember that the next \n  time you freak out about a spider in your apartment!'
Ross	 Oh, yeah, that\xe2\x80\x99s the same, I am sure there are thirty different \n  species of poisonous swings!\n'
Monica	 Oh my God, the adoption lady is early!\n'
Chandler	 Ok, ok, here we go.'
Monica	 Ok.'
Chandler	 Here we go. Stand up straight. (smiling) Big smile. (opens the door \n  and both are smiling exaggeratedly)'
Phoebe	 Hello, is this the creepy residence?'
Monica	 We\xe2\x80\x99re waiting for the adoption lady, but, hey, I\xe2\x80\x99m glad \n  you\xe2\x80\x99re here. I was cleaning this morning and I found this (she puts a \n  box on the table and opens it). I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if you wanna use it, but\xe2\x80\xa6'
Phoebe	 Awe, this is so sweet of you! But you know what? I won\xe2\x80\x99t be needing \n  a veil, I actually won\xe2\x80\x99t be wearing a dress at all!'
Monica	 I told you! I am not coming to a naked wedding! '
Phoebe	 No, no, no, we\xe2\x80\x99re not having a big reception, we took the money \n  we were gonna spend on a wedding and we donate them to the children charity.'
Monica	 That\xe2\x80\x99s crazy! (Phoebe looks bewildered). I am sorry. I just can\xe2\x80\x99t \n  imagine giving up my one wedding day like that!'
Phoebe	 We, you know, we\xe2\x80\x99re different! We don\xe2\x80\x99t care about having \n  a huge party. (She picks up the veil) This is really nice for you, but, oh, \n  please, I put this on? (she puts it on) And, ow, I look (she looks her reflex \n  image on a toaster), why, well, radiant. (pause) All right, well, who cares, \n  I don\xe2\x80\x99t need a pretty veil and a fancy dress.'
Monica	 That\xe2\x80\x99s right. You\xe2\x80\x99re making a commitment and that\xe2\x80\x99s \n  the same, whether you do that at the Plaza or, where are you gonna do it?'
Phoebe	 City Hall.'
Monica	 Ow! (Chandler slaps her on her back) Oh, that sounds nice! I am just \n  there for jury duty. They really spruce that place up!'
Phoebe	 It\xe2\x80\x99s ok, it\xe2\x80\x99s ok. I made my decision. What I really want \n  is a great big wedding (she covers her mouth)'
Monica	 Yay!'
Chandler	 But you already gave all your money to charity!'
Phoebe	 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ll just ask for it back!'
Chandler	 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think you can do that!'
Monica	 Why not! This is her wedding day, this is way more important than some \n  stupid kids!'
Chandler	 That\xe2\x80\x99s sweet, honey, but save something for the adoption Lady.\n'
Rachel	 Ok, careful.'
Ross	 Ok.'
Rachel	 Careful, watch her hair. WATCH HER HAIR!'
Ross	 Rach, she\xe2\x80\x99s got like three hairs!'
Rachel	 I know (she touches Emma\xe2\x80\x99s head) but they\xe2\x80\x99re just so beautiful! \n  Oh, my God, I just pulled one out.'
Ross	 I promise you she\xe2\x80\x99s safe! No watch how much she loves this. '
Rachel	 Ok.'
Ross (to Emma)	 Ready sweety?'
Rachel	 Ok.'
Ross	 Here we go! (He starts pushing Emma)'
Rachel	 Ok, careful, ok. (Emma giggles) Oh, she\xe2\x80\x99s smiling! Oh my God, \n  she does like it!'
Ross	 See, I told you!'
Rachel	 Awe! (Emma laughs) Oh my God! Looks, she\xe2\x80\x99s a little dare-devil! \n  Oh, let me push, can I push?'
Ross	 Oh, absolutely!'
Rachel	 Ok. Oh God. (To Ross) Get the camera, it\xe2\x80\x99s in the diaper bag.'
Ross	 Ok! (he takes the camera and walks backwards to take a shot) See? Scared \n  of swings, I bet you feel pretty silly (a swinging boy knocks him down) Ow!\n'
Mike	 We\xe2\x80\x99re seriously asking for our money back?'
Phoebe	 It\xe2\x80\x99s for our wedding day! Right, now, is this guy gay or straight, \n  because one of us gonna have to start flirting.'
Charity guy	 Wow! Are you here to make another donation the same day? I don\xe2\x80\x99t \n  think that that\xe2\x80\x99s ever happened before.'
Phoebe (to Mike)	 Gay, go.'
Mike (to the charity guy)	 Oh my God, I love your shirt!'
Phoebe	 The donation we made earlier, we k\xe2\x80\xa6, we w\xe2\x80\xa6, we want it \n  back.'
Charity guy	 Excuse me?'
Phoebe	 Yeah. See, that money was for a big wedding, that we thought we didn\xe2\x80\x99t \n  want, but it turns out we do.'
Charity guy	 So you\xe2\x80\x99re asking us to refund your donation to the children?'
Mike	 Yeah! This feels really good.'
Phoebe	 I am sorry. I am, but this wedding is just really important to me.'
Charity guy	 Hey, it\xe2\x80\x99s not my business, (he takes their check from a \n  drawer) besides it\xe2\x80\x99s probably a good thing. We really would have been \n  spoiling the children, all those food, and warm clothing\xe2\x80\xa6'
Phoebe	 Hey, that\xe2\x80\x99s not fair! A person\xe2\x80\x99s wedding is important! \n  And especially to me! Ok? I didn\xe2\x80\x99t have a graduation party! And I didn\xe2\x80\x99t \n  go to Prom. And I spent my sweet sixteen being chased round a tire yard by an \n  escaped mental patient who is his own words wanted to \xe2\x80\x9ckill me\xe2\x80\x9d \n  or whatever. So I deserve a real celebration and I am not gonna let some sweaty \n  little man make me feel badly about it.( She storms out)'
Mike	 She could have been talking about either one of us.'
Laura	 Hi, I am Laura, I am here for your adoption interview.'
Monica	 Hi, I am Monica and this is Chandler. Please come in.'
Laura	 Thank you!'
Monica	 Would you like something to drink?'
Laura	 Oh, water would be fine.'
Monica	 Ok. Great. I am so glad that you are here. We\xe2\x80\x99re really excited \n  about getting this process started.'
Chandler	 Oh, because we love kids. Love \xe2\x80\x98em to death.Well, not actually \n  to death, that's just a figure of speech - we love kids the appropriate amount... \n  as allowed by law."
Laura	 Your place is just lovely.'
Monica	 Ah, thank you. This building does have a wholesome family feel to it.'
Laura	 You know, I... I feel like I've been here before. Are any other couples \n  in the \n  building adopting?"
Monica	 Is that that couple on the first floor? Because we should get a baby \n  before \n  them. Yeah! That guy tried to sell me drugs. (Laura looks shocked)'
Chandler	 But other than that... wholesome, wholesome building.'
Laura	 Oh...'
Chandler	 What?'
Laura	 I just realized why I remember this place.'
Monica	 Really? What is it?'
Laura	 Oh, it's nothing. I went on a date with a guy who lived in this building \n  and it \n  didn't end very well."
Monica	 Ohh... that wouldn't by any chance be... Joey Tribbiani?"
Laura	 Yes!'
Chandler	 Of course it was!'
Laura	 Yeah, we had a really great night and in the morning he promised he \n  would call \n  me and he didn't."
Chandler	 RAT BASTARD!'
Laura	 So you're not friends with him?"
Monica and Chandler	 OH GOD NO! Nope, no, no, no. No! No, no. Nope! No, no, \n  no, no, no, no, no, no, no. NO! (finally Monica concludes) No!'
Laura	 Well, I'm sorry I brought it up. So, are either one of you planning \n  on staying at \n  home with your child... (someone knocks on the door)"
Joey	 (form the other side of the door) Hellooo? Anybody in there order a celebrity? \n  \n  (He starts to enter the apartment and Chandler runs to the door and shuts it \n  back in \n  his face) OW!'
Laura	 What was that?'
Chandler	 Oh, it's just some crazy guy who roams the halls here. He's great \n  with \n  kids though."
Rachel	 Oh, oh Ross, oh my God, are you okay?'
Ross	 SON OF A BITCH! (turns to his right to see three kids staring at him) \n  (To the \n  kids) Oh relax! I didn't say the 'F' word! (They go away)"
Rachel	 Ross, see! I told you, those swings are evil! Alright, that is it. \n  That is \n  the last time Emma is getting on one of those things for her entire life.'
Ross	 No! No, no, no, no, okay, it wasn't the swing's fault. It was my fault \n  and kind \n  of that (point to the kid that kicked him) kids fault. Who is still laughing. \n  Nice. "
Rachel	 Ross, c'mon, please. Can we just get out of here, before somebody else \n  gets \n  hurt?"
Ross	 No wait, okay, okay, I have an idea. I want you to get on the swing, \n  okay? And \n  you'll see that there's nothing to be afraid of. "
Rachel	 (looks at him suspiciously) I know what this is all about... You've \n  always been \n  jealous of my hair."
Ross	 Look, I just think you're an adult, okay? And you should get over your \n  silly \n  fears."
Rachel	 Alright fine. I'll do it."
Ross	 Good.'
Rachel	 If you hold a spider. '
Ross	 (He freaks out and starts jumping around brushing his sweater) WHAT? \n  WHERE? WHERE?'
Rachel	 IF you hold a spider.'
Ross	 I know. (Rachel bends down to Emma and Ross looks over his shoulder again, \n  \n  afraid)\n'
Joey	 Guys? Everything ok? It's me, Joe..."
Chandler	 (Screams to interrupt Joey) AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA......AAAaaa-doption!!'
Laura	 What's going on?"
Chandler	 Oh, just like I said. That crazy... Bert... roaming the halls. (Joey \n  bangs on \n  the door again)'
Joey	 Guys!?'
Monica	 Keep on roaming Bert! We don't want any crazy today!"
Joey	 What's going on?"
Chandler	 WE'LL TALK TO YOU LATER, BERT. EVERYTHNG'S FINE!! "
Joey	 Everything doesn't sound fine!"
Laura	 Is he alright out there by himself?'
Chandler	 Oh yeah! He has a caretaker. His older brother... Ernie.'
Laura	 Bert and Ernie!'
Chandler	 (nervous smile) You can't make this stuff up!\n"
Mike	 You never told me about that guy on your sweet sixteen. Oh, ugh. I'm \n  sorry about \n  that."
Phoebe	 (Lightly) Oh! It ended okay. One of my friends shot him. '
Mike	 Well, hey, at least you're getting a proper wedding. I mean, you really \n  deserve that."
Phoebe	 Yeah, I really do. You know, I had nothing growing up. (thinks for \n  a few \n  seconds) Just like the kids I took the money from.'
Mike	 No! No, no. I see where this is going. Don't make me go back there."
Phoebe	 Look, I can't have a wedding with this money now. It's tainted."
Mike	 Alright, fine. We'll give the money back."
Phoebe	 And if that guy at the charity gives us a hard time, my friend hasn't \n  shot \n  anyone in a really long time."
Laura	 Well, I must say, this seems like a lovely environment to raise a child \n  in.'
Monica	 Oh, by the way, you are more than welcome to look under any of the \n  furniture, \n  because, believe me, you won't find any porn or cigarettes under there!"
Laura	 Oh! Well, actually, before we look around, let me make sure I have everything \n  I need \n  up to here...'
Monica	 (Pulls Laura into the spare room) Why don't I show you the baby's room?"
Chandler	 What the hell are you doing?'
Joey	 Well, you wouldn't let me in, so I thought you were in trouble."
Chandler	 Well, we're not."
Joey	 But you called me 'Bert'!? That's our code word for danger!"
Chandler	 We don't have a code word."
Joey	 We don't? We really should. From now on, 'Bert' will be our code word \n  for danger."
Monica	 So that was the baby's room. (They come out and Chandler throws Joey \n  behind \n  the couch and puts his foot on him. Monica looks at Chandler)"
Monica	 (To Chandler) What room should we see next?'
Chandler	 Any room that isn't behind this couch! (laughs nervously)"
Monica	 (laughs nervously as well, Laura looks confused) (To Laura) Some people \n  don't \n  get him, but I think he's really funny! (She takes Laura to their own bedroom)."
Joey	 (quivering with anger) I did not care for that!'
Chandler	 (escorting Joey to the door) You have to get out of here. You slept \n  with \n  our social worker and you never called her back and she is still pissed, so \n  she can't \n  see you."
Joey	 Ok, ok! (He leaves)'
Chandler	 Ok!'
Chandler	 What?'
Joey	 I forgot my bat.'
Laura	 Oh my God!'
Chandler	 And for the last time, we do not want to be friends with you! And \n  we don't want to buy your bat! (Joey lowers his bat)"
Laura	 What are you doing here?'
Joey	 (to Chandler) Bert! Bert! Bert! Bert!'
Laura	 Are you friends with him?'
Chandler	 I can explain... Joey...'
Joey	 Uhm... ok... uhm... Well, yeah... You have got some nerve, coming back \n  here. I can't believe you never called me."
Laura	 Excuse me?'
Joey	 Oh... yeah... Probably you don't even remember my name. It's Joey, by \n  the way. And don't bother telling me yours, because I totally remember it... \n  lady. Yeah! I waited weeks for you to call me."
Laura	 I gave you my number, you never called me.'
Joey	 No, no! Don't try to turn this around on me, ok? I'm not some kind of... \n  social work, ok, that you can just... do."
Laura	 (embarrassed towards Chandler and Monica) Well, I'm pretty sure I gave \n  you my number."
Joey	 Really? Think about it. Come on! You're a beautiful woman, smart, funny, \n  we had a really good time, huh? If I had your number, why wouldn't I call you?"
Laura	 I don't know... Well, maybe I'm wrong... I'm sorry..."
Joey	 No, no, hey, no! Too late for apologies... ok? You broke my heart. You \n  know how many women I had to sleep with to get over you? (and he leaves the \n  apartment, leaving her shocked)'
Laura	 Joey, wait!'
Joey	 (acting sad) NO! I waited a long time, I can't wait anymore... (and closes \n  the door behind him)"
Laura	 (laughing nervously) I'm sorry that you had to see that. I'm so embarrassed..."
Chandler	 Oh, that's really ok."
Monica	 Yeah, that we totally understand. Dating is hard.'
Laura	 Boy, you people are nice... And I've got to say... I think you're going \n  to make excellent parents."
Joey	 LAURA! (and points to her, very confident)'
Phoebe	 (to the Charity guy) We're back!"
Charity guy	 Are you here to take more money? Because, I think what you're \n  looking for is an ATM."
Mike	 No, no, we're here to give the money back."
Phoebe	 Yeah, because you know what, it's... it's all about the children. "
Phoebe	 Although... it's also about the wedding... Ugh, alright... here. (she \n  gives the check and pulls it back again) No... Oh God... Oh!"
Charity guy	 If I haven't said so already sir, (sarcastically pointing to Phoebe) \n  congratulations!"
Mike	 (takes the check from Phoebe) Ok, look! Enough! Alright? I'm stepping \n  in. I'm putting my foot down! As your future husband I'm going to make this \n  decision for us. (thinking) Now... what do you think we should do?"
Charity guy	 You know what? It's not your decision anymore."
Mike	 What?'
Charity guy	 On behalf of the Children of New York, I reject your money.'
Phoebe	 But... but... but we're giving you this!"
Charity guy	 Yeah... And I'm giving it back to you... Come on! Consider it \n  a contribution. (gives the check to Phoebe)"
Phoebe	 (looks at the amount on the check, and gasps) Well, this is very generous!'
Charity guy	 Please, take the check, go have a great wedding and a wonderful \n  life together.'
Mike	 Well, I mean... It sounds good to me. And that way we can save up, come \n  back in a few years and make an even bigger donation.'
Charity guy	 Absolutely! And when you do, make sure you ask for Brian.'
Phoebe	 Oh, is that you?'
Charity guy	 No!'
Monica	 Hello...? Oh hi... Oh my God...! Really...? I can't wait to tell Chandler... \n  Ok, goodbye. (hangs up)"
Chandler	 Wrong number?'
Monica	 It was Laura... She gave us a great report and we are officially on \n  the waiting list.'
Chandler	 That's great!"
Monica	 Now we just have to wait for a call and... and someone tells us there's \n  a baby waiting for us. Oh... "
Chandler	 Hello...? Have you seen Joey's bat?"

Rachel	 Ok... I got a spider. There were two, I picked the bigger one.'
Ross	 (nervously) Ok...'
Rachel	 Ok... (and passes the spider to Ross who holds it in between his hands)'
Ross	 (Gasps and speaks at a higher pitch) This feels perfectly normal. Ok, \n  get on the swing!'
Rachel	 (reluctantly) Ok... O-k...'
Rachel	 (more confident) Ok...'
Rachel	 whoo... ok... wow... ok... OH!'
Ross	 See?'
Rachel	 A-alright! I can do this.'
Ross	 There you go! Good for you! And you know what, I'm actually getting used \n  to this little guy. I don't really even feel him in here anymore."
Rachel	 That's because he's on your neck."
Ross	 Well... (realizes, screaming like a little girl, trying to get rid of \n  the spider) Whaa... aaah... aaahhh...'
Rachel	 ROSS!'
