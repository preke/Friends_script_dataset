Monica and Rachel	 (less than enthused) Great.'
Phoebe	 Yeah.'
Rachel	 So what-what is the exhibit.'
Phoebe	 It\xc2\x92s mostly just photographs of lesbian love scenes interspersed\nwith video games and free sandwiches.'
Joey	 Oh man! (Hits Chandler)'
Ross	 (entering) Hey!'
Rachel	 Hi!'
Chandler	 Hey!'
Joey	 Hey Ross listen Chandler got you out of going to the lesbian sandwich\nmuseum this weekend!'
Ross	 Thanks? But I have plans; Elizabeth and I are going out of town.'
Monica	 Oh that\xc2\x92s great!'
Ross	 Yeah.'
Monica	 I mean think about all the money that you\xc2\x92re gonna make!'
Ross	 Why? What?'
Monica	 Well, her father pays you for baby-sitting right?'
Ross	 No, no, that\xc2\x92s funny. But maybe it\xc2\x92s time to move on, let it go,\ny\xc2\x92know? Stop it! Besides, Rachel is going out with Elizabeth\xc2\x92s father, so ah,\nhe\xc2\x92s much older than she is. Looks like I\xc2\x92m not the only one interested in\nfossils, huh?'
Rachel	 I mean Ross all that does is remind us that you are interested in\nfossils.'
Ross	 Okay, okay. Uh, well uh, Rachel is going to need to yell sweet nothings\n(Paul enters) in his ear. '
Chandler	 Ross.'
Ross	 Oh, come on you guys; that\xc2\x92s funny! Y\xc2\x92know? Because he\xc2\x92s\nneed\xc2\x97he\xc2\x92s got like a hearing aide y\xc2\x92know, \xc2\x91cause-\xc2\x91cause\ny\xc2\x92know, \xc2\x91cause he\xc2\x92s all old, and\xc2\x85 '
Paul	 Okay look, Ross, just so you know that since Lizzie likes you so much,\nI\xc2\x92ve decided to accept the fact that you\xc2\x92re going out with her.'
Ross	 Really? That okay, that\xc2\x92s great.'
Paul	 Yeah. But then I changed my mind. I\xc2\x92m funny like that. So I told\nLizzie, now I\xc2\x92m telling you, I don\xc2\x92t want you seeing my daughter anymore.'
Ross	 All right look, I-I realize it upsets you.'
Paul	 Yes it does.'
Ross	 But, Elizabeth and I are-are both adults and so I don\xc2\x92t think\nthere\xc2\x92s really anything you can do about it.'
Paul	 I\xc2\x92ll call the university and tell them about your relationship and\nhave you fired.'
Ross	 Ohh! A man with a plan!'

Phoebe	 Oh, this is so exciting! You get your picture back up on the wall of\nfame! Eek!'
Joey	 I know. It was so cool when I was up there before. Me and Jim Belushi\nwould just be crackin\xc2\x92 up about something\xc2\x85 Then I get fired off of Days Of\nOur Lives and he takes me down. Now he\xc2\x92s just laughing at me. Look at him, that\nsmug Belushi bastard, I\xc2\x92ll\xc2\x85'
Phoebe	 (gasps) Ohh, okay maybe they put your picture back up they can put you\nnext to Matt Lauer. Look at him, smiling at me. (Giggles) Yeah I know; we\xc2\x92d be great\ntogether!'
Joey	 Hey! So I\xc2\x92m back.'
The Dry Cleaner	 Who are you?'
Joey	 Joey Tribbiani! From the wall! (The dry cleaner doesn\xc2\x92t remember)\nOkay, maybe this will jog your memory, huh? (Holds his picture up in front of his face.)\nHuh? Okay eh-ah-anyway, I\xc2\x92m ready to go back up on the wall I\xc2\x92m the star of a\nnew TV show.'
The Dry Cleaner	 (picking up a TV Guide) Show me in the table.'
Joey	 Oh well, it\xc2\x92s not on TV yet.'
The Dry Cleaner	 Well, then it\xc2\x92s not on the wall yet.'
Joey	 Okay, fine, I will bring you a tape, huh? (Walks away)'
Phoebe	 So umm, now do you have any of Matt Lauer\xc2\x92s clothes here? Maybe?\nJust ones that haven\xc2\x92t been cleaned yet? '
Monica	 Oh, I love museums!'
Rachel	 Umm.'
Monica	 Soakin\xc2\x92 up all the culture.'
Rachel	 Yeah.'
Monica	 Where do you want to start?'
Rachel	 Ooh, the gift shop!'
Monica	 Yeah!'
Phoebe	 Hey, and then lunch.'
Rachel	 Oh, wait yes, but I can\xc2\x92t eat too much. Paul is taking me out to\ndinner tonight, he said he has a big surprise planned.'
Phoebe	 Oh wow. What, do you think maybe he\xc2\x92s gonna tell you that he\xc2\x92s\ngay?'
Rachel	 What?! No! Why?!'
Phoebe	 No reason! That would just be a really big surprise, right?'
The Museum Official	 (to the couple) You can put the aisle over here (points),\nand put the wedding ceremony right over here. (Points.)'
Rachel	 I didn\xc2\x92t know you could get married here.'
Monica	 This would be a beautiful place to get married, yeah, but I\nwouldn\xc2\x92t put the aisle there and I would never have the ceremony there!\n(Points to both places.) I mean you\xc2\x92d have the ceremony under this big beautiful\narch. (The arch at the entrance to the room.) '
The Museum Official	 (To Monica) May I help you?'
Rachel	 Oh sorry didn\xc2\x92t mean to interrupt. It\xc2\x92s just such a beautiful\nspace; do you do a lot of weddings here?'
The Museum Official	 Yes. We\xc2\x92re very popular. There\xc2\x92s a two-year\nwaiting list. Sorry! (She kinda storms out with the couple.)'
Rachel	 Monica, you should totally put your name down on the list'
Monica	 What?! Are you crazy?! I\xc2\x92m not getting married! I\xc2\x92m not even\nengaged.'
Phoebe	 Yeah, but there\xc2\x92s a two-year wait. And then what if you get engaged\nin two years and then you got to wait another two years for this place. That\xc2\x92s\nfour years. Chandler\xc2\x92s not gonna wait that long. He\xc2\x92s gonna find somebody else,\ny\xc2\x92know? Someone, someone who did put their name on the list. (Rachel agrees.)'
Rachel	 Yeah hon, it can\xc2\x92t hurt to put your name down! I mean in if two\nyears if you\xc2\x92re not engaged you just don\xc2\x92t use it.'
Monica	 Well, I mean I guess there is no harm in putting my name down.'
Rachel	 I\xc2\x92m gonna do it too!'
Phoebe	 Me too!'
Rachel	 Really? Who would, who would you marry?'
Phoebe	 I don\xc2\x92t know, I don\xc2\x92t have anyone right now. Y\xc2\x92know?'
Rachel	 Oh Pheebs.'
Phoebe	 Don\xc2\x92t feel too sorry for me. At least my boyfriend isn\xc2\x92t gay.'
Monica	 Phoebe, that stuff is\xc2\x85'
Phoebe	 Don\xc2\x92t even get me started on yours!'
Joey	 (entering) Hey! So, did you watch the tape of my show?'
The Dry Cleaner	 I did.'
Joey	 All right, let\xc2\x92s get me back up there! (Holds out his picture.)'
The Dry Cleaner	 No! It don\xc2\x92t go up on the wall!'
Joey	 What\xc2\x97But you saw the show!'
The Dry Cleaner	 Yes, it was very offensive to my people!'
Joey	 Dry cleaners?'
The Dry Cleaner	 Russians! It showed them as terrorists and villains!'
Joey	 Okay! Okay, look! You-you-you got Harrison Ford up there!'
The Dry Cleaner	 That\xc2\x92s right. Mr. Ford is a very good customer, he brings\nus a lot of clothes; you bring us nothing!'
Joey	 Okay well that may be true. But, in-in okay, Air Force One the\nRussians were terrorists! And evil! And plus he kills a bunch of them!\nThat-that-that\xc2\x92s offensive to Russians.'
The Dry Cleaner	 I\xc2\x92ve never seen it!'
Joey	 Oh you should, it\xc2\x92s great.'
Ross	 This place is really beautiful!'
Elizabeth	 Yeah, I\xc2\x92ve been coming here since I was a kid. This used to be\nmy Grandma\xc2\x92s.'
Ross	 Wow! The only thing I got from my Grandmother was her eyes. I mean not-not\nher actual eyeballs, but, but people say that my eyes\xc2\x97Do-do you want to make out?'
Elizabeth	 Sure!'
Elizabeth	 Are you okay? What\xc2\x92s wrong?'
Ross	 Ehh, I was just, I was just thinking about your father.'
Elizabeth	 Well, whatever works for ya\xc2\x85'
Ross	 No. No-no uh, he just, he just really freaked me out before.'
Elizabeth	 Oh. Well, so we have to hide our relationship from one more person.\nBig deal. Besides, it\xc2\x92s kinda fun hiding.'
Ross	 Yeah.'
Elizabeth	 (quietly) Hey umm, you brought protection right?'
Ross	 (loudly) Why?! Are there like bears or something?! (Looks around and then\nsees that Elizabeth is shaking her head no and realizes what Elizabeth meant.) Ohh. Oh,\nprotection. Yeah-no, yeah-no, that-that-that I forgot.'
Elizabeth	 I\xc2\x92ll just run to the store and get some.'
Ross	 Oh no! Hey-hey, I\xc2\x92m the guy! I\xc2\x92ll get it.'
Elizabeth	 Do you know where the store is?'
Ross	 No.'
Elizabeth	 Do you want to ride around town on my little pink bicycle? '
Ross	 A little bit.'
Elizabeth	 (laughs) I\xc2\x92ll be back in ten minutes.'
Ross	 Okay.'
Elizabeth	 Why don\xc2\x92t you get in the hot tub and I\xc2\x92ll meet you there.'
Ross	 Ohh, okay.'

I want to let her know that there was a cancellation\nand if she\xc2\x92s still interested in having the Bing-Geller wedding at our facility, it\nis available\xc2\x85 (Chandler runs to answer the phone.)'

Rachel	 It\xc2\x92s so secluded up here.'
Paul	 I know. I like it up here.'
Rachel	 I feel like we\xc2\x92re the only two people in the world. (She sets down\nher wine class, picks up a walnut, and knocks another one on the floor.) Oops. Sorry. (She\nreaches down to pick it up and Ross hands it to her. Ross is hiding under the couch and\ncauses Rachel to scream.)'
Paul	 What\xc2\x92s the matter honey? Did you see a little mouse?'
Rachel	 No-no! Big bear! Big bear outside! I think I-I\xc2\x97would\nyou\xc2\x97actually, would you go check on that?'

Female Clerk	 He\xc2\x92s not here right now.'

She\xc2\x85 Maybe, she likes you. She likes you. Y\xc2\x92know why? Because\nyou\xc2\x92re a (pause) neat guy. (Ross can\xc2\x92t believe what he\xc2\x92s hearing.) You are\nthe man. You are (pause) the man! (He opens his shirt and looks at his chest.) I still got\nit. Nice and sexy. You\xc2\x92re just a love machine.

Phoebe	 What are you gonna do?'
Monica	 Well, I\xc2\x92m never gonna listen to you again, that\xc2\x92s for sure!\n(Mimicking her.) "Y\xc2\x92know, harm can it do if you go and put your name down?"'
Phoebe	 Rachel said that!'
Monica	 Well Rachel\xc2\x92s not here! (Runs out.)'
Phoebe	 Oh! Here it is! (Noticing it next to the door.) Ooh, Joey! Why did you\nsign it, "Son of a bitch?" (Son of a bitch is written across the entire\npicture.)'
Joey	 I didn\xc2\x92t do that! Who would\xc2\x92ve done that?!'
The Dry Cleaner	 (entering) Son of a bitch!'
Phoebe	 Okay, maybe ask this guy.'
The Dry Cleaner	 You, get out of my shop!'
Phoebe	 Well, what did he do?'
The Dry Cleaner	 He went out with my wife!'
Phoebe	 Joey!'
Joey	 Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa, I-I\xc2\x97Hey! I did not go out with your wife!\n(The same woman from before enters.) Okay? I went out with her! (Points at her.)'
The Dry Cleaner	 That\xc2\x92s my wife!!! Get out! (Starts yelling at him in\nRussian, and I\xc2\x92m betting he\xc2\x92s not saying pleasant things about him.)'
Phoebe	 Well, we should go.'
Joey	 Yeah.'
Elizabeth	 Ross? Ross?'
Ross	 Elizabeth! (He opens one of the bed stands that he has curled himself up\ninto.) Okay. Okay. (She helps him out.) I\xc2\x92m gonna go out this window. (Points to the\nwindow next to him.) I\xc2\x92ll meet you at the front door. Just tell them you\xc2\x92re\ngoing home, okay?'
Elizabeth	 Okay!'
Rachel	 (yelling from the living room) Oh wait-wait-wait!! No! Don\xc2\x92t go in\nthere! Don\xc2\x92t go in there! I need another soda!'
Paul	 Ross!'
Rachel	 Oh my God Ross! What in heaven\xc2\x92s name are you doing here?'
Ross	 (to Elizabeth) And that is why we cannot see each other anymore.'
Paul	 Ross. You and I are going to have to have a little talk.'
Elizabeth	 Daddy!'
Paul	 You\xc2\x92re next!!'
Elizabeth	 Okay. I didn\xc2\x92t know he was here. (Runs over to Rachel.)'
Paul	 Let me just see if I got this straight. I tell you to stay away from my\ndaughter or I\xc2\x92ll have you fired. What you heard was, "Take my daughter, come up\nto my country house, and ruin my weekend with Rachel!"'
Ross	 Okay, please-please Paul, just let me explain\xc2\x85'
Paul	 No, let me explain! Fired!!'
Ross	 All right, fine! Fine! Have me fired! But uh, I want you to know that you\nand I are not all that different. I mean, I too am a neat guy. (Paul just looks at him.)'
Paul	 (panicked) What? '
Ross	 And I too am just a love machine. (Hums a little bit and mimics\nPaul\xc2\x92s flexing.)'
Paul	 Ross, let me show you where the guest room is.'
Monica	 (going over to him) I\xc2\x92m so sorry. Please, stop freaking out.'
Chandler	 I\xc2\x92m not freaking out. Why would I be freaking out? A woman named\nHeldi called and said we were getting married, but that happens everyday. (Does one of\nthose Chandler noises.)'
Monica	 Honey, we were at this beautiful place, and I-I-I just put our names\ndown for fun! I mean, what\xc2\x92s the harm in that?'
Chandler	 Right here! (Clucks like a chicken for some reason.)'
Monica	 Chandler, please don\xc2\x92t think I was trying to pressure you. Phoebe\nand Rachel\xc2\x85'
Chandler	 Phoebe and Rachel! So the people that knew about our wedding before me\nwere you, Phoebe and Rachel, Heldi, and apparently some band called Starlight Magic 7 who\nare available by the way!'
Monica	 It was a mistake. Please don\xc2\x92t take this to mean anything, because\nit doesn\xc2\x92t.'
Chandler	 Okay.'
Monica	 Really?'
Chandler	 Yes, if it really doesn\xc2\x92t mean anything, because you know that\nI\xc2\x92m just not ready\xc2\x85'
Monica	 I know! I know.'
Chandler	 Okay. (They hug.)'
Monica	 I\xc2\x92m gonna go tell Joey that (laughs) that you\xc2\x92re back. I was\nreally worried about you. (Exits.)'
Phoebe	 (entering from her room) Hey, did she buy it?'
Chandler	 Totally.'
Phoebe	 So did Heldi show you the place?'
Chandler	 Yeah, it\xc2\x92s beautiful.'
Phoebe	 I can\xc2\x92t believe you\xc2\x92re gonna ask Monica to marry you!'
Chandler	 I know.'

Joey	 Hey Gunther.'
Gunther	 Hey! Take these cappuccinos to table 11 and that guy over there\n(points) wants the biscotti. '
Joey	 Oh uh, well I just came in for a cup of coffee to go.'
Gunther	 Do you still work here?'
Joey	 No! No, I quit a long time ago. (Pause) Did I forget to you that one?\nI\xc2\x92m sorry.'
Gunther	 Oh that\xc2\x92s cool, I was gonna fire you anyway.'
Joey	 Great! (Takes his coffee and leaves.)'
