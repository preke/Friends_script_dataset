Rachel	 Monica, you don\xc2\x92t even have a bed, you sleep in a ball on the\nfloor!'
Monica	 Y\xc2\x92know what? I am really tired of your bellyaching! Okay,\nI-I worked really hard at making this a nice place for us to live!'

Emily	 He does that?!'
Ross	 Uh, I don\xc2\x92t know, whatever.'
Emily	 I think it makes you look really dangerous.'
Ross	 Oh, I know. Y\xc2\x92know what, I never would\xc2\x92ve gotten this if it\nweren\xc2\x92t for you. No really, when I\xc2\x92m with you I\xc2\x92m-I\xc2\x92m like this whole\nother guy, I love that guy! I mean, I love you too, a lot, but that guy! I-I love\nthat guy!'

Ross	 One more day, seriously/'
Emily	 Don\xc2\x92t do this to me, again. You\xc2\x92d know I\xc2\x92d stay here in a\nminute, but I\xc2\x92d really miss so much work, they\xc2\x92ll fire me.'
Ross	 So, then you can stay as long as you want.'
Emily	 I wish I could.'
Ross	 Oh no. Don\xc2\x92t, don\xc2\x92t, don\xc2\x92t start packing. Come on! (She\nputs some clothes into her bag, and Ross throws them out.)'
Emily	 I don\xc2\x92t think you understand packing. Look, I just don\xc2\x92t want\nto leave it to the last minute. Last time I left in such a rush, I left my knickers here.'
Ross	 Yeah, I know, I uh, I tried them on.'
Emily	 You didn\xc2\x92t!'
Ross	 No. No, I didn\xc2\x92t. I didn\xc2\x92t want to be that guy.'

Chandler	 Uhh, a T-shirt that says, "I don\xc2\x92t belong here."'
Joey	 You have Knicks tickets?'
Rachel	 Yeah, my mom got my dad\xc2\x92s season tickets in the divorce, so she\njust gave them to me.'
Monica	 Yeah, apparently, they\xc2\x92re pretty good seats.'
Rachel	 Yeah.'
Joey	 (examining the tickets) Oh my God! Those are almost right on the floor!'
Rachel	 Do you guys want these?'

Monica	 What do you say?'
Chandler	 Forget it! Okay, I\xc2\x92m not giving up my bachelor pad for some\nbasketball seats!'
Rachel	 You\xc2\x92re bachelor pad?!'
Monica	 Have you even had a girl up here?'
Chandler	 No. But uh, Joey has, and I usually talk to them in the morning time.'

Joey	 Come on!'
Chandler	 (ignoring him) Yes, Gunther, can I get two cups of chino, please?'
Gunther	 Good one.'
Joey	 Come on, season tickets! Season tickets, do you know what that means?'
Chandler	 Forget it! Okay, I\xc2\x92m not giving up the apartment.'
Joey	 Oh come\xc2\x97look, when I was a kid my dad\xc2\x92s company gave season\ntickets to the number one salesman every year, all right? My dad never won! Of\ncourse, he wasn\xc2\x92t in the sales division, but still, I never ever, ever forgot that!'
Ross	 (entering) Hey, guys! (They both notice his new little friend)'
Joey	 Hey!'
Chandler	 Oh my God!'
Joey	 We don\xc2\x92t make enough fun of you already?'
Ross	 Oh yeah, Emily convinced me to do it.'
Chandler	 You do know that Wham broke up?'
Ross	 I like it, and Emily likes it, and that\xc2\x92s what counts. So uh, how are\nyou guys doing?'
Joey	 Oh-no, don\xc2\x92t try and talk all normal with that thing in your ear.'
Chandler	 Where is Emily?'
Ross	 Ugh, she\xc2\x92s saying good-bye to her uncle.'
Chandler	 Man, didn\xc2\x92t she like just get here?'
Ross	 Yeah!! Yeah!'
Chandler	 Easy tiger.'
Ross	 I just, I hate this so much! I mean, every time I go pick her up at the\nairport, it\xc2\x92s-it\xc2\x92s so great. But at the same time I\xc2\x92m thinking, "Well,\nI\xc2\x92m gonna be right back there in a couple of days, dropping her off."'
Chandler	 So what are you going to do?'
Ross	 Nothing! There\xc2\x92s nothing to do! I mean, she lives there, I live here.\nI mean, she-she\xc2\x92d have to uh, move here. She should move here!'
Joey	 What?'
Ross	 I could ask her to live with me!'
Chandler	 Are you serious?'
Ross	 I mean, why not! I mean, I mean why not?!'
Chandler	 Because you\xc2\x92ve only known her for six weeks! Okay, I\xc2\x92ve got\na carton of milk in my fridge I\xc2\x92ve had a longer relationship with!'
Ross	 Look guys, when I\xc2\x92m with her it\xc2\x92s-it\xc2\x92s-it\xc2\x92s like she\nbrings this-this-this great side out of me. I mean I-I-I love her, y\xc2\x92know?'
Chandler	 And I love the milk! But, I\xc2\x92m not gonna some British girl to move\nin with me! (Realizes that made no sense.) Joey, you say things now.'
Joey	 All right look, Ross, he\xc2\x92s right. Emily\xc2\x92s great, she\xc2\x92s\ngreat! But this way too soon, you\xc2\x92re only gonna scare her!'
Ross	 I don\xc2\x92t want to do that.'
Joey	 No! You don\xc2\x92t want to wreck it, you don\xc2\x92t want to go to fast!'
Ross	 Yeah, no, you\xc2\x92re right, I know, you\xc2\x92re right, I\xc2\x92m not,\nI\xc2\x92m not gonna do it. All right, thanks guys. (Gets up to leave.)'
Chandler	 Okay, no problem, just remember to wake us up before you go-go.'
Phoebe	 That\xc2\x92s too hard. Too hard!'
Monica	 (entering with Rachel) All right boys, last chance for the tickets!'
Rachel	 Or I\xc2\x92ll give them to my new boyfriend, Joshua.'
Chandler	 No thank you.'
Joey	 Wait-wait-wait-wait! (To Chandler) Come on! Come on, let\xc2\x92s trade! The\ntiming\xc2\x92s perfect, I just clogged the toilet! '
Chandler	 Look, I want those basketball seats as much as you do! Okay, but we\ncan\xc2\x92t leave in the small apartment after we\xc2\x92ve lived here! Didn\xc2\x92t you ever\nread Flowers for Algernon?'
Joey	 Yes! Didn\xc2\x92t you ever read Sports Illustrated?! No! I\ndidn\xc2\x92t read yours! But come on, we can go to the game tonight!'
Chandler	 Look, the only way I will even consider this is if they offer a lot\nmore than just season seats.'
Joey	 It\xc2\x92s the Knicks!'
Chandler	 Screw the Knicks!'
Joey	 Whoa!'
Chandler	 I didn\xc2\x92t mean that. I just meant that the apartment is worth so\nmuch more.'
Joey	 Huh.'
Chandler	 And the Knicks rule all.'
Joey	 Yeah, the Knicks rule all!'
Phoebe	 Hey, so? Are you gonna do it?'
Chandler	 No. No. We\xc2\x92re not gonna do that, y\xc2\x92know why? Because its not\nan even trade.'

Joey	 Done!'
Rachel	 Let me finish. '
Joey	 Oh. '
Rachel	 I\xc2\x92m talking about a bet, winner takes all.'
Joey	 Ooh, we could end up with nothing.'
Phoebe	 Or you could end up with everything.'
Joey	 Ooh, I like that.'
Monica	 All right, so what do you say?'
Chandler	 No!'
Monica	 Oh, just do it!!'
Chandler	 Op, op, I\xc2\x92m convinced!'
Joey	 Come on man, you know I\xc2\x92d do it for you! Because, you\xc2\x92re my best\nfriend.'
Chandler	 All right, but you can\xc2\x92t use that again for a whole year.\nI\xc2\x92m in.'
Joey	 All right!'
Phoebe	 Ooh, this is so exciting! Ooh, God, what are you going to bet?'

Emily	 It was.'

Chandler	 Those were like the best seats ever.'
Joey	 Oh yeah. Hey! Should we give these shirts to the girls? Y\xc2\x92know, kinda\nlike a peace offering.'
Chandler	 Oh yeah, that\xc2\x92s very nice. Plus, y\xc2\x92know they were free and\nthey\xc2\x92re too small.'
Chandler	 Oh. Oh, God! (He starts running around like a chicken with his head\ncut off.)'
Joey	 Hey, want a beer? (Hands him a beer and sits down in one of the chairs.)\n(Jumping up.) WHOA!!!!'

Rachel	 We took our apartment back!! (Slams the door shut.)'
Phoebe	 (opening the door) I had nothing to do with it. (Closes the door.)\n(Opens the door.) Okay, it was my idea, but I don\xc2\x92t feel good about it.'
Chandler	 We are switching back, right now!'
Monica	 No, we\xc2\x92re not! We\xc2\x92re not leaving!'
Chandler	 Well, you\xc2\x92re gonna have to leave sometime, because you both have\njobs, and as soon as you do, we\xc2\x92re switching it back! There\xc2\x92s nothing you can do\nto stop us! Right, Joe?'
Joey	 I don\xc2\x92t know.'

Chandler	 Totally worth it!'
Joey	 That was one good minute!'
Chandler	 Good night.'
Joey	 Good night.'
Monica	 Men are such idiots.'
Rachel	 Yeah! Can you believe that something that stupid actually got us our\napartment back?'
Phoebe	 That\xc2\x92s so funny to think if you\xc2\x92d just done that right after\nthe last contest, no one would have had to move at all.'
Monica	 Yeah, let-let-let\xc2\x92s pretend that\xc2\x92s not true.'
Rachel	 Yeah.'
Phoebe	 Okay, scarf\xc2\x92s done. (It\xc2\x92s not really a scarf, it\xc2\x92s just a\nbunch of yarn that Phoebe has tied together. Just then, Ross and Emily enter dragging with\nthem Joey and Chandler.)'
Ross	 Come on! Come on. Come on.'
Chandler	 Okay!'
Phoebe	 Hey!'

Ross	 We, we just decided to uh, to go for it.'
Emily	 I mean, we know it\xc2\x92s a bit hasty but, uh, it just feels so right,\nso\xc2\x85'
Ross	 (turning around.) Umm, uh, I was just telling the guys\xc2\x85'
Rachel	 Yeah, I-I heard. (Pause, everyone looks at each other, waiting for\nRachel\xc2\x92s reaction.) I think it\xc2\x92s great! (Hugs Ross.) Ohh, I\xc2\x92m so happy for\nyou!'
Chandler	 Oh, well, that\xc2\x92s great!'
Joey	 Yeah! Yeah!'
Monica	 (to Ross) I can\xc2\x92t believe you\xc2\x92re getting married! '
Ross	 Yeah. (They hug again.)'
Joey	 Monica and Rachel made out. (Giggles like a schoolboy and Monica glares at\nhim.)'
