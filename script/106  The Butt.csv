Rachel	 (reading the program) Ooh! Look! Look! Look! Look, there's Joey's\npicture! This is so exciting!"
Chandler	 You can always spot someone who's never seen one of his plays before.\nNotice, no fear, no sense of impending doom..."
Phoebe	 The exclamation point in the title scares me. (Gesturing) Y'know, it's\nnot just Freud, it's Freud!"
Ross	 Oh, shhh, shh. Magic is about to happen.'
Joey	 Vell, Eva, ve've done some excellent vork here, and I vould have to say,\nyour pwoblem is qviiite clear. (He goes into a song and dance number.) "
Rachel	 God. I feel violated.'
Monica	 Did anybody else feel they just wanted to peel the skin off their body,\nto have something else to do?'
Chandler	 (staring at a woman across the room) Ross, ten o'clock."
Ross	 Is it? Feels like two.'
Chandler	 No, ten o'clock."
Ross	 What?'
Chandler	 (sighs and gestures to explain) There's a beautiful woman at eight,\nnine, ten o'clock!"
Ross	 Oh. Hel-lo!'
Chandler	 She's amazing! She makes the women that I dream about look like short,\nfat, bald men!"
Monica	 Well, go over to her! She's not with anyone."
Chandler	 Oh yeah, and what would my opening line be? 'Excuse me.\nBlarrglarrghh.'"
Rachel	 Oh, c'mon. She's a person, you can do it!"
Chandler	 Oh please, could she be more out of my league? Ross,\nback me up here.'
Ross	 He could never get a woman like that in a million years.'
Chandler	 Thank you, buddy.'
Phoebe	 Oh, oh, but y'know, you always see these really beautiful women with\nthese really nothing guys, you could be one of those guys."
Monica	 You could do that!'
Chandler	 Y'think?"
All	 Yeah!'
Chandler	 Oh God, I can't believe I'm even considering this... I'm very very\naware of my tongue..."
Ross	 C'mon! C'mon!"
Chandler	 Here goes. (He walks over to her but just stands there.)'
Aurora	 ...Yes?'
Chandler	 Hi.... um... okay, next word... would be... Chandler! Chandler is my\nname, and, uh...(He clears his throat noisily)...hi.'
Aurora	 Yes, you said that.'
Chandler	 Yes, yes I did, but what I didn't say was what I was about to say,\nwhat I wanted to say was, uh... would you like to go out with me sometime, thankyou,\ngoodnight. (He walks back to the others but she calls him back.) "
Aurora	 Chandler?'
All	 Hey! You're in a play! I didn't know you could dance! You had a beard!"
Joey	 Whadja think?'
All	 ...Hey! You're in a play! I didn't know you could dance! You had a beard!"
Joey	 C'mon, you guys, it wasn't that bad. It was better than that thing I did\nwith the trolls, at least you got to see my head."
All	 (admitting) Saw your head. Saw your head.'
Chandler	 (running back) She said yes!! She said yes!! (To Joey) Awful play,\nman. Whoah. (To All) Her name's Aurora, and she's Italian, and she pronounces my name\n'Chand-lrr'. 'Chand-lrr'. I think I like it better that way. (To Joey) Oh, listen, the\nusher gave me this to give to you. (He fishes a card out of his pocket.)"
Rachel	 What is it?'
Joey	 The Estelle Leonard Talent Agency. Wow, an agency left me its card! Maybe\nthey wanna sign me!'
Phoebe	 Based on this play? ...Based on this play!'
Chandler	 Hey, kids. '
All	 Hey.'
Phoebe	 (reading Monica's palm) No, 'cause this line is passion, and this is...\njust a line."
Chandler	 Well, I can't believe I've been here almost seven seconds and you\nhaven't asked me how my date went."
Monica	 Oh, right, right. How was your date, 'Chand-lrr'?"
Chandler	 It was unbelievable. I-I've never met anyone like her. She's had the\nmost amazing life! She was in the Israeli army..."
Aurora	 ...Luckily none of the bullets hit the engine block. So, we made it\nto the border, but just barely, and I- ...I've been talking about myself all night long,\nI'm sorry. What about you? Tell me one of your stories."
Chandler	 Alright. Once I got on the subway, right, and it was at night, and I\nrode it all the way to Brooklyn... just for the hell of it.'
Chandler	 We talked 'til like two. It was this perfect evening... more or\nless."
Aurora	 ...All of a sudden we realised we were in Yammon. '
Chandler	 Oh, I'm sorry, so 'we' is?"
Aurora	 'We' would be me and Rick."
Joey	 Who's Rick?"
Chandler	 Who's Rick?"
Aurora	 My husband.'
All	 Ooooohhh.'
Chandler	 Oh, so you're divorced?"
Aurora	 No.'
Chandler	 Oh, I'm sorry, then you're widowed?...Hopefully?"
Aurora	 No, I'm still married."
Chandler	 So tell me, how do- how do you think your husband would feel about you\nsitting here with me?...Sliding your foot so far up my pant leg you can count the change\nin my pocket?'
Aurora	 Don't worry. I imagine he'd be okay with you because really, he's okay\nwith Ethan."
Chandler	 Ethan? There's, there's an Ethan?"
Aurora	 Mmmm... Ethan is my... boyfriend.'
All	 What?!'
Chandler	 So explain something to me here, uh, what kind of a relationship do\nyou imagine us having if you already have a husband and a boyfriend?'
Aurora	 I suppose mainly sexual.'
Chandler	 ...Hm.'
Monica	 Oh. I'm sorry it didn't work out."
Chandler	 What 'not work out'? I'm seeing her again on Thursday. Didn't you\nlisten to the story?"
Monica	 Didn't you listen to the story? I mean, this is twisted! How could you\nget involved with a woman like this?"
Chandler	 Well, y'know, I had some trouble with it at first too, but the way I\nlook at it is, I get all the good stuff
Phoebe	 Oh, yeah. That is not true. Ross, is this your fantasy?'
Ross	 No, of course not! (Thinks) ...Yeah, yeah, it is.'
Monica	 What? So you guys don't mind going out with someone else who's going out\nwith someone else?"
Joey	 I couldn't do it."
Monica	 Good for you, Joey.'
Joey	 When I'm with a woman, I need to know that I'm going out with\nmore people than she is."
Ross	 Well, y'know, monogamy can be a, uh, tricky concept. I mean,\nanthropologically speaking-"
Ross	 Fine. Fine, alright, now you'll never know."
Monica	 We're kidding. C'mon, tell us!"
All	 Yeah! C'mon!"
Ross	 Alright. There's a theory, put forth by Richard Leakey-"
Rachel	 Tah-daaah!'
Chandler	 Are we greeting each other this way now? 'Cause I like that."
Rachel	 Look! I cleaned! I did the windows, I did the floors... I even used all\nthe attachments on the vacuum, except that little round one with the bristles, I don't\nknow what that's for."
Ross	 Oh yeah, nobody knows. And we're not supposed to ask."
Rachel	 Well, whaddya think?'
All	 Very clean! It looks great! Terrific!'
Monica	 ...Oh! I-I see you moved the green ottoman.'
All	 Uh-oh...'
Monica	 How-how did that happen?'
Rachel	 I dunno.. I-I thought it looked better there. And I- and also, it's an\nextra seat around the coffee table."
Monica	 Yeah, yeah, it's interesting.. but y'know what? Just for fun, let's see\nwhat it looked like in the old spot. (She moves it.) Alright, just to compare. Let's see.\nWell, it looks good there too. Let's just leave it there for a while."
Phoebe	 (to Rachel) I can't believe you tried to move the green ottoman."
Chandler	 Thank God you didn't try to fan out the magazines. I mean, she'll\nscratch your eyes right out."
Monica	 You guys, I am not that bad!'
Phoebe	 Yeah, you are, Monica. Remember when I lived with you? You were like, a\nlittle, y'know, (psycho) Ree! Ree! Ree! Ree!"
Monica	 That is so unfair!'
Ross	 Oh c'mon! When we were kids, yours was the only Raggedy Ann doll that\nwasn't raggedy!"
Monica	 Okay, so I'm responsible, I'm organised. But hey, I can be a kook."
Ross	 Alright, you madcap gal. Try to imagine this. The phone bill arrives, but\nyou don't pay it right away."
Monica	 Why not?'
Ross	 Because you're a kook! Instead you wait until they send you a notice."
Monica	 I could do that.'
Rachel	 Okay, uh, you let me go grocery shopping, and I buy laundry detergent,\nbut it's not the one with the easy-pour spout."
Monica	 Why would someone do that?! ...One might wonder.'
Chandler	 Someone's left a glass on the coffee table. There's no coaster. It's a\ncold drink, it's a hot day. Little beads of condensation are inching their way closer and\ncloser to the surface of the wood..."
Monica	 STOP IT!! ...Oh my God. It's true! Who am I?"
Ross	 Monica? You're Mom."
Phoebe	 Ree! Ree! Ree! Ree! Ree!'
Joey	 (on phone) Uh huh.. uh huh... oh my God! Okay! Okay, I'll be there! (He\nhangs up and to all.) That was my agent. (He tosses and catches the phone.) My agent has\njust gotten me a job...in the new Al Pacino movie!"
All	 Oh my God! Whoah!'
Monica	 Well, what's the part?"
Joey	 Can you believe this? Al Pacino! This guy\'s the reason I became an actor!\n"I\'m out of order? Pfeeeh. You\'re out of order! This whole courtroom\'s out of\norder!"'
Phoebe	 Seriously, what-what's the part?"
Joey	 "Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in!"'
Ross	 C'mon, seriously, Joey, what's the part?"
Joey	 ...I'm his (mumbles)"
Rachel	 ..You're, you're 'mah mah mah' what?"
Joey	 ...I'm his butt double. 'Kay? I play Al Pacino's butt. Alright? He goes\ninto the shower, and then- I'm his butt."
Monica	 (trying not to laugh) Oh my God.'
Joey	 C'mon, you guys. This is a real movie, and Al Pacino's in it, and that's\nbig!"
Chandler	 Oh no, it's terrific, it's... it's... y'know, you deserve this, after\nall your years of struggling, you've finally been able to crack your way into\nshowbusiness."
Joey	 Okay, okay, fine! Make jokes, I don't care! This is a big break for me!"
Ross	 You're right, you're right, it is...So you gonna invite us all to the big\nopening?"

Monica	 Alright, alright, alright... '
Joey	 Here. I need to borrow some moisturizer.'
Monica	 For what?'
Joey	 Whaddya think? Today's the big day!"
Monica	 Oh my God. Okay, go into the bathroom, use whatever you want, just don't\never tell me what you did in there."
Joey	 Thank you! (He goes into the bathroom.)'
Chandler	 Where's Joey? His mom's on the phone."
Monica	 He's in the bathroom. I don't think you wanna go in there!"
Chandler	 C'mon, we're roommates! (He goes into the bathroom, screams, and runs\nback out.) My eyes!! My eyes!!"
Monica	 I warned you...'
Rachel	 Who is being loud?'
Chandler	 Oh, that would be Monica. Hey, listen, I wanna borrow a coupla things,\nAurora spent the night, I really wanna make her breakfast.'
Monica	 Oh, you got the whole night, huh?'
Chandler	 Yeah, well, I only have twenty minutes until Ethan, so, y'know.. (He\nstarts to raid the fridge.)"
Rachel	 Ooh, do I sense a little bit of resentment?'
Chandler	 No, no resentment, believe me, it's worth it. 'Kay? Y'know in a\nrelationship you have these key moments that you know you'll remember for the rest of your\nlife? Well, every- single- second is like that with Aurora.. and I've just wasted about\nthirty-five of them talking to you people, so, uh.. Monica, can you help me with the door?\n(He has armloads of stuff.)"
Monica	 Sure. Oh, um, Chandler? Y'know, the-the old Monica would-would remind\nyou to scrub that Teflon pan with a plastic brush...But I'm not gonna do that. "
Director	 (on phone)...Dammit, hire the girl! (He hangs up the phone.)\nOkay, everybody ready?'
Joey	 Uh, listen, I just wanna thank you for this great opportunity.'
Director	 Lose the robe.'
Joey	 Me?'
Director	 That would work.'
Joey	 Right. Okay. Losing the robe. (He takes off the robe.) And the robe is\nlost.'
Director	 Okay, everybody, we'd like to get this in one take, please. Let's roll\nit.. water's working (The shower starts).. and... action."
Director	 And cut. Hey, Butt Guy, what the hell are you doing?'
Joey	 Well, I'm- I'm showering."
Director	 No, that was clenching.'
Joey	 Oh. Well, the way I see it, the guy's upset here, y'know? I mean, his\nwife's dead, his brother's missing... I think his butt would be angry here."
Director	 I think his butt would like to get this shot before lunch. Once again,\nrolling... water working... and action....and cut. What was that?'
Joey	 I was going for quiet desperation. But if you have to ask...'
Chandler	 God, I love these fingers...'
Aurora	 Thank you.'
Chandler	 No, actually I meant my fingers. Look at 'em, look at how happy they\nare."
Aurora	 (moves Chandler's arm and look at his watch.) Oh my God, I'm late. (She\nstarts to get up.)"
Chandler	 Oh no nonononononnononono, don't go.. (He kisses her and pulls her\nback down.)"
Aurora	 Okay.'
Chandler	 Don't go."
Aurora	 Okay. Oh no, I have to.'
Chandler	 (to himself) Too bad, she's leaving."
Aurora	 (getting up and dressing) I'm sorry. He'll be waiting for me."
Chandler	 Well, I thought- I thought you talked to Rick.'
Aurora	 It's not Rick."
Chandler	 What, Ethan? He got to spend the whole day with you!'
Aurora	 No, it's-it's Andrew. "
Chandler	 I know there'll be many moments in the years to come when I'll regret\nasking the following question, but- And Andrew is?"
Aurora	 He's... new."
Chandler	 Oh, so what you're saying is you're not completely fulfilled by Rick,\nEthan and myself?"
Aurora	 No, that's not exactly what I was.."
Chandler	 Well, y'know, most women would kill for three guys like us."
Aurora	 So what do you want?'
Chandler	 You.'
Aurora	 You have me!'
Chandler	 Nono, just you.'
Aurora	 Whaddyou mean?'
Chandler	 Lose the other guys.'
Aurora	 ...Like, ...all of them?'
Chandler	 C'mon, we're great together, why not?"
Aurora	 Why can't we just have what we have now? Why can't we just talk, and\nlaugh, and make love, without feeling obligated to one another... and up until tonight I\nthought that's what you wanted too."
Chandler	 ...Well, y'know, part of me wants that, but it's like I'm two guys,\ny'know? I mean, one guy's going 'Shut up! This is great!' But there's this other guy.\nActually it's the same guy that wells up every time that Grinch's heart grows three sizes\nand breaks that measuring device... And he's saying, y'know, 'This is too hard! Get out!\nGet out!'"
Aurora	 So... which one of the two guys will you listen to?'
Chandler	 I don't know, I-I have to listen to both of them, they don't exactly\nlet each other finish..."
Aurora	 Which one?'
Chandler	 ...The second guy.'
Aurora	 (gets up to leave) Well, call me if you change your mind.'
Chandler	 Sorry, the first guy runs the lips.'
Ross	 Look at it this way
All	 Hey!'
Monica	 Hey, waitwait, aren't you the guy that plays the butt in the new Al\nPacino movie?"
Joey	 Nope.'
Ross	 No? What happened, big guy?'
Chandler	 (to Ross) "Big guy?"'
Ross	 It felt like a 'big guy' moment."
Joey	 I got fired.'
All	 Oh!'
Joey	 Yeah, they said I acted too much with it. I told everybody about this! Now\neverybody's gonna go to the theatre, expecting to see me, and..."
Rachel	 Oh, Joey, you know what, no-one is gonna be able to tell.'
Joey	 My mom will.'
Chandler	 Something so sweet and...disturbing about that.'
Joey	 Y'know, I've done nothing but crappy plays for six years. And I finally\nget my shot, and I blow it!"
Monica	 Maybe this wasn't your shot."
Ross	 Yeah, I mean... I think when it's your shot, y'know, you-you know it's\nyour shot. Did it... feel like your shot..?"
Joey	 Hard to tell, I was naked.'
Phoebe	 No, I don't think this was your shot. I mean, I don't even think you\njust get one shot. I really believe big things are gonna happen for you, I do! You've\ngotta just keep thinking about the day that some kid is gonna run up to his friends and go\n'I got the part! I got the part! I'm gonna be Joey Tribbiani's ass!'."
Joey	 Yeah? That's so nice! (They hug.)"
Monica	 I'm sorry, Joey. I'm gonna go to bed, guys. "
All	 Night.'
Rachel	 Uh, Mon, you-you gonna leave your shoes out here?'
Monica	 (determined) Uh-huh!'
Rachel	 Really? Just casually strewn about in that reckless haphazard manner?'
Monica	 Doesn't matter, I'll get 'em tomorrow. Or not. Whenever. (He goes to her\nroom.)"
Ross	 She is a kook.'

Monica	 (hums for a while, then gives up, and in her head) If it bothers you\nthat much, just go out and get the shoes. No. Don't do this. This is stupid! I don't have\nto prove anything, I'm gonna go get them...But then everyone will know. Unless I get them,\nand then wake up really early and put them back! ...I need help! (She buries her head\nin her pillow.) "
