Chandler	 Buh-bye. (Hangs up the phone) I just got us reservations at\nMichelle\xc2\x92s and tickets to the Musicman to celebrate our first holiday season\nas a betroughed couple.'
Monica	 Betrothed\xc2\x85 (Corrects him)'
Chandler	 \xc2\x85betrothed couple.'
Phoebe	 (entering carrying a skull) Hey!'
Chandler	 Hey!'
Rachel and Monica	 Hi!'
Phoebe	 Haaaa... (Puts the skull on the table) ... ahhhh!'
Chandler	 Pheebs?'
Phoebe	 Huh?'
Chandler	 Skull?'
Phoebe	 Oh, yeah, it's my mom's."
Rachel	 (freaking out) Oh my god!!'
Phoebe	 No, no, no. It's not! It's not my mom. It belonged to mom. Yeah, no, she\nused to put it out every Christmas to remind us, that even though it's Christmas, people\nstill die. And, you can put candy in it. (She grabs the skull, pulls out a stick of\nlicorice, and takes a bite.)"
Ross	 (entering) Hey!'
All	 Hey!'
Monica	 (Offering Ross the skull) Licorice?'
Ross	 (Thinking it over) Sure! (Takes one) Hey, I just found out, I get Ben for\nthe holidays this year.'
All	 Ohh! That's great!"
Monica	 Are you gonna dress up as Santa?'
Ross	 Nope. I mean, I know Susan does every year, but I think I wanna take this\nyear to teach him all about Hanukkah.'
Phoebe	 And maybe I could teach Ben about the Christmas skull and how people\ndie.'
Rachel	 You may need to use this year to teach Ben about Phoebe.'
Ross	 Hmm.'
Joey	 Hey. (He exits)'
Rachel	 (to Monica) Did you know he was in there?'
Monica	 No.'
Chandler	 How long have we been home?'
Monica	 About a half an hour.'
Chandler	 Lovely!'

Chandler	 Hey, you know what I was thinking? When we get married, are you gonna\nchange your last name to Bing?'
Monica	 No.'
Chandler	 Why not?'
Monica	 Bing's weird."
Phoebe	 (entering) Oh, hey, you guys!'
Chandler	 Hey!'
Monica	 Hey!'
Phoebe	 Hey. Guess what! My landlord just called and my apartment is gonna get\nready soon, so I guess I'll be moving out."
Monica	 Ahh, Phoebe, I'm gonna miss you!"
Phoebe	 Yes, you will be very sad. All right, well I gotta go tell Rachel the\ngood news.'
Chandler	 Ohh! You guys gonna be living together again?'
Phoebe	 Yeah, why not?'
Chandler	 Well, she's just so much fun with Joey, I just assumed, she'd still be\nliving with him."
Phoebe	 Why do you think, she's having so much fun living with Joey?"
Chandler	 No reason, except\xc2\x85she\xc2\x85told\xc2\x85me.'
Phoebe	 Really? So she said, she didn\xc2\x92t wanna live with me anymore?'
Chandler	 No! No, she didn't say that. I-I-I think you should talk to Monica\nnow."
Monica	 Phoebe, don't worry about it. I'm sure she wants to live with you."
Phoebe	 You're sure? You're absolutely sure?"
Monica	 Well, no. But, um, I bet she probably does.'
Phoebe	 Probably? Yeah, I don\'t like that word. (Chandler and Monica look\nsurprised) Kind of what \xc2\x91probably\xc2\x92 really means. Yeah, uh-huh. Yeah, oh,\n"Your mom probably won\'t kill herself," y\xc2\x92know? I\'m sorry, but I\'m not\nhanging all my hopes of Rachel and I living together on-on "Probably!"\nY\xc2\x92know? You gotta take care of yourselves! (She starts to walk out) In this\nworld history teaches us nothing! (Exits)'
Chandler	 Bing doesn't seem so weird now, does it?"
Rachel	 (entering) Hey!'
Joey	 Hey! Great, you\xc2\x92re home! Guess what Phoebe got me for Christmas!\n(Starts drumming.)'
Rachel	 Drums?'
Joey	 (yelling) No! Drums!'
Chandler	 (to the Maitre d') Hi, could we get two burritos to go, please?\n(Laughs.)"
Monica	 I'm sorry. But not that sorry, 'cause you don't have to live with it.\nUm, we have a reservation under the name Chandler Bing."
Maitre d'	 Oh-kay, we'll have a table for you in about 45 minutes."
Chandler	 Forty-five minutes? We have tickets to the Musicman at 8
Maitre d'	 I'm sorry. Christmas is a very busy time, sir."
Chandler	 Is this because of the burrito thing?'
Monica	 (pulling Chandler away from the Maitre d') You need to give him money."
Chandler	 Give him money? It was a joke!'
Monica	 No, to get a table! Places like are always shakin\xc2\x92 you down.\nEverybody wants to be paid off.'
Chandler	 Right, calm down, O'Mally. I'll slip him some money."
Monica	 You've got to be smooth about it."
Chandler	 Hey, I can be smooth. (Walks back to the Maitre d', very smoothly)\nListen, we're a little bit in a hurry, so, if you can get us a table a little quicker, I'd\nappreciate it. (Shakes his hand)"
Maitre d'	 Of course, sir."
Chandler	 Okay. (Walks back to Monica)'
Monica	 How did it go?'
Chandler	 Had the money in the wrong hand. (Shows her his left hand with the\nmoney in it)'
Ross	 Wooooooo, hehehe. Hey, ahh, you don't feel like you're gonna throw up, do\nya?"
Ben	 No.'
Ross	 Well, I do, so let's... (Ben and Ross sit down on the couch) So, Ben, you\nuh, you know what holiday is coming up, don't ya?"
Ben	 Christmas.'
Ross	 Yep, and you know what other holiday is coming up?'
Ben	 Christmas eve.'
Ross	 Yes, but also (Pauses to let Ben answer, but he doesn\xc2\x92t.) Hanukkah!\nSee, you're part Jewish, and-and Hanukkah is a Jewish holiday."
Ben	 Santa has reindeers that can fly!'
Ross	 Right, um, but, on Hanukkah, Hanukkah is a celebration of a miracle. See,\nyears and years ago there were these people called the Maccabees.'
Ben	 (singing) Jingle bells, jingle bells...'
Ross	 (interrupts him) Okay, that's right, yes, but on Hanukkah, uh, we sing, uh\n(Sings) Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, I made you out of clay."
Ben	 (singing) Rudolph, the red-nosed reindeer...'
Ross	 (interrupts him again) Okay, it's not a contest."
Ben	 When is Santa coming?'
Ross	 Well, how about this year, instead of Santa, we have fun celebrating\nHanukkah?'
Ben	 No Santa? Was I bad?'
Ross	 No! Oh, no-no-no. Hey, you weren't bad, you've been very good, Ben."
Ben	 Santa's mad at me."
Ross	 No, hey-hey, come on, (He grabs Ben and sits him on his lap) Ben, Santa is\nnot mad at you, okay? Hey, you're-you're his favorite little guy!"
Ben	 So Santa's coming?"
Ross	 (disappointed) Yes! Santa's coming!"
Monica	 It's easy! Just keep it casual! Give him a kind word, shake his hand and\ngive him the money!"
Chandler	 How do you know so much about this?'
Monica	 I don't know."
Chandler	 Richard used to do it, didn't he?"
Monica	 We'd be eating our soup right now."
Chandler	 Mustached bastard\xc2\x85'
Monica	 (sees two people exit) Okay, those people just left, come on! Quick!\nGive him the money and get their table!'
Chandler	 (walks up to the Maitre d') Excuse me..."
Male Guest	 (to the Maitre d') Good evening. (Shakes his hand)"
Chandler	 (finds his money) Ahh-hahaha! (Turns around to give the Maitre d' his\nmoney, but he isn't there anymore)"
Rachel	 (stopping at Phoebe\xc2\x92s entrance) Ha!'
Phoebe	 So you like the drums! That's, that's great! Y\xc2\x92know, I was worried,\nthat, you know, they would maybe an unbearable living situation. All right, okay, well,\napparently not! So, yay!"
Joey	 Hey-hey, Pheebs, check it out, we already learned a song. (To Rachel)\nReady? One, two, three, four...'
Rachel and Joey	 Tequila!!'
Phoebe	 That's fun. (She exits disappointedly.)"

Gunther	 Here you go.'
Chandler	 Thank you Gunther, put it there. (He gets up, and shakes Gunther's\nhand. A bunch of coins fall out his hand. He sits down next to Monica.) Definitely not\neasier with coins. (Joey gets up and picks up the coins. Chandler thinks, Joey is just\nhelping him to pick them up.) Thank you."
Joey	 Thank you. (He gets up and puts on his jacket.) (Phoebe enters) Hey\nPheebs!'
Phoebe	 Hey!'
Joey	 Here. (Gives her the coins) Now I only owe you $49.50.'
Chandler	 Hey Pheebs!'
Phoebe	 Hey! (she sits down next to him)'
Chandler	 If you wanna give Joey a Christmas present that disrupts the entire\nbuilding, why not get him something a little bit more subtle, like a wrecking ball, or a\nvile of small pox to release in the hallway?'
Monica	 It\'s not just the drum noise. Every five minutes, Joey throws his sticks\nin the air, and I have to hear, "Oh my eye! Oh god, my eye!" I mean, it is so\nannoying.'
Phoebe	 Yes, thank you. You see, this is how normal people are supposed to react\nto drums.'
Monica	 Phoebe, you got Joey drums to annoy Rachel, so she wouldn't wanna live\nthere anymore?"
Phoebe	 Maybe on some level.'
Rachel	 Joey, y\xc2\x92know that you could just not throw the sticks up in the\nair.'
Joey	 What is Rock 'n' Roll about that?"
Phoebe	 (entering with an aquarium covered by a towel) Hey, Joey, I got you\nanother present. (She puts it on the counter)'
Joey	 Oh wait, before you tell me what it is! (He plays a drum-roll) Okay, what\nis it?'
Phoebe	 It's a\xc2\x85tarantula! (Joey almost falls down from his drum-stool\njumping up) Oh! God! Rachel, look, I'm sorry. What was I thinking giving Joey this big,\ngross, scary spider in such a poorly constructed cage?"
Rachel	 What are you talking about? I love them! (Looks into the cage) Yeah, I\nhad a tarantula when I was a kid. But it-it died, because my cat ate it. And then, then my\ncat died. But Joey, isn't this cool?"
Joey	 Is it on me? I feel, I feel like it's on me! I got, hey! (He storms into\nhis room)"
Rachel	 Oh, isn't that adorable? Joey is afraid of the tarantula."
Phoebe	 (sarcastic) Ah, yeah, he's so adorable, God, he's just so much fun, Joey\nis the best, I'm glad you're having so much fun here. (She turns around, about to leave)"
Rachel	 What? Wait-wait a minute, what? Phoebe, what's the matter?"
Phoebe	 Our apartment is ready.'
Rachel	 And that makes you angry because\xc2\x85'
Phoebe	 Because you would rather live here with Joey.'
Rachel	 Where did you get that?'
Phoebe	 Monica and Chandler said that you were having so much fun here. And\napparently no amount of drums or tarantulas is gonna change that.'
Rachel	 Phoebe?'
Phoebe	 Hm?'
Rachel	 Did you get all this stuff for Joey to try and drive me out of the\napartment? Honey, if you wanted to do that, you might as well just gotten him a fish, you\nknow how fish freaked me out!'
Phoebe	 (nods along) Fish!'
Rachel	 It wouldn't have mattered anyway, Phoebe, you and I are, are gonna live\ntogether, we're roommates; that's the deal."
Phoebe	 Yes, but I wanted you to want to live with me, but okay, if you're\nhaving so much fun over here\xc2\x85"
Rachel	 Oh, it's so much more fun with you."
Phoebe	 We did have fun, didn't we?"
Rachel	 We did!'
Phoebe	 Oh, anyway, they say, if we want, we can see it tonight.'
Rachel	 Oh, I would love to!'
Phoebe	 Yay, okay!'
Rachel	 Good, good, good, good, good. (She runs to the drums and gets the\nsticks)'
Phoebe	 Great, all right, okay, and Monica ask me to make the drumming stop.'
Rachel	 (with the sticks in her hands) Um... (She goes to the tarantula-cage and\nputs the sticks into it) Done!'
Ross	 Hey!'
Salesman	 Hello, Sir. You're here to return those pants?"
Ross	 No, these are my pants.'
Salesman	 Oh. Okay! How can I help you?'
Ross	 Well, uh, do you have a Santa-outfit left?'
Salesman	 Two days before Christmas? Sorry, man.'
Ross	 Okay look, do-do, you have anything Christmassy? I promised my son, and I\nreally don't want to disappoint him, um, come on, I\xc2\x85uh, you gotta have something."
Ross	 I'm the holiday armadillo! I'm a friend of Santa's and he sent me here to\nwish you (Points to Ben) a Merry Christmas!"
Monica	 What happened to Santa, Holiday Armadillo?'
Ross	 (to Monica) Santa was unavailable so close to Christmas.'
Monica	 Wow, come in, have a seat. You must be exhausted coming all the way\nfrom\xc2\x85Texas.'
Ben	 Texas?'
Ross	 That's right, Ben. I'm Santa's representative for all the southern states.\nAnd Mexico! But, Santa sent me here to give you these presents, Ben. (He tries to bend\ndown to pick up the bag with the presents, but can't because of the costume) Maybe the\nLady will help me with these presents."
Ben	 Wow! Thanks!'
Ross	 You're welcome, Ben. Merry Christmas, ooh, and Happy Hanukkah!"
Ben	 Are you for Hanukkah, too? Because I'm part-Jewish."
Ross	 (gasps) You are? Me, too!'
Monica	 Because Armadillos also wandered in the desert?'
Ross	 (to Monica) You wanna wander in the hall? (to Ben) Ooh, hey Ben, what if\nthe Holiday Armadillo told you all about the festival of lights?'
Ben	 Cool!'
Ross	 Yeah!'
Monica	 Come on Ben.'
Ross	 Years and years ago there were these people called the Maccabees...'
Chandler	 (entering in a Santa costume) Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas!'
Ben	 Santa! (Runs to Chandler and hugs him)'
Chandler	 Hey! (Grunts as Ben hits him at full speed.)'
Ross	 What are you doing here, Santa?'
Chandler	 Well, I'm here to see my old buddy Ben. What are you doing here,\nweird\xc2\x85turtle-man?"
Ross	 I'm the Holiday Armadillo, your part-Jewish friend. You sent me here to\ngive Ben some presents. Remember?"
Chandler	 What?'
Ben	 Did you bring me any presents, Santa?'
Chandler	 You bet I did, Ben, put it there! (He shakes Ben's hand, but the money\nfalls out of his hands) (to Monica) Well, it would have worked this time, if his hands\nweren't so damn small! (Realizes, that Ben is standing right there) Ho, ho, ho!"
Monica	 Okay Ben, why don't you come open some more presents, and Santa, the\nArmadillo, and I have a little talk in the kitchen? There's a sentence, I never thought\nI'd say."
Ross	 (to Chandler) What are you doing?'
Chandler	 You called everyone and said you were having trouble finding a Santa\ncostume, so I borrowed one from a guy at work!'
Ross	 Thank you, but, but you gotta leave.'
Chandler	 Why?'
Ross	 Because, I'm finally getting him excited about Hanukkah, and, and\nyou're-you\xc2\x92re wrecking it."
Chandler	 But I didn't get to shape my belly like a bowl full of jelly."
Ross	 I'm sorry, Chandler but this, this is really important to me."
Chandler	 Fine, I'll give the suit back."
Monica	 (to Chandler) Hey, you think, you can keep it another night? (She has a\nreally teasing look on her face and keeps twirling Chandler's beard.)"
Chandler	 Santa? Really?'
Monica	 Yes, is that okay?'
Chandler	 Did your Dad ever dress up like Santa?'
Monica	 No.'
Chandler	 Then it's okay! (They kiss.)"
Ross	 Okay Ben, Santa has to go. Say good-bye!'
Ben	 No! Why does he have to go?'
Chandler	 Because, if Santa and the Holiday\xc2\x85Armadillo? (Ross nods) ...are\never in the same room for too long the universe will implode. Merry Christmas!'
Ben	 No! Why can't the Armadillo leave? I want Santa!"
Ross	 Fine, I-I give up. Santa, Santa can stay.'
Chandler	 Well, I'll stay, but only because I wanna hear about Hanukkah. Ben,\nwill you sit here with Santa and learn about Hanukkah?"
Ben	 Okay, Santa!'
Ross	 All right, it's time for the story of Hanukkah. Years and years ago, there\nwere these people called the Maccabees."
Joey	 (entering wearing a Superman costume) Merry Christmas!'
Rachel	 Oh wow! Look at this place!'
Phoebe	 Oh, this is terrible. Oh, they\xc2\x92ve made so many changes I can\xc2\x92t\neven feel my grandmother\xc2\x92s presence anymore\xc2\x97Ooh! New sconces!'
Rachel	 (yelling from another room) Oh my God!'
Phoebe	 What?'
Rachel	 (returning) Okay, remember uh, remember how you told me that your\ngrandmother put up that wall to make that into two bedrooms?'
Phoebe	 Yeah?'
Rachel	 And remember how you always said you were afraid the landlord would find\nout and then tear it down?'
Phoebe	 Yeah?'
Rachel	 Do you really not know where I\xc2\x92m going with this? (Phoebe nods,\n"No.") It left! It\xc2\x92s one huge room!'
Phoebe	 Oh no! (She runs to see.) (Running back, excitedly) Oh! Wow!!!'
Rachel	 See?'
Phoebe	 Well, I guess we\xc2\x92ll just have to put the wall back up.'
Rachel	 You can\xc2\x92t, because of the new skylight!'
Phoebe	 There\xc2\x92s a skylight?! (Runs to see and yells from the bedroom.)\nWow!!'
Rachel	 So what should we do? Should we start looking for a new place?'
Phoebe	 (returning slowly) Y\xc2\x92know I\xc2\x92m-I\xc2\x92m sensing that um, my\ngrandmother would not be comfortable with that.'
Rachel	 Oh yeah? Startin\xc2\x92 to feel her again there are we?'
Phoebe	 A little bit, yeah.'
Rachel	 Pheebs is your grandmother maybe saying that you should live here alone?'
Phoebe	 You heard her too?! You have the gift!'
Rachel	 Phoebe, it\xc2\x92s okay. I like living with Joey.'
Phoebe	 Are you sure?'
Rachel	 Oh please, I hate packing, it\xc2\x92s closer to work, and we do have fun.\nAlthough, I\xc2\x92m really gonna miss living with you.'
Phoebe	 Oh me too.'
Rachel	 I know. (They hug.) Oh-oh, wait did you hear that-hear that? Listen,\nI\xc2\x92m gettin\xc2\x92 something from your grandmother, she said that since you get to keep\nthe one bedroom apartment you should give Rachel the purple chair?'
Phoebe	 No, I do not hear that.'
Ross	 \xc2\x85and the miracle was that that little bit of oil that should\xc2\x92ve\njust lasted just one day, burned for\xc2\x85'
Ben	 (answering him) Eight whole days.'
Ross	 That\xc2\x92s right, and that\xc2\x92s why we celebrate Hanukkah today. The\nend.'
Ben	 Awesome!'
Ross	 Yeah?'
Chandler	 My favorite part was when Superman flew all the Jews out of\nEgypt. (Glaring at Joey who\xc2\x92s nodding.)'
Ross	 The Armadillo was actually not so thrilled about that part! Okay\nBen, it\xc2\x92s time to light the Hanukkah candles! (Santa, Superman, Monica, Ben,\nand the Holiday Armadillo go over to the menorah to light the candles.)'
Rachel	 (entering with Phoebe) Hey! '
Phoebe	 Oh.'
Rachel	 (seeing the collection of characters.) Wow! It looks like the Easter\nBunny\xc2\x92s funeral in here.'
Ross	 Come on, come on, we\xc2\x92re-we\xc2\x92re-we\xc2\x92re lighting the candles!'
Rachel	 Oh.'
Phoebe	 Oh.'
Phoebe	 Okay, I understand why Superman is here, but why is there a\nporcupine at the Easter Bunny\xc2\x92s funeral?'

Rachel	 I got it!'
Joey	 (yelling from the bedroom) Is it back in the cage?'
Rachel	 Its back in cage!'
Joey	 Cage closed?'
Rachel	 Joey, would you just come out here and stop being such a baby!'
