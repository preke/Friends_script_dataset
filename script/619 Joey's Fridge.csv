Joey	 Well that thing is clearing in the way! All right. Ah-ha! (He grabs a\nscrewdriver and starts to attack the compressor, only he causes a small short circuit and\nshocks himself.) Ah-ah!! Damn fridge! '
Rachel	 Hi Joey, how ya doin\xc2\x92?'
Joey	 Great! Roomie!'
Rachel	 Huh, yeah I guess we are roommates now.'
Joey	 Yeah! Well, now that you brought it up, our fridge is broken. We have to\nget a new one. Now, I checked around and your half is $400. Thanks a lot.'
Rachel	 I\xc2\x92m not paying for half of that! I\xc2\x92m only staying here until\nmy apartment gets fixed.'
Joey	 Look Rach, my parents bought this fridge just after I was born, okay? Now,\nI have never had a problem with it. Then you show up and it breaks! What does that\ntell ya\xc2\x92?'
Rachel	 That refrigerators don\xc2\x92t live as long as people.'
Joey	 All right, now you know that the ATM will only lets you take out 300 at a\ntime, I\xc2\x92ll take a check for the other hundred.'
Rachel	 You\xc2\x92re jokin\xc2\x92 right?'
Joey	 Of course I\xc2\x92m jokin\xc2\x92! I don\xc2\x92t take checks.'
Rachel	 Thank God you\xc2\x92re pretty. (Exits.)'

Rachel	 Hey!'
All	 Hi! Hey!'
Rachel	 Do you guys know any cute guys?'
Chandler	 Well, of course I do! My good friend Joey over here. (Pats Joey\xc2\x92s\narm, Joey pats Chandler\xc2\x92s shoulder, and Chandler motions for Joey to say the same\nabout him.)'
Joey	 Oh, I\xc2\x92m sorry. Thank you Chandler.'
Rachel	 Anyway, there\xc2\x92s this big charity ball this weekend and Ralph Lauren\nbought a table, so I kinda have to go\xc2\x85'
Monica	 What\xc2\x92s the charity?'
Rachel	 I don\xc2\x92t know, something either trees or disease\xc2\x97Ralph mumbles\na lot.'
Monica	 Does Ralph mumble when you\xc2\x92re not paying attention?'
Rachel	 Yeah! It\xc2\x92s weird. But the thing is need to find a date.'
Phoebe	 Well, what kind of guy are you looking for?'
Rachel	 Well, someone that has his own tux, or has the ability to rent a\ntux.'
Chandler	 So he has to be a male who has at least $50.'
Joey	 Ooh! So close.'
Ross	 Hey everybody!'
All	 Hi!'
Ross	 Hey uh, this is Elizabeth.'
Elizabeth	 Oh hi!'
All	 Hi!'
Elizabeth	 I\xc2\x92m the student.'
Chandler	 (laughs) Isn\xc2\x92t she cute? (On Monica\xc2\x92s death stare) No!'
Phoebe	 Y\xc2\x92know, this is probably none of my business, but weren\xc2\x92t you\nguys supposed to not be seen in public together?'
Elizabeth	 Oh, we\xc2\x92re not together.'
Ross	 Oh no-no-no, we\xc2\x92re just two people who happen to run into each other\nhere at the coffee house. (He winks at her.)'
Phoebe	 Oh, sly.'
Elizabeth	 Well, I really wanted to meet you guys, but I have to run. I\xc2\x92ll\nsee you later?'
All	 Okay!'
Elizabeth	 Bye Ross.'
Ross	 Bye.'
Elizabeth	 Oops! I did not mean to run into you like that sir.'
Ross	 Oh that is quite all right ma\xc2\x92am. (Elizabeth exits.)'
Chandler	 So, why is she leaving? Is it a school night and she has a lot of\nhomework to do?'
Ross	 Yes, her molecular epidemiology paper is due tomorrow.'
Chandler	 Oh, tell her good luck with that.'
Ross	 Anyone else? Huh? Bring \xc2\x91em on!'
Rachel	 Oo! When\xc2\x92s her birthday?!'
Ross	 I don\xc2\x92t know Rachel, why?'
Rachel	 Well, y\xc2\x92know it\xc2\x92s just been so long since I\xc2\x92ve been to Chuckie\nCheese.'
Monica	 Oh, I like Elizabeth.'
Ross	 Well thanks!'
Monica	 Yeah. In fact, I like her so much you tell her I want my cookies early\nthis year! Y\xc2\x92know, a box of Thin Mints and some Tag-a-Longs.'
Joey	 Hey-hey come on you guys, give him a break. Ross, seriously, how\xc2\x92s it\ngoing with her?'
Ross	 Well, actually it\xc2\x92s been great. She\xc2\x92s 20 so she\xc2\x92s not\nlooking for anything too serious, which is perfect for me right now.'
Monica	 Well that is great. And seriously, she seems very nice.'
Ross	 Thanks. I know you guys like to give me a hard time and all, but it really\nmeans a lot to me that you like her. Just knowing that you guys are\xc2\x85'
Phoebe	 (interrupting) Okay, I got a good one. Okay, umm, what is she? Like 12?'
Monica	 Chandler, do you think we talk about our relationship enough?'
Chandler	 Yeah. Do we have any Fruit Roll-Ups?'
Phoebe	 (entering) Hey!'
Monica	 Hey!'
Phoebe	 Okay, I just thought of the perfect guy for Rachel to take to her thing.'
Chandler	 Oh that\xc2\x92s so funny because we found someone too.'
Phoebe	 Oh that\xc2\x92s good, I guess she\xc2\x92ll have a choice between my guy\nand your weirdo.'
Chandler	 Why would our guy be a weirdo?'
Phoebe	 \xc2\x91Cause that\xc2\x92s just your taste.'
Monica	 (laughs sarcastically) Rachel is not going to pick your stupid guy.'
Phoebe	 Oh yeah?'
Monica	 Yeah!'
Phoebe	 My guy is a lawyer who has volunteer work. And, he has one of these (She\nsqueezes the skin on her chin together to form\xc2\x85)'
Chandler	 A face ass?'
Phoebe	 A chin dimple!'
Monica	 Well, uh y\xc2\x92know, our guy works with Chandler and he\xc2\x92s really\nnice and smart and he\xc2\x92s a great dresser!'
Phoebe	 Have you seen your guy\xc2\x92s body?'
Chandler	 No, our guy is just a floating head.'
Phoebe	 Well my guy is spectacular. Okay? He\xc2\x92s a massage client and one\ntime umm, when he was on the table, I looked at it. And I mean all of it.'
Monica	 You\xc2\x92re not supposed to look!'
Phoebe	 Oh yeah, like there are police for that!'
Chandler	 (horrified) Wait! You look? You-you massaged me.'
Phoebe	 I know. (Laughs.)'
Monica	 All right fine, your guy may have a great body, but our guy is really\nfunny.'
Phoebe	 Oh, Chandler funny?'
Monica	 Our guy\xc2\x92s a great dancer!'
Phoebe	 My guy is well read.'

Chandler	 Our guy smells incredible.'
Monica	 (To Chandler) Do you want our guy to be your guy?'
Chandler	 Hey.'
Joey	 Huh.'
Chandler	 Well, you\xc2\x85don\xc2\x92t look good Joe.'
Joey	 The fridge broke. I have to eat everything. Cold cuts, ice cream,\nlimes\xc2\x97Hey, what was in that brown jar?'
Chandler	 That\xc2\x92s still in there?!'
Joey	 Not anymore. So anyway, how do you want to pay me?'
Chandler	 Is this a service you\xc2\x92re providing me?'
Joey	 No! No! No! For my new fridge\xc2\x97our new fridge!'
Chandler	 Our new fridge? I don\xc2\x92t live here anymore.'
Joey	 So what? Look, suppose we were a divorced couple.'
Chandler	 Uh-huh.'
Joey	 And I got custody of the kid, right? Now suppose the kid dies and-and I\ngotta buy a new kid.'
Chandler	 (not quite sure where Joey\xc2\x92s going and is a little worried)\nOkay\xc2\x85'
Joey	 (pause) Give me $400!'
Elizabeth	 Professor Geller?'
Ross	 Hmm? (Turns around and sees that its Elizabeth) Oh, a student I don\xc2\x92t\nknow.'
Elizabeth	 I was wondering if I could talk to you for a moment?'
Ross	 Yes, yes of course, what-what would this be regarding?'
Elizabeth	 Making out in your office.'
Ross	 Shh! (Laughs then composes himself) Of course, why don\xc2\x92t we go\ninside?'
Ross	 Oh-ooh!'
Elizabeth	 What?'
Ross	 Doorknob! Doorknob!'
Elizabeth	 Oh! Sorry! Umm, I actually do need to talk to you.'

Ross	 Spring vacation.'
Elizabeth	 Yeah, we have time off and a lot of people are going on trips\xc2\x85'
Professor Feesen	 Professor Geller!'
Ross	 (quickly jumping away from Elizabeth) Yes, professor\nFeesen-sen-stenlger\xc2\x85 I\xc2\x92ll be with you in one moment. (To Elizabeth) So, I will\ntake one box of the Thin Mints. (And he ushers Elizabeth out of the office.)'
Ross	 You don\xc2\x92t understand! Elizabeth was about to ask me to go on a trip\nwith her! Is that taking it slow?! No, I\xc2\x92m not ready for this! Okay? What-what do I\ntell her?'
Chandler	 Just tell her the truth! Tell her you\xc2\x92re not ready.'
Ross	 I can do that. Oh-oh, what if she gets upset?'
Chandler	 Then you distract her with a Barbie doll.'
Joey	 Or! You can just, y\xc2\x92know\xc2\x85 (He walks up close to whisper in\nRoss\xc2\x92s ear and when he gets there he pushes Ross into the fridge.)'
Ross	 What the hell are you doing?'
Joey	 What? What the hell am I doing? You just broke my fridge!'
Ross	 What?! What? How do you, how do you even know its broken?!'
Joey	 Oh-ho-ho, you think I don\xc2\x92t know what breaks my fridge? Excuse me!\n(He opens the door and feels inside.) Well what do you know! Broken! That\xc2\x92ll be $400!'
Chandler	 Joey, I saw you push him!'
Joey	 (pause) You pushed him!'
Ross	 Joey, I did not break this! Okay? (He opens the freezer and smells inside\nand recoils in disgust.) That has been broken for a while.'
Joey	 All right. Chandler, do you remember how I told you about our fridge?'
Chandler	 Uh-huh.'
Joey	 I still haven\xc2\x92t gotten a check for your half yet.'
Ross	 Do not give him any money!'
Joey	 I\xc2\x92m not talking to you! You broke my fridge!'
Elizabeth	 You wanted to see me Professor Geller?'
Ross	 Yes. Yes! Please, come in.'
Ross	 Oo-oo!'
Elizabeth	 Doorknob?'
Ross	 Yeah, it kinda grows on you. (They both laugh.) Actually, I wanted to\nfinish talking to you about uh, spring vacation.'
Elizabeth	 Oh good.'
Ross	 Look, I\xc2\x85 (He has trouble sitting in his chair.) Look, I\xc2\x92m having\na great time with you and I just don\xc2\x92t want us to move to fast or put to much\npressure on us. So, I\xc2\x92m sorry I just don\xc2\x92t think we should go away together yet.\nIt\xc2\x92s-it\xc2\x92s too soon.'
Elizabeth	 Ross, I think you misunderstood what I was saying. I just wanted to\ntell you that I\xc2\x92m going to Florida for a couple weeks.'
Ross	 No. I think you misunderstood what I was saying. What I meant\nwas\xc2\x85'
Elizabeth	 You are so adorable.'
Ross	 That! Let\xc2\x92s talk about that.'
Ross	 Hey!'
Chandler	 Hey!'
Phoebe	 Hey!'
Monica	 Hey! How did it go with Elizabeth?'
Ross	 Huh? Oh-oh, it was fine. Uh, it was just a misunderstanding. She\ndidn\xc2\x92t want me to go with her. She just wanted to let me know that she\xc2\x92s going\nto Florida for spring vacation.'
Chandler	 Wait a minute, is she going for spring vacation or is she going for\nspring break? (Does a little whooping/party noise.)'
Ross	 What\xc2\x92s-what\xc2\x92s the difference?'
Monica	 Well, spring vacation is doing nice things with your grandparents.\nSpring break you\xc2\x92re doing frat guys.'
Ross	 Hey, y\xc2\x92know what? Not all spring breaks are like that.'
Phoebe	 What did you do on yours?'
Ross	 I went to Egypt with my dad.'
Chandler	 I can see it now, "Look dad, it\xc2\x92s the Sphinx!" (Does\nthat party noise again.)'
Ross	 Hey, I think Elizabeth is a little more serious than, "Spring\nbreak!" (Imitates the party noise.) All right? I mean she\xc2\x92s taken my class!'
Monica	 And slept with the professor.'
Ross	 I\xc2\x92m gonna call her.'
Chandler	 Yeah.'
Rachel	 Hey! You guys umm, I want you to meet Sebastian.'
Sebastian	 Hi.'
Rachel	 We just uh, we just met at the newsstand. We both grabbed for the last Field\n& Stream. (Chandler\xc2\x92s shocked.) What? I read that.'
Sebastian	 Can I get you a cup of coffee?'
Rachel	 Oh yes! Thank you! (He does so and Rachel sits down on the couch.)'
Phoebe	 Rachel, what the hell is this?!'
Rachel	 (shocked) What?'
Phoebe	 You ask us to find you a guy and you come traipsing in here with your\nown!'
Rachel	 You found me a guy?'
Monica	 Yes! We found you a really cute and funny guy from Chandler\xc2\x92s work!'
Phoebe	 Yeah and I-I found you one too who is not a weirdo.'
Rachel	 Well, y\xc2\x92know what though you guys? I really appreciate that but I\nthink I\xc2\x92m just gonna take Sebastian to the charity.'
Chandler	 Are you sure?! Because our guy smells incredible!'
Monica	 Uh, would you stop it with that already?!'
Sebastian	 Here you go. (Hands her, her cup.)'
Rachel	 Oh, thank you.'
Sebastian	 Sure.'
Phoebe	 So, Sebastian, do you do any volunteer work?'
Sebastian	 Uh, no not really. Why?'
Phoebe	 No reason, it\xc2\x92s just I know a single guy that cares about other\npeople.'
Chandler	 Are you funny?'
Sebastian	 Excuse me?'
Rachel	 What are you guys doing?'
Monica	 Are you funny? Tell us a joke!'
Sebastian	 Look, I just wanted to have coffee with Rachel.'
Phoebe	 Well, so do a lot of people.'
Sebastian	 Actually, I uh, I gotta get going. (To Rachel) Give me a call\nsometime.'
Rachel	 Oh, but y\xc2\x92know, no, you didn\xc2\x92t give me your phone number.'
Sebastian	 Okay! See you later! (Exits.)'
Chandler	 (To Monica) Turns out he is kinda funny. '

Rachel	 I cannot believe you guys! He was really nice and he left because of\nyou!'
Chandler	 Yeah, but Sebastian? What is that? A cat\xc2\x92s name?'
Phoebe	 Yeah, y\xc2\x92know what I noticed Rachel? He scares easy. Is that the\nkind of guy you\xc2\x92d like to take to a ball? "Hey Sebastian, would you like to\ndance?" (Imitates him.) "Uhh, okay\xc2\x97I gotta go!"'
Monica	 All right guys stop it. Rachel, we\xc2\x92re very sorry that is a very\ninsensitive thing for us to do. And y\xc2\x92know what? Let us make it up to you, we have\ntwo really great guys for you.'
Phoebe	 Yeah! What have you got to lose? Y\xc2\x92know you might even end up with\nsomeone really special (whispers) if you pick my guy.'
Rachel	 All right.'
Chandler	 Okay, so you will meet our guys?'
Rachel	 Yes, I\xc2\x92ll meet \xc2\x91em.'
Chandler	 Okay now it doesn\xc2\x92t matter which one you choose, y\xc2\x92know?\nIt\xc2\x92s completely up to you. Our guy is perfect, or you can go out with the guy Phoebe\ndeemed not good enough to go out with herself.'
Joey	 (entering) Pheebs! There you are! Okay, you broke my fridge; you owe me\n400 bucks!'
Phoebe	 Okay sure!'
Joey	 Really?!'
Phoebe	 Ooh, technically you owe me $600 for sending out happy thoughts on your\nlast ten auditions.'
Joey	 Call it even?'
Phoebe	 Okay.'
Chandler	 (To Ross) Well, there you are! So what did Elizabeth say?'
Ross	 Well, it turns out that she is going to Daytona for spring break woo-hoo.\nThat means, that means wet T-shirt contests, guys doing shots off of girl\xc2\x92s bodies,\nwaking up next to people you don\xc2\x92t even know\xc2\x85'
Joey	 Man, she is going to have a great time! Is she staying at the Hotel\nCorona?'
Chandler	 You know the hotels?'
Joey	 Sure! I was there! Spring Break \xc2\x9281! Woo-hoo!'
Monica	 In 1981 you were 13!'
Joey	 So what? I drove down, sold T-shirts, had a blast. And y\xc2\x92know who\nknows how to party? Drunk college chicks.'
Ross	 Okay, she can\xc2\x92t go.'
Phoebe	 Ross, you can\xc2\x92t tell her not to go. You just started dating.'
Ross	 Then what am I supposed to do?'
Phoebe	 Nothing, you just have to be cool with it.'
Ross	 Well, what is she goes down and-and sleeps with a bunch of guys?'
Chandler	 Well, maybe you don\xc2\x92t marry this one.'
Ross	 I\xc2\x92m so glad you\xc2\x92re going on this trip!'
Elizabeth	 Yeah! I\xc2\x92ve been working so hard this semester. I really need to\ngo crazy y\xc2\x92know, blow off some steam.'
Ross	 Sure. Sure. Look I don\xc2\x92t, I don\xc2\x92t know if your plans are\nfinalized yet, but umm, hey I-I know another great way to blow off steam.'
Elizabeth	 What?'
Ross	 Are you into crafts at all?'
Elizabeth	 Ross, are you okay?'
Ross	 Well, yeah, of-of course I\xc2\x92m okay! What? I\xc2\x92m just being\nsupportive. Supportive of you and this whole trip, and-and (notices something) what-what\nis uh, what\xc2\x92s this? (He holds up a rather skimpy bathing suit.)'
Elizabeth	 It\xc2\x92s a bathing suit?'
Ross	 To wear in front of people?'
Elizabeth	 Is that supportive?'
Ross	 Is this?!'
Monica	 Hey!'
Chandler	 Good-good-good-good.'
Monica	 Hey!'
Chandler	 Hey!'
Rachel	 Hi!'
Monica	 We\xc2\x92re really glad you decided to meet our guy.'
Rachel	 Oh\xc2\x85'
Monica	 You\xc2\x92re gonna like him so much. So umm, when do you want to meet\nhim?'
Rachel	 I don\xc2\x92t know. I know I don\xc2\x92t work late tomorrow night.'
Chandler	 Tomorrow night is good. Tomorrow night is good, but uh, y\xc2\x92know\nwhat? Why put off something till tomorrow that you can do right now? (Laughs) Eldad come\nhere! (He stands up from the next table.)'
Rachel	 What?'
Monica	 Eldad, this is Rachel.'
Eldad	 How are you?'
Rachel	 Well-well a little blind sided but y\xc2\x92know good.'
Chandler	 Eldad, sit down. (To Rachel) Move over! Move over now!'
Rachel	 I\xc2\x97Ohh! (Moves over and lets Eldad sit on the couch.)'
Chandler	 There you go! There you are! (Rachel stares at Monica and Chandler)'
Monica	 Okay! Okay! We can take a hint! (They start to leave but run into Phoebe\nwith her guy in tow.) (To Phoebe) What are you doing here?!'
Phoebe	 This is Patrick. (Points to him.)'
Patrick	 Hi.'
Chandler	 Hi. (To Phoebe) Okay, you\xc2\x92re too late okay? Because she\xc2\x92s\nalready with our guy.'
Phoebe	 (looks) Oh my God, you\xc2\x92re right! I am too late; they\xc2\x92re\nsitting on the couch and talking! (To Patrick) Come on! (They go over to the couch.)\nRachel?'
Rachel	 Yeah?'
Phoebe	 This is Patrick.'
Rachel	 Oh, hi.'
Patrick	 Hi.'
Phoebe	 Yeah, this is the guy I was telling you about. '
Rachel	 Yeah?'
Phoebe	 Yeah. And believe me, this suit does not do justice to what\xc2\x92s\nunderneath it.'
Rachel	 Oh-okay, but Pheebs?'
Phoebe	 Yeah?'
Rachel	 I\xc2\x92m just sort of in the middle of something.'
Phoebe	 Oh! Okay! Yeah, that\xc2\x92s okay. (To Patrick) Have a seat. (Sits\nPatrick down next to Rachel.)'
Monica	 No! You can\xc2\x92t do that!'
Eldad	 Maybe I should go!'
Monica	 (stopping him) Sit down! We\xc2\x92re winning!'
Rachel	 Okay, y\xc2\x92know what? Maybe I should go!'
All	 (Chandler stops her) No-no-no-no! Have a seat! Have a seat!'
Monica	 Rachel! Rachel! You haven\xc2\x92t touched Eldad\xc2\x92s hair!'
Chandler	 It is the softest hair! Touch it! (Both he and Monica do so.)'
Rachel	 Yeah, I\xc2\x92m good.'
Phoebe	 Rachel? Patrick is really rich. (To Patrick) Give her some money.'
Patrick	 Y\xc2\x92know what Phoebe? This isn\xc2\x92t really worth the free massage.'
Monica	 That\xc2\x92s right Patrick, bye-bye!'
Chandler	 (To Rachel) Eldad is much more cooperative! And he can dance! (To\nEldad) You dance for Rachel!'
Rachel	 No-no! Don\xc2\x92t dance for me! Please? Don\xc2\x92t! (She gets up to yell\nat her \xc2\x91friends.\xc2\x92) What is the matter with you guys?'
Phoebe	 Yeah, okay, let\xc2\x92s talk it out.'
Rachel	 I\xc2\x85 Am I the only one that this is embarrassing for?'
Eldad	 I\xc2\x92m a little embarrassed. (Chandler shushes him.)'
Rachel	 I\xc2\x92ll tell ya who should be embarrassed! It\xc2\x92s you guys! Come\non! This is ridiculous! Thank you very much, but I do not need you to get me a date!'
Phoebe	 Then why did she ask us to\xc2\x85'
Rachel	 I am still talking!! And then you chase away the one guy that I actually\nliked! I mean, no offense to you guys. Really! I mean (To Patrick) congratulations on all\nthe cash, (He nods) and-and y\xc2\x92know\xc2\x97(Feels Eldad\xc2\x92s hair)\xc2\x97Wow! You do\nhave very soft hair! But I would much rather go to the ball all by myself than go through\nanymore of this! Good-bye! (Grabs her stuff, starts to leave, then turns back suddenly,\nand to Eldad) Now do you use some sort of special conditioner on that hair?!'
Eldad	 Yes, Papaya Extract.'
Rachel	 Thank you! (Storms out.)'
Ross	 So uh, have a great time down there.'
Elizabeth	 I will.'
Ross	 Yeah. And did you, did you pack that bathing suit?'
Elizabeth	 Yeah.'
Ross	 It was pretty funny when I, when I hid it for a while, huh? Anyway, umm,\nI-I am worried about that bathing suit, not because it\xc2\x92s revealing which I\xc2\x92m\nfine with, no I\xc2\x92m concerned about your health, sun exposure.'
Elizabeth	 Oh, don\xc2\x92t worry I have plenty of sun block, it\xc2\x92s SPF-30.'
Ross	 Well, if what\xc2\x92s in the bottle is actually 30. I mean sometimes you\nget 30, sometimes it\xc2\x92s-it\xc2\x92s get 4, and I swear to God more often than not\nit\xc2\x92s just milk.'
Elizabeth	 Ross, it\xc2\x92s going to be okay. I\xc2\x92m not going down there to\nhook up with a bunch of guys. I really like you. I like how things are going between us.'
Ross	 Really?'
Elizabeth	 Yeah! I\xc2\x92m just going down there to relax and hang out with my\nfriends.'
Ross	 Okay. Cool.'
Elizabeth	 Oh hey! Here they are!'
Guy	 Elizabeth!'
Ross	 Call me!'

Phoebe	 Rachel, we\xc2\x92re sorry for pushing those guys on you.'
Rachel	 Oh that\xc2\x92s all right! Y\xc2\x92know, I ended up having a really good\ntime. Y\xc2\x92know, the charity was a big success and they raised a lot of money and\nawareness.'
Chandler	 So what was it for anyway?'
Rachel	 I wanna say a disease.'
Joey	 (entering) Hey!'
All	 Hey!'
Joey	 I just got this really weird message from Ross. He said turn on MTV.'
Rachel	 Huh. All right.'
Phoebe	 Oh my God, look! That\xc2\x92s Elizabeth!'
Rachel	 Oh-oh Professor Geller.'
Joey	 Ahh, to be 13 again.'
Chandler	 Yeah.'
