Monica	 Hey Hon, could you help me get the plates down?'
Chandler	 Yeah. Hey, here's an idea, why don't we use our\n  wedding china today?"
Monica	 No, I think we should save our china for something\n  really special. Like if the Queen of England comes over.'
Chandler	 Honey, she keeps canceling on us, take the hint. '
Monica	 What if something gets broken, they're so expensive. "
Chandler	 What is the point of having them if we never use\n  them?'
Monica	 Ok, but if something gets broken, and then the Queen\n  comes over..'
Chandler	 I will explain it to her.'
Monica	 <laughs> Oh yeah, like I'm going to let you\n  talk to the queen. "
Joey	 wow, the parade is really good this year. Man those\n  horses can crap. '
TV announcer	 Next up is a marching band from Muskogee, OK.'
Chandler	 Muskogee! That's like four hours from Tulsa. Woo\n  hoo!\n  TV announcer
Joey	 Oh my God!'
Chandler	 Aren't you one of the stars of the popular daytime\n  soap Days of Our Lives? "
Joey	 Yeah! I totally forgot I'm supposed to be there. I\n  can't believe I forgot. I usually write stuff like this on my arm. "
Chandler	 What are you going to do?'
Joey	 I guess I\'m going to have to come up with a really\n  good reason why I wasn\'t there. The producers are going to be so mad at me.\n  They sat us all down yesterday and said "Everyone has to be there at 6
Chandler	 Well you proved them wrong.'

Ross	 A lot of people are thankful for those.\n< knock on door> '
Woman at door	 Hello? Rachel? '
Rachel	 Who is it? '
Woman at door	 It's your favorite sister."
Rachel	 Hide my rings.'
Rachel	 Oh. <opens door preparing herself and then happily\n  says> \n  Amy! Happy Thanksgiving.'
Amy	 Do you have a hair straightener? '
Rachel	 Um... hi.'
Amy	 oh... hi.. <goes to Rachel with open arms>'
Rachel	 Aw. '
Amy	 Hair Straightener?'
Rachel	 I haven't seen you in like.. a year."
Amy	 Oh, I know, I know. I've just been crazed."
Rachel	 Oh well yeah me too. Um.. I had a baby. '
Amy	 I decorated Dad's office. "
Rachel	 Oh.. yeah? Well unless you pushed a desk out of your\n  vagina, <shakes head no> not the same thing.'
Amy	 Listen, um about the hair straightener, honey.. I really\n  need one. I'm going to have dinner at my boyfriend's house. "
Amy	 Oh my God!'
Rachel	 mh hmm.. '
Amy	 Is this Emmett? <pointing to EMMA>'
Rachel	 Uh.... its Emma.'
Amy	 Its a girl?'
Ross	 Hey Amy. '
Rachel	 Oh Amy, you remember Ross.'
Amy	 Not really. But you are much cuter then that geeky guy\n  she used to date.'
Ross	 That was me.'
Amy	 No, he was this creepy guy from high school who had\n  this huge crush on her since like the ninth grade. '
Amy	 No, I'm not talking about you. <to Rachel> It\n  was your fat \n  friends brother with that bad afro, do you remember?"
Monica	 Careful. <hands Chandler a china plate> Careful.\n  CAREFUL! '
Chandler	 I'll tell you what, for the rest of our lives,\n  I'll be careful until told otherwise. <looks at china> hey wait a minute\n  this isn't the china we picked out.. "
Monica	 I know, after you left the store, I chose different\n  ones.'
Chandler	 Why?'
Monica	 well no offense honey, but your taste is a little\n  feminine for me.'
Chandler	 Oh suddenly, flowers are feminine?\n< Phoebe comes in>'
Phoebe	 Hey, everybody. Happy Thanksgiving!'
Joey	 Hey happy Thanksgiving.. Pheebs! <motions her to\n  come over> '
Phoebe	 Hey, what's going on Joe? "
Joey	 I.. I.. I need a good lie.'
Phoebe	 Oh okay. How about the whole "man walking on\n  the moon" thing. You know? You. you could. You could see the strings people! '
Joey	 No, no, no I need a good lie to explain why I wasn't\n  at a work thing today."
Phoebe	 Ooh, honey. You stink at lying. '
Joey	 I do not.'
Phoebe	 Oh really. Okay. let me ask you something. Yesterday\n  at the coffee house, I went to the bathroom and when I came back, my muffin\n  was gone-who took it?'
Joey	 Somebody opened the door to the coffee house and a\n  raccoon came running in, went straight for your muffin and I said "Hey\n  don\'t eat that-that\'s Phoebe\'s" and he said.. <pause> He said.. "Joey\n  you stink at lying." What am I going to do? '
Phoebe	 Don't worry, don't worry. We'll come up with a good\n  lie. I'll help you practice it."
Joey	 Oh great, that'd be great. Thank you. "
Phoebe	 Sure, what.. what was the work thing? '
Joey	 Uh.. <forgetting what the work thing was, rolls\n  up his sleeve on his right arm and shows Phoebe, she looks>'
Phoebe	 "Pick up grandma at the airport"?'
Joey	 Oh.. man..'
Rachel	 Amy! <pause> Yes I do.. I really do. <grabs\n  Ross' hand for support>"
Amy	 Hello? Yeah, um. Hang on one sec. <to Ross and Rachel> Can\n  I take this upstairs? '
Ross	 Sure, we don't live there but..."
Amy	 Seriously? Its.. its just these rooms? <moves hands\n  around motioning 'just these rooms'> <To Ross> I thought you were\n  a doctor. "
Rachel	 Yeah, no. Ross has a PhD.'
Amy	 Ew. <walks into Rachel's room, I'm guessing>"
Rachel	 God she is unbelievable.'
Ross	 I know, I mean a PhD is just as good as an MD.'
Rachel	 Oh sure Ross, yeah. If I have a heart attack in a\n  restaurant, I want you there with your fossil brush. '
Rachel	 What? What happened? '
Amy	 My boyfriend canceled on me. I mean.. I I finally find\n  a real relationship. I mean, someone that I can spend this day with and then\n  his wife comes back into town. I swear, its almost not worth dating married\n  guys. '
Ross	 Don't say that."
Amy	 Oh. I was so looking forward to this. It was going to\n  be such a beautiful Thanksgiving. We were going to have sushi. '
Rachel	 Oh Amy, don't cry Amy.\xc2\xa0 Um.. Ross, could I talk\n  to you in private?"
Ross	 Sure, you want to go upstairs?'
Rachel	 Um look I was thinking.. If its ok with Monica I\n  would like to invite Amy to Thanksgiving.'
Ross	 You know, I think thats a great idea. It'll be like\n  the pilgrims bringing the Indians syphilis."
Rachel	 Look I know she's a little tough to take. She has\n  no where else to go, and she's my sister. Alright, she's Emma's aunt. And I\n  would like them to bond. "
Ross	 Ok, fine, but I don't want them bonding to much. I\n  don't want her telling Emma she needs a nose job. "
Rachel	 Ross, you know what? She may need one..We're just\n  going to have to make our peace with that! "
Rachel	 Hey you guys, this is my sister Amy.\xc2\xa0 This is\n  Chandler, Joey, Phoebe and you know Mon. '
Amy	 Oh my god. You're on Days of Our Lives. "
Amy	 wow. They must put a lot of makeup on you. '
Ross to Monica	 Hi.'
Monica to Ross	 Hi.'
Monica to Amy	 So. Welcome. Is this your first time you're\n  seeing Emma? "
Amy	 Oh. That's a funny noise. "
Joey	 Pheebs, I still need some help here'
Phoebe	 Oh right, ok um. Ok so its not just the lie you tell.\n  but its the way you tell it. . For example if you look down at the ground when\n  you're talking, people know you're lying. "
Joey	 Oh.. I don't know why this is so hard for me. you know..\n  I mean lying is basically just acting and I am a terrfic actor. "
Rachel	 Oh we just put her down for a nap.'
Amy	 Oh I was just thinking. You know what would be incredible?\n  If you guys died. '
Amy	 no, no, then I would get the baby. I mean you know it\n  would be just like a movie. Like at first I wouldn't know what to do with her,\n  then I would rise to the occasion and and then I would get a makeover and then\n  I'd get married. "
Phoebe	 Thats a great movie. <she claps>'
Amy	 Now listen, not that you guys could stop me or anything\n  cause you know you'd be dead. I was thinking about changing her name. I'm just\n  not really a big fan of Emily. [Transcriber note
Ross	 Emma. '
Amy turns around to Phoebe	 Emma, Ross wants you. '
Phoebe	 PHOE-BE.'
Amy turns to Ross and Rachel	 Why does she keep making that\n  noise? '
Rachel	 Honey, I don't know how to tell you this, but um,\n  if something were to happen to Ross or to myself <Ross and Rachel knock\n  on wood> um you wouldn't get the baby. "
Amy	 Well who would?'
Ross	 Well we haven't offically asked them yet, but we would\n  want Monica and Chandler. "
Chandler	 I can't believe you'd want us to raise Emma. "
Monica	 yeah oh my god, I'm so moved. "
Amy	 I don't believe this, hold on a second. You guys die\n  and I don't get your baby? "
Rachel	 See look Amy, we're a lot closer to Monica and Chandler.\n  We see them every day. And truthfully honey, you don't seem very connected\n  to the baby."
Amy	 Connected? I mean.. to what? She's.. she's\xc2\xa0 a lump. "
Chandler	 You know, guys I got to say. This means so much\n  to me. That you would trust me with your child. I mean, we all know that Monica\n  and I have been trying to have a baby of our own. You know I've had my doubts\n  about my skills as a father, but that you two.. that you two.... <starts\n  to cry>"
Amy	 <points to Chandler> This guy? Seriously? '
Monica	 Okay! It's time for dinner. Everyone we're using\n  our fancy china.. um and its very expensive so please be careful."
Monica	 Okay, just to be clear comedy with the plates will\n  not be well recieved. <pinches Ross' arm>"
Joey	 Hey! How come my plate's less fancy then everyone else's?\n  Do you not trust me with a fancy plate? "
Monica	 No, honey, its. thats a special plate.\xc2\xa0 See\n  its a game, whoever gets that plate wins. '
Joey	 I can't believe I won."
Amy	 Its such a slap in the face. I'm your sister and you\n  would give your baby to these strangers over me."
Rachel	 Monica is Ross' sister. "
Amy	 No, Ross' sister was really fat. "
Monica	 That was me. '
Amy	 No, she was this really dorky girl in high school that\n  used to follow Rachel around like a puppy dog. '
Rachel	 Hey. Amy. You've got to stop doing that."
Monica	 Now see, this way you protect the plate.. and lets\n  face it you have fun. '
Amy	 Okay, how about this, you guys die and the crazy plate\n  lady dies, then do I get the baby?'
Chandler	 No, if crazy plate lad.. <sees Monica frustrated\n  at this comment> If Monica dies then I would get Emma, Right?'
Rachel	 Well actually...'
Chandler	 Actually what? '
Ross	 well.. its just. its just in that case, then um. Emma\n  would go to my parents. '
Chandler	 What?'
Amy	 Hurts, doesn't it? "
Chandler	 So if Monica's not around, then I'm not good enough\n  to raise Emma? "
Joey	 Yeah he's lying. He looked down. "
Chandler	 Well what is wrong with me? Am I .. am I incomptent?\n  Because I managed to survive whatever it is that killed the three of you! '
Rachel	 Honey, you're taking this the wrong way. We think\n  you're going to be a wonderful parent. It's just.. you're more the fun parent. "
Ross	 Yeah and we'd want to make sure Emma has someone like\n  Monica who is more uh. uh discliplinarin.. someone who can be firm and strict. "
Monica	 Thats not how you see me, is it? '
Chandler	 Look, I may not know a lot about babies, but do\n  you really think I'm not capable? "
Ross	 No, you both are equally capable. Its just.. you're\n  strongest when.. when you're together. "
Chandler	 Ok. So if we both had Emma and I die <knocks\n  on table>\xc2\xa0 she'd have to give her up. "
Ross	 Sure, Monica would have to give her up. '
Joey	 I lie better then that, right?'
Chandler	 So.. let me get this straight. So my two friends\n  die, I get Emma. Then my wife dies, then Emma the one tiny ray of hope left\n  in my life gets taken away from me?'
Phoebe	 There's your movie! <claps> "
Monica	 Hey. There you are. You disappeared after dinner. '
Chandler	 Oh? Did somebody miss me? Is there a child to raise\n  poorly? '
Monica	 Ross and Rachel don't know what they're talking about.\n  I mean its not like their so responsible. Emma is a product of a bottle of\n  Merlot and a five year old condom. "
Chandler	 Yeah but they're right. I mean, I'm not a strong\n  father figure and I never will be. "
Monica	 No you learn these things. You grow into it.'
Chandler	 Yeah, but its not who I am. Everything they said\n  was exaclty why I was worried about having a kid. And its true. And look everybody\n  knows it. '
Monica	 I don't know it! I want to have a kid with you because\n  I think you're going to be an amazing dad... at the fun parts and the hard\n  parts. "
Chandler	 Oh yeah, well can you picture me saying "Go\n  to your room! You\'re grounded"? '
Monica	 Can you hear me say "You\'re grounded"?'
Chandler	 You said that to me last week. '
Monica	 How hard is it? No shoes on the furniture. '
Phoebe	 It's ok. I thought of the perfect lie for you. It's\n  easy to remember and doesn't invite a lot of questions. You weren't at the\n  parade because you had a family emergency. "
Joey	 Oh, I like that, yeah. Wasn't at the parade because\n  I had a family emergency."
Phoebe	 Ooh, what happened? '
Phoebe	 No! Nothing with a raccoon. '
Joey	 Arg... Alright, I'll take care of it. <throws hands\n  out in the air>"
Monica	 Oh wait.. What are you doing? '
Joey	 Setting the table. '
Phoebe	 Yeah we thought it would be nice to use the fancy\n  china for dessert too. '
Monica	 Oh how nice. Maybe later we can all go blow our noses\n  on my wedding dress. '
Ross	 Hey dude, you okay? Sorry about before.'
Chandler	 Oh no thats okay, you're totally right. I don't\n  know anything about disciplining a child. But it did hurt my feelings and I\n  want you to know that when I die, you don't get Joey. "
Amy walks over to the couch and sits down next to Rachel	 Ucch.\xc2\xa0 <pauses> Uchh <louder\n  this time> In case you hadn't noticed, I'm not talking to you. "
Rachel	 UCHH! <much louder and longer then Amy's>"
Amy	 You know.. this.. this is classic Rachel.'
Rachel	 Yeah.. yeah right.. Remember in high school when\n  I died and didn't give you my baby?"
Amy	 This might be my one chance to have a baby Rachel. I\n  mean, you know that I have been so busy focusing on my carrer. '
Rachel	 What? What carrer? '
Amy	 Um.. I'm a decorator. "
Rachel	 Ok. You decorate dad's office and so now you're a\n  decorator. Okay! I went to the zoo yesterday and now I'm a koala bear. "
Amy	 Why can't you ever be supportive? "
Rachel	 Sup.. You want to talk supportive? You didn't even\n  come and visit me when I was in the hospital having the baby. "
Amy	 Oh. Yeah. Well.. You didn't come see me when I was in\n  the hospital when I was getting my lips done. "
Rachel	 I did the first time! Oh. Oh.. <gets up and walks\n  into the kitchen> And you know what. You want to know why I'm not giving\n  Emily to you."
Ross	 Emma. '
Rachel turns to Ross	 Oh whose side are you on? <back\n  to Amy> I'm not giving you Emma because there is no way you could handle\n  the responibility of a child. "
Amy	 How hard could it be? You do it. '
Joey	 ooh oooh.. '
Amy	 Do you want to know why you don't want\xc2\xa0 me to have\n  the baby? "
Rachel	 uh huh.'
Amy	 Because you don't want me to be happy. You.. you have\n  always been jealous of me. "
Rachel	 Jealous of what? Of your lack of responsiblity? You,\n  your immaturity? Your total disregard of other people's feelings? "
Amy	 Uh.. To name a few.\xc2\xa0 You know.. You know.. You've\n  just always been like this. You just have to have everything. And I couldn't\n  have anything. Like in junior high, when you stole Timmy from me. I mean, do\n  you even realize how much that hurt me? "
Rachel	 Timmy was my boyfriend and you made out with him!'
Amy	 Oh come on, that was 20 years ago. Get over it.'
Rachel	 I cannot, I cannot believe that I invited you here\n  today.'
Amy	 Yeah, well you know what I cannot believe. That my so-called\n  sister, gets a 30% discount from Ralph Lauren and I still have to pay retail.'
Rachel	 ah ha ha. ah ha ha. <evil meancing laughter> It's\n  forty five. "
Amy	 You bitch. You just think you're so perfect. With your\n  new baby and your, your small apartment. <directs this to Ross who in turns\n  throws the towel in his hand down on the table> Well let me tell you something.\n  Your baby isn't even that cute. "
Rachel	 You take that back.'
Amy	 No. '
Rachel	 Take it back!'
Amy	 No! What are you going to do? Make me?'
Rachel	 Heey man, I work out. '
Amy	 So do I.'
Rachel	 I do pilates. '
Amy	 I do yoga.'
Rachel	 Bring it on! '
Monica	 Put the plates in the boxes!! Put the plates in the\n  boxes! '
Rachel	 Did you just push me?'
Amy	 Uh, yeah I think I did. '
Rachel	 Alright. Thats it! <Pushes Amy back> '
Monica screaming at Ross	 Forget the bubblewrap! There isn't\n  time! "
Phoebe	 Oh my god! Shouldn't we stop this?"
Joey	 What? Are you out of your mind? Lets throw some jello\n  on them. '
Rachel	 Ew! Gross. '
Chandler	 Alright! That is it. This is our apartment and\n  you can not behave this way. Now if you can't act your age then you shouldn't\n  be here at all. Now those plates may not be as nice as the pretty pink ones\n  I picked out, but they're very important to Monica. I want you to apologize\n  to her right now. "
Amy	 I'm sorry."
Rachel	 Mon, I'm so sorry. "
Chandler	 Okay. Thats better. Now I want you to both apologize\n  to each other and mean it. '
Chandler	 By the way, that fight was totally arousing. '
Ross	 Dude. Well done. You know what? If I die, and Rachel\n  dies and Monica dies then you can totally take care of Emma. '
Chandler	 Oh yeah? Well thanks. '
Ross	 So, so now do I get Joey?'
Chandler	 Okay, but you should know he eats five times a\n  day and shoves pennies up his nose. '
Rachel	 Are you okay Mon? '
Monica	 uh huh.. I mean these things happen. Its' just a\n  plate. Its not like somebody died. "
Phoebe	 It's all right. You can mourn. "
Joey	 Actually its not pies, its just pie. '
Monica	 I don't care. <pauses and realizes...> Oh my\n  god. I've lost the will to scold. "
Rachel	 Look Amy, it got a little of control..Um.. and I'm\n  sorry. You're my sister and uh.. if it really means that much to you.. "
Amy	 So you're going to give me the baby?"
Rachel	 Uh. No.. I was going to let you use my Ralph Lauren\n  discount. '
Rachel	 She needs changing.'
Chandler	 Oh no no no.. I'll get her. I'm super-compentent\n  and totally responsibile and fourth in line to raise Emma. I'll be right there\n  Emma. Just let me get my trusty diaper bag here. <knocks over the box of\n  china> Well.. what do you know? I guess, I'll be the one who dies first."
Phoebe	 Hey, does Monica know about her broken plates yet?'
Chandler	 Nope...'
Phoebe	 Broke them all, huh?'
Chandler	 Yep...'
Phoebe	 You gonna tell her?'
Chandler	 Nope... (Monica walks in) Hey... so I'm gonna...\n  put the plates back. You know, I think you were right, I don't think we should\n  use these plates again for a looong time."
Monica	 Like only if the queen comes?'
Chandler	 Maybe not even then. (Joey walks in)'
Joey	 Hey! I did it. I called my producer. I told him I had\n  a family emergency, he totally bought it. Thanks for teaching me how to lie\n  Pheebs.'
Phoebe	 No problem! Next week
Monica	 Bye plates!'
Joey	 Oh, you told her you broke all the plates, huh? (Chandler\n  walks back, looking angrily at Joey)'
Monica	 What? Something happened with the plates?'
Joey	 Uhm... (looks down) Yeah... this uhm... raccoon came\n  in...'
