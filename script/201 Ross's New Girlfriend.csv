Phoebe	 Ok, so this is pretty much what\'s happened so far. Ross was in love with\nRachel since, you know, forever, but every time he tried to tell her, something kind of\ngot in the way, like cats, and Italian guys. Finally Chandler was like "forget about\nher" but when Ross was in China on his dig, Chandler let it slip that Ross was in\nlove with Rachel. She was like, "Oh my god." So she went to the airport to meet\nhim when he came back, but what she didn\'t know was, that Ross was getting off the plane\nwith another woman. Uh-Oh! So, that\'s pretty much everything you need to know. But, enough\nabout us. So, how\'ve you been?'

Rachel	 Oh my god. Oh my god. (She decides to make a break for it.) Excuse me.\nMove! Move! Emergency! Excuse me! (She tries climbing over a bench and falls down.) '
Ross	 (seeing her) Rach!'
Rachel	 Oh, there you are! Hi! Oh, so, so, how was China, you? (Hits him with\nthe flowers.)'
Ross	 It was, it was great. Oh, what happened?'
Rachel	 What?'
Ross	 You're bleeding. "
Rachel	 I am? Oh, look at that, yes I am. Enough about me, enough about me, Mr.\nBack from the Orient. Come on. I wanna hear everything! Everything. (Looks at Julie)'
Ross	 Well, where do I start? This is Julie. Julie, this is Rachel.'
Rachel	 These are, these aren't for you. (to Julie) These are for you. (Loudly,\nthinking she can't speak English.) Welcome to our country."
Julie	 (Loudly, proving she can speak English.) Thank you. I'm from New York."
Rachel	 Ok, well, not a problem. We'll just use them to stop the bleeding. Ok.\nBaggage claim? Ok."
Chandler	\xc2\xa0 No way!'
Monica	 I'm telling you, she went to the airport, and she's gonna go for it with\nRoss! "
Phoebe	 Oh my god. This is huge. This is bigger than huge. This is like, all\nright, what's bigger than huge?"
Joey	 Um, this?'
Phoebe	 Yes.'
Monica	 Guys, you got your hair cut.'
Chandler	 Yes, yes, we did, thanks to Vidal Buffay.'
Phoebe	 'Cause, you know, (in that voice) if you don't look good, we don't look\ngood. I love that voice."
Rachel	 (entering, out of breath) Airport, airport. Ross, not alone, Julie, arm\naround her. Cramp, cramp.'
Chandler	 Ok, I think she's trying to tell us something. Quick, get the verbs."
Rachel	 (to Chandler) You, you, you said he liked me. (Ross and Julie enter)\nYou, you slowpokes!'
Ross	 That's all right, Rach, we got the bags. Hi, hello. Julie, this is my\nsister Monica. This is Chandler.\xc2\xa0 Phoebe.\xc2\xa0 Joey, what up?"
Joey	 What up?!'
Ross	 Everyone, this is Julie.'
Rachel	 (out of breath) Julie.'
All	 Ohh. (Happily) Hi!'
Julie	 Hi, but I'm not here, you haven't met me. I'll make a much better first\nimpression tomorrow when I don't have 20 hours of cab and plane on me."
Ross	 And bus.'
Julie	 Oh my god.'
Ross	\xc2\xa0 The screaming guy?'
Julie	\xc2\xa0 And the spitting?'
Ross	 You gotta hear this story.'
Julie	 We're on this bus, that's easily 200 years old..."
Ross	 200 at least.'
Julie	\xc2\xa0 ...and this guy...'
Rachel	 And the chicken pooped in her lap. Oh, I'm so sorry. I just gave away\nthe ending, didn't I? Oh! It's just, I just heard this story in the cab, and it is all I\ncan think about."
Monica	 This is amazing. I mean, how, how did this happen?'
Julie	 Well, Ross and I were in grad school together.'
Ross	 But we haven't seen each other since then. Well I land in China, guess\nwho's in charge of the dig. "
Rachel	 Julie! Julie, isn't that great? I mean, isn't that just\nkick-you-in-the-crotch, spit-on-your-neck fantastic?"
Monica	 (to Julie) It's an expression."
Ross	 Well, we just wanted to say a quick hi, and then we're gonna go see the\nbaby."
Julie	 And then we've gotta get some sleep."
Ross	 Yeah, it's really 6
Chandler	 Well, listen, don't tell us what's gonna happen though, 'cause I like\nto be surprised."
Rachel	 Bye. (She closes the door and everyone tries to sympathize with her.)'
Ross	 Hey, Rach, can I get some coffee?'
Rachel	 Yeah, sure.'
Ross	 Thank you.'
Chandler	 Hey, Rach, can I get...'
Rachel	 Did you talk to him?'
Chandler	 Not yet.'
Rachel	 Then, no.'
Chandler	 So what the hell happened to you in China? I mean, when last we left\nyou, you were totally in love with, you know.'
Ross	 I know, I know I was, but there was always this little voice inside that\nkept saying it's never gonna happen, move on. You know whose voice that was?"
Chandler	 God?'
Ross	 It was you, pal.'
Chandler	 Well, maybe it was God, doing me.'
Ross	 Look, you were right. She looks at me and sees a friend, that's all. But\nthen I met Julie, and I don't know, we're havin' a great time. And I have to say, I never\nwould've gone for it with her if it hadn't been for you."
Chandler	 Well, you owe me one, big guy.'
Rachel	 (To Ross) Here's your lemonade."
Ross	 I didn't order lemonade."
Rachel	 Oh. Well then, you better go take that back because they're gonna charge\nyou for that. "
Ross	 But...'
Rachel	 Go-go-go-go, come on! (Ross goes over to the counte) (to Chandler) So\nuh, what did you find out?'
Chandler	 He said...he said, he said that they're having a great time. I'm\nsorry. But, the silver lining, if you wanna see it, is that he made the decision all by\nhimself!\xc2\xa0 Without any outside help whatsoever."
Rachel	 How is that the silver lining?'
Chandler	 You have to really wanna see it.'
Ross	 Ironically, these are the guys who were picked last in gym.'
Monica	 Pheebes, you know what I'm thinking?"
Phoebe	 Oh, ok. How, it's been so long since you've had sex, you're wondering if\nthey've changed it?"
Monica	 No, although now that's what I'm thinking."
Phoebe	 All right, so what were you thinking?'
Monica	 Well, I was thinking, that you gave the guys such great haircuts, I\nthought, maybe you'd like to do mine?"
Phoebe	 Ohh! No.'
Monica	 Why not?'
Phoebe	 Because, I'm just, I'm incredibly anal and an unbelievable control\nfreak."
Monica	 No you're not."
Phoebe	 I know I'm not, but you are, and I was trying to spare your feelings."
Joey	 (answering the phone) Hello? Oh, hi. Yeah, hold on a second. Ross, it's\nJulie, for you. (Throws him the phone.)"
Ross	 (on phone) Hello? Hi.'
Chandler	 (entering) Hi. Anybody know a good tailor?'
Joey	 Needs some clothes altered?'
Chandler	 No, no, I'm just looking for a man to draw on me with chalk."
Joey	 Why don't you go see Frankie? My family's been goin' to him forever. He\ndid my first suit when I was 15. No wait, 16. No, 'scuse me, 15. (still confused) All\nright, when was 1990?"
Chandler	 Okay.\xc2\xa0 You have to stop the Q-tip when there's resistance!"
Ross	 (on phone) Ok, ok, sweetheart, I'll see you later. Ok, bye. What? (Sits\ndown next to Rachel) Oh, that is so sweet. No, no, ok, you hang up. Ok, ok, one, two,\nthree. (Doesn't hang up and motions for Rachel to be quiet) Well you didn't hang up\neither. "
Rachel	 She didn't hang up either!"
Ross	 Ok, no, no, you hang up. You, you, y...'
Rachel	 (taking the phone and hanging it up) Sorry, I thought you were talking\nto me.'
Ross	 Rachel! I'll just call her back. "
Rachel	 Okay!'
Ross	 (calls Julie back) Hi?\xc2\xa0 Sorry, we got disconnected... (Walks away.)'
Rachel	 (to Monica) Ok, ok, ok. How did this happen to me? How did this happen\nto me? A week ago, two weeks ago, I was fine. Ross was just Ross, just this guy. Now he's\nRrrooossss, oh, this really great guy that I can't have."
Monica	 Sweetie, I wanted you to have him too.'
Rachel	 I know you did. I'm just gonna deal with it, I'm just gonna deal with\nit. (Ross comes by, smoching with Julie on the phone.) I gotta get out of here. (Exits)"
Chandler	 Ok, I don't care what you guys say, something's bothering her."
Joey	 (to Chandler) You know, I think I was sixteen.'
Monica	 (to Phoebe) Please, just a little bit off the back.'
Phoebe	 I\'m still on "no."'
Rachel	 (poking her head in from her bedroom) Uh, morning. Do you guys think you\ncould close your eyes for just a sec?'
Joey	 No-no-no-no-no, (grabs his pants) I'm not fallin' for that again."
Phoebe	 What's goin' on?"
Rachel	 Well, I sorta did a stupid thing last night.'
Chandler	 What stupid thing did you do?'
Paulo	 (entering from Rachel's room) Bon giorno tutti!"
Phoebe	 Ewww! (Gets up and walks away.)'

Rachel	 Ok, Paulo, why don't you just go get dressed, and then you be on your\nway, ok, bye-bye. (Paulo goes into his room.)"
Monica	 Rachel, how did this happen?'
Rachel	 I don't know, I just kinda ran into him last night."
Phoebe	 Where?'
Rachel	 At his apartment. Is this juice?'
Joey	 Whoa, whoa. And the fact that you dumped him because he hit on Phoebe?'
Rachel	 Oh God, I know I'm a pathetic loser."
Monica	 Honey, you're not pathetic, you're sad."
Chandler	 People do stupid things when they're upset."
Monica	 My god, if I had a nickel for every guy I wish I hadn't...(Everyone\nlooks at her), but this is about your horrible mistake."
All	 Hi!'
Ross	 Hi. Sorry we're late but we were\xc2\x97well, there was touching."
Paulo	 (entering) Hey, hey Ross.'
Ross	 Hey, Paulo. What are you doing here?'
Paulo	 I do Raquel.'
Ross	 (to Rachel) So, uh, he's back."
Rachel	 Yeah, he's back. Is that a problem?"
Ross	 No, not a problem.'
Rachel	 Good! I'm glad it's not a problem."
Phoebe	 (to Paulo) Ok, you're gonna have to not touch my ass."
Chandler	 Well, in spite of the yummy bagels and palpable tension, I've got\npants that need to be altered."
Joey	 Hey, Chandler, when you see Frankie, tell him Joey Tribbiani says hello.\nHe'll know what it means."
Chandler	 Are you sure he's gonna be able to crack that code?"
Monica	 (to Phoebe) You know it's funny, the last time Paulo was here, my hair\nwas so much shorter and cuter."
Phoebe	 All right. Ok, but, but!\xc2\xa0 You have to promise that you will not be\nall like control-y and bossy and Monica about it.'
Monica	 I promise.'
Phoebe	 All right. (Talking to Monica's hair.) Now some of you are gonna get\ncut, and some of you aren't. But I promise none of you are gonna feel a thing."
Phoebe	 All right, that's it, I quit."
Monica	 What? I didn't say anything."
Phoebe	 Yeah, but this (makes Monica's face) isn't the face of a person who\ntrusts a person. Ok, this (makes Monica's face) is the face of a person who, you know,\ndoesn't trust a person."
Monica	 I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Phoebe. It's just a little shorter than what we\nhad discussed."
Phoebe	 Would you relax? I know what I am doing. This is how he wears it.'
Monica	 How who wears it?'
Phoebe	 Demi Moore.'
Monica	 Demi Moore is not a he.'
Phoebe	 Well, he was a he in Arthur, and in Ten.'
Monica	 That's Dudley Moore. I said I wanted it like Demi Moore."
Phoebe	 Oh.\xc2\xa0 Oh!'
Monica	 Oh my God!'
Phoebe	 Oh my God!'
Monica	 Oh my God!'
Phoebe	 Oh my God! I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Which one's Demi Moore?"
Monica	 She's the actress that was in Disclosure, Indecent\nProposal, Ghost!"
Phoebe	 Oh, she's got gorgeous hair."
Monica	 I know!'
Frankie	 How long do you want the cuffs?'
Chandler	 At least as long as I have the pants.'
Frankie	 I just got that. Ok, now we'll do your inseam."
Rachel	 How is she?'
Phoebe	 It's too soon to tell. She's resting, which is a good sign."
Ross	 How's the hair?"
Phoebe	 I'm not gonna lie to you, Ross, it doesn't look good. I put a clip on\none side, which seems to have stopped the curling."
Joey	 Can we see her?'
Phoebe	 Your hair looks too good, I think it would upset her. Ross, why don't\nyou come on in. "
Ross	\xc2\xa0 Yeah. (Gets up, but then pauses when he realizes what that\nmeant.)'
Joey	 How're you doing?"
Rachel	 I'm okay."
Joey	 Ooh, that bad, huh? '
Rachel	 What?'
Joey	 Look, I can sense when women are depressed and vulnerable. It's\none of my gifts."
Rachel	 When I saw him get off that plane with her, I really thought I hit rock\nbottom. But today, it's like there's rock bottom, 50 feet of crap, then me."
Joey	 You gotta tell Ross how you feel.'
Rachel	 Come on. How can I just tell him? What about Julie?'
Joey	 What about her? They've only been going out for two weeks. Ross has been\nin love with you for like 10 years."
Rachel	 I don't know, I don't know."
Joey	 Look, Rach, Rach! I've been with my share of women. In fact, I've been\nwith like a lot of people's share of women. The point is, I've never felt about anyone the\nway Ross felt about you."
Chandler	 (entering, angry) Yo, paisan! Can I talk to you for a sec? (Pause)\nYour tailor is a very bad man!'
Joey	 Frankie? What're you talking about?"
Ross	 (entering from the bedroom) Hey, what's goin' on? (Pats Chandler on the\nshoulder which causes him to jump.)"
Chandler	 Joey's tailor...took advantage of me."
Ross	 What?'
Joey	 No way. I've been going to the guy for 12 years."
Chandler	 Oh come on! He said he was going to do my inseam, and he ran his hand\nup my leg, and then, there was definite...'
Ross	 What?'
Chandler	 Cupping.'
Joey	 That's how they do pants! First they go up one side, they move it over,\nthen they go up the other side, they move it back, and then they do the rear. (Chandler\nand Ross stare at him) What? Ross, Ross, would you tell him? Isn't that how they measure\npants?"
Ross	 Yes, yes it is. In prison! Whatsa matter with you?'
Joey	 What? That's not? (Realizes) Oh my God."
Monica	 Even Mary Tyler Moore would've been better."
Ross	 I like it. I do, I think it's a Ten. (Chandler laughs.)"
Monica	 Thank you. My hair is very amused.'
Chandler	 Come on, Monica, things could be worse. You could get caught between\nthe moon and New York City. I know it's crazy, but it's true."
Phoebe	 (to Chandler and Ross) Thank you.'
Ross	 Well, I gotta go. Bye. Bye, Rach.'
Rachel	 (sticking her head in from the balcony) Wait, are you leaving?'
Ross	 Yeah, that\'s kinda what I meant by "bye!"'
Rachel	 Well, can I talk to you for a sec? '
Ross	 Okay. (goes out onto the balcony)'
Joey	 Hey, when the doctor does that hernia test...'
Chandler	 That's ok."
Ross	 What's goin' on?"
Rachel	 Well, first of all, Paulo and I are not back together. It was just a\nstupid thing I did, and if I could go back in time and do it again, well, I wouldn't. Um,\nsecond of all (Ross is laughing), what?"
Ross	 Ok. Well, before I say anything, I just need to know, is this one of those\nthings where you break up with a guy, and then I tell you what I think, and then the next\nday you get back together with the guy, and I look like a complete idiot?'
Rachel	 No. No-no-no-no.'
Ross	 Well, then, I think, I think the guy is scum. I hate him. I mean I\nactually\xc2\x97I-I physically hate him. I always have. You are way too good to be with a\nguy like that. '
Rachel	 Really?'
Ross	 You deserve to be with someone who appreciates you, and who gets\nhow funny and sweet and amazing, and adorable, and sexy you are, you know? Someone who\nwakes up every morning thinking "Oh my god, I\'m with Rachel". You know, someone\nwho makes you feel good, the way I am with Julie. (Rachel has moved closer, but hearing\nthat she starts to back up.) Was there a second of all?'
Rachel	 No, I think that was the whole all.'
Ross	 Okay.\xc2\xa0 Okay. (They hug.) Okay.'
Joey	 I swear to god, Dad. That's not how they measure pants."

Julie	 I was thinking of doing it a little shorter, you know, like Andie\nMcDowell's new haircut?"
Phoebe	 Oh yeah!\xc2\xa0 Oh, I can do that.'
Julie	 Really?'
Phoebe	 You wanna do it right now?'
Julie	 Great! (Julie leaves)'
Phoebe	 (to Rachel) Ok, I just wanna be really sure this time. Andie McDowell's\nthe girl from Four Weddings and a Funeral, right?"
Rachel	 No. No no no no no. That's Rodney McDowell. Andie McDowell is the guy\nfrom Planet of the Apes."
Phoebe	 Oh, yeah. Ok, thank you.'
Rachel	 You're welcome."
