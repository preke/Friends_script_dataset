Emily	 Really?'
Ross	 Yeah?'
Emily	 I don\xc2\x92t think I\xc2\x92d be comfortable with any of my old lovers\nthere.'
Ross	 Wait-wait-wait, do you, do you think, maybe we shouldn\xc2\x92t invite her?'
Emily	 Oh, no-no, y\xc2\x92know I absolutely adore Rachel it\xc2\x92s just that,\nwell it might be a awkward for you. But it\xc2\x92s absolutely your decision. (Gets up.)\nMore tea?'

Monica	 Rachel?!'
Rachel	 Oh God Monica hi! I just went to your building and you weren't there and\nthen this guy with a big hammer said you might be here and you are, you are!"
Monica	 Okay, everybody, this is Rachel, another Lincoln High survivor. (To\nRachel) This is everybody, this is Chandler, and Phoebe, and Joey, and- you remember my\nbrother Ross? '
Rachel	 Hi, sure!'
Ross	 Hi. '
Ross	 You know you probably didn't know this, but back in high school, I had a,\num, major crush on you."
Rachel	 I knew.'
Ross	 You did! Oh.... I always figured you just thought I was Monica's geeky\nolder brother."
Rachel	 I did.'
Ross	 Oh. Listen, do you think- and try not to let my intense vulnerability\nbecome any kind of a factor here\xc2\x97but do you think it would be okay if I asked you\nout? Sometime? Maybe?'
Rachel	 Yeah, maybe...'
Ross	 Okay... okay, maybe I will...'
Ross	\xc2\xa0 See, I see.... big passion in your future.'

Ross	 I do.'
Rachel	 Oh Ross, you're so great. [she playfully rubs his head and gets up]"
Joey	 It's never gonna happen."
Ross	 Hey, I have a question. Well, actually, it's not so much a question as..\nmore of a general wondering... ment."
Rachel	 Okay.'
Ross	 Okay. Umm, for a while now, I've been wanting to, um...."
Rachel	 Ohhh!!!! [looking at something behind Ross]'
Ross	 Yes, yes, that's right..."
Rachel	 Oh, look at the little cat! [a small kitten is on the roof behind Ross]\nLook at it!'

Rachel	 (to Ross) Yes! Did you see that?'
Ross	 You were incredible! Brand new woman, ladies and gentlemen.'
Rachel	 I could not have done this without you.'
Ross	 Ok, um, uh, more clothes in the dryer? (Ross turns and bangs his head on\nan open dryer door.) I'm fine, I'm fine."
Ross	 You had no right to tell me you ever had feelings for me.'
Rachel	 (hurt) What?'
Ross	 I was doing great with Julie before I found out about you.'
Rachel	 Hey, I was doin' great before I found out about you. You think it's easy\nfor me to see you with Julie?"
Ross	 The point is I... I don't need this right now, OK. It, it's too late, I'm\nwith somebody else, I'm happy. This ship has sailed."
Rachel	 Alright, fine, you go ahead and you do that, alright Ross.'
Ross	 Fine.'
Rachel	 'Cause I don't need your stupid ship."
Ross	 Good.'
Rachel	 Good. (Ross leaves)'
Rachel	 Ross do you realise this is the first time in my life I\xc2\x92m doing\nsomething I actually care about. This is the first time in my life I\xc2\x92m doing\nsomething that I\xc2\x92m actually good at. I mean. if you don\xc2\x92t get that...'

Ross	 WE WERE ON A BREAK!!!!!!!'
Rachel	 You seem to really like her.'
Ross	 Yeah, I really do. Yeah, but what am I gonna do, I mean we-we both agreed\nthat it was gonna be a two-week thing, y\xc2\x92know no commitment.'
Rachel	 Ross, that girl just spent the entire evening talking to your friends,\nasking to hear stories about you, looking through Monica\xc2\x92s photo albums, I mean you\ndon\xc2\x92t do that if you\xc2\x92re just in it for two weeks.'
Ross	 You think?'
Rachel	 Yeah, you got like 14 hours until she has to be at the airport, and\nyou\xc2\x92re sitting here in the hallway with a 28-year-old cheerleader with a fat lip.'
Ross	 Hey, you\xc2\x92re right.'
Rachel	 Yeah.'

Monica	 Ohh, this is soo amazing! I can\xc2\x92t believe my brother\xc2\x92s getting\nmarried! And in London! It\xc2\x92s so romantic!'

Chandler	 I didn\xc2\x92t know that.'

Rachel	 (entering) Hey guys! What\xc2\x92s up?'
Joey	 Heyyy. (They all try and hide their invitations.)'
Monica	 We\xc2\x92re hanging out.'
Rachel	 What\xc2\x92s this? Is this Ross\xc2\x92s wedding invitation?'

Monica	 You know what would be real weird? Is if you weren\xc2\x92t there. Just\nsay you\xc2\x92ll think about it, okay?'
Rachel	 No, I\xc2\x92ll think about it. Yeah.'
Rachel	 Who's this from?"
Chandler	 Oh, that's Ross's. "
Rachel	 Oh... (opens it and sees it is a pin) Oh my God. He remembered.'
Phoebe	 Remembered what?'
Rachel	 It was like months ago. We were walking by this antique store, and I saw\nthis pin in the window, and I told him that it was just like one my grandmother had when I\nwas a little girl. Oh! I can't believe he remembered!"
Phoebe	 Oh, it's so pretty. This must have cost him a fortune."
Monica	 I can't believe he did this."
Chandler	 Come on, Ross? Remember back in college, when he fell in love with\nCarol and bought her that ridiculously expensive crystal duck?'
Rachel	 What did you just say?'
Chandler	 (stuttering incoherently) F-hah.... flennin....'
Rachel	 Oh.... my God.'
Rachel	\xc2\xa0 (seeing Ross come off the plane with another woman.) Oh my God.'
Julie	 Well, Ross and I were in grad school together.'
Ross	 But we haven't seen each other since then. Well I land in China, guess\nwho's in charge of the dig. "
Rachel	 Julie! Julie, isn't that great? I mean, isn't that just kick-\nyou-in-the-crotch, spit-on-your-neck fantastic?"
Ross	 Oh, that is so sweet.(listens) No, no, ok, you hang up. Ok, ok, one, two,\nthree.(He doesn't hang up and motions for Rachel to be quiet.) Well you didn't hang up\neither. "
Rachel	\xc2\xa0 She didn't hang up either..."
Ross	\xc2\xa0 Ok, no, no, you hang up. You, you, y\xc2\x97(Rachel grabs the phone\nand hangs it up for him.)'
Rachel	 (on phone) Ross, hi, it's Rachel. I'm just calling to say that um,\neverything's fine and I'm really happy for you and your cat...(cut)...I\nam over you. I am over you and that, my friend, is what they call closure. (She hangs up\nand tosses phone in the ice bucket.)"
Ross	 Rach, I got a message from you.'
Rachel	 Oh my God. Oh my God Ross, no, hang up the phone, give me the phone\nRoss, give me the phone, give me the phone, give me the. . . (She jumps the couch and\nlands on Ross's back, finally getting the phone from him. Ross has a confused expression\non his face.)"
Ross	 You're over me?"
Rachel	 Ohhhhhhhh God. (climbs off his back)'
Ross	 Wha... you're uh, you're, you're over me?"
Rachel	 Ohh, ohh.'
Ross	 When, when were you... under me?'
Rachel	 Well, basically, lately, I've uh, I've uh, sort of had feelings for you."
Ross	 OK, I need to lie down. '
Joey	 He broke up with Julie. Well, go hug her, for god's sakes."
Rachel	 Really?'
Ross	 Really. It's always been you, Rach."
Rachel	 Oh, god.'
Chandler and Joey	 Ohhh.'
Ross	 I've no idea, could be. Listen, I'm sorry I had to work tonight."
Rachel	 Oh it's OK. You were worth the wait, and I don't just mean tonight."
Rachel	 Ah, oh God. Oh, honey, oh that's OK."
Ross	 What. Oh no, you just rolled over the juice box.'
Ross	 Gunther! Gunther. Gunther, please tell me you didn\xc2\x92t say anything to\nRachel about me and the girl from the Xerox place.'
Gunther	 I\xc2\x92m sorry. Was I not supposed to?'
Ross	 Y'know, hey! You\xc2\x92re the one who ended it, remember?"
Rachel	 Yeah, because I was mad at you, not because I stopped loving you!'
Ross	 You still love me?'
Rachel	 Noo.'
Ross	 What does this mean? What do you, I mean do you wanna, get back together?'
Rachel	 Noo! Maybe! I, I don\xc2\x92t know. '
Ross	 What?!'
Rachel	 I just, I feel, I-I just...'
Rachel	 Y'know I can\xc2\x92t believe I even thought about getting back\ntogether again! We are so over!!"
Ross	 (starts to cry) FINE BY ME!! (he opens the door and traps Chandler behind\nit)'
Rachel	 And hey! Just so you know, it\xc2\x92s not that common! It doesn\xc2\x92t\nhappen to every guy! And it is a big deal!!'
Chandler	 I KNEW IT!!!!'
Mrs. Geller	 Rachel's coming up the path.\xc2\xa0 Doesn't she look\npretty. Jack... (Rachel enters with a huge nose)"

Monica	 You know what this is, this is us getting ready for the prom.'
Rachel	 Oh.'
Ross	 You know what, you guys, we don't have to watch this."
All	 Oh yeah we do. C'mon."
Mrs. Geller	 Get a shot of Monica. Where's Monica."
Mr. Geller	 Wait, how do you zoom out? (zooms out and we see an\nextremely overweight Monica eating a big sandwich) There she is.'
Monica	 Shut up, the camera adds ten pounds.'
Chandler	 Ahh, so how many cameras are actually on you?'
Monica	 Oh, dad, turn it off.'
Mr. Geller	 It is off.\xc2\xa0 Right Ross? (pans over to see Ross with\nan afro and moustache)'
Joey	 Lookin' good Mr. Cotter."
Rachel	 I can't go to my own prom without a date, I can't, it's too\nlate."
Monica	 If you're not going then I don't want to go either."
Mrs. Geller	 (to Ross on the stairs) I have a wonderful idea. You\nshould take Rachel to the prom.'
Ross	 Y'know what?\xc2\xa0 I think we've seen enough, let's turn it off."
All	 No, no, no.'
Ross	 OK, fine, well I'm not gonna watch, alright."
Mr. Geller	 C'mon kid, let's go."
Mrs. Geller	 Ahh, are you hadsome.'
Mr. Geller	 Let's show 'em."
Ross	 (walks down the stairs and grabs the flowers out of the vase on\nthe endtable) Okay dad.'
Mr. Geller	 (going downstairs) Rachel, ready or not, here comes your\nknight in shining\xc2\x97Oh no. (Chip has shown up and the four are leaving.)'
Rachel, Monica, Roy, and Chip	 Bye.'
Mrs. Geller	 Oh, dear. Jack, how do I turn this off?'
Monica	 (to Ross) I can't believe you did that."
Ross	 Yeah, well.'
Phoebe	 See, he's her lobster."
Monica	 (seeing the decision) Nooooo. You\xc2\x92re really not going?'
Rachel	 Yeah. It\xc2\x92s just gonna be too hard. Y\xc2\x92know? I mean, it\xc2\x92s\nRoss. How can I watch him get married? Y\xc2\x92know it\xc2\x92s just, it\xc2\x92s for the best,\ny\xc2\x92know it is, it\xc2\x92s\xc2\x85 Y\xc2\x92know, plus, somebody\xc2\x92s got to stay here\nwith Phoebe! Y\xc2\x92know she\xc2\x92s gonna be pretty big by then, and she needs someone to\nhelp her tie her shoes; drive her to the hospital in case she goes into labour.'
Monica	 You don\xc2\x92t have a car. And your license expired. '
Rachel	 I know. (Starts to cry) Yeah, see, there\xc2\x92s so much to do and I have\nso little time to do it in.'

Chandler	 All right, check it out. Check this out. It says here that\nthere\xc2\x92s a place you can go to rent videos of all the museums! (Reading from the\nbook.) "It\xc2\x92s almost as good as being there."'
Joey	 It\xc2\x92s better! You can\xc2\x92t go to a museum in your underwear!'
Chandler	 Well, You could, but... probably just the one\ntime.'
Joey	 I bet we could get videos of all the sites, get a VCR in our\nhotel room... we'd never even have to go outside!"
Chandler	 If we do that, we gotta get Die Hard.'
Joey	 Oh-ho! I bet the British version is gooooood!'
