Rachel	 Pheebs? Could you get that? Please?'
Phoebe	 Why? Just 'cause you're too lazy to get up off your touchie? "
Rachel	 No! No! It's just that all the people in the entire world that I\nwant to talk to are right here."
Phoebe	 (smiles) Okay! (Goes to answer the phone.)'
Rachel	 (under her breath) Sucker!'
Phoebe	 (answering the phone) Hello? (Listens) Hey Joey!'
Joey	 Hey Pheebs! Listen, uh can you do me a favor? I forgot the pin number to\nmy ATM card can, can you get it for me?'
Phoebe	 Sure! Where is it?'
Joey	 Uh, I scratched it on the ATM machine down on the corner.'
Phoebe	 Ohh! So you're 5639?!"
Joey	 That's it! Thanks Pheebs!"
Chandler	 (entering) Hey!'
Phoebe	 (to Joey) Ooh, do you want to talk to Chandler?'
Chandler	 (To Phoebe) Is that Joey?! (She nods yes) Let me talk to him!'
Joey	 No! (She nods no to Chandler) Because he didn't believe in my movie! Which\nis a big mistake because it is real! Real!"
A Casino Boss	 Hey! Tribbiani! Get back to work! Break time's over!"
Phoebe	 Who was that?'
Joey	 Uhh, my stunt double. Yeah, and y'know, he's getting a little too familiar\nfor my tastes."
Chandler	 (To Phoebe) Y'know what? I have been trying to apologize to him all\nweek! If he's not gonna let me do it on the phone, I'm gonna go down there and do it in\nperson."
Joey	 Uhh Pheebs, I heard that. Can you put him on?'
Phoebe	 Yeah! (She hands the phone to Chandler.)'
Chandler	 (To Joey) Hey!'
Joey	 Don't come out here!"
Chandler	 No-no-no-no, I've supported you one hundred percent and I want to\nprove that to you in person!"
Joey	 I got that! I forgive ya! Don't come out here!"
Chandler	 Forgive me? You haven't been taking my calls in a week!"
Joey	 Well, I'm totally over it Chandler. Friends forever! Don't come out here!"
A Tourist	 (To Joey) Would you mind doing a picture with us?'
Chandler	 Uh, what was that?'
Joey	 Uh, Entertainment Tonight. [Cut to Chandler] Yeah, okay so, good\ntalking to ya and don't come out here. All right. (Hangs up the phone and poses for that\npicture.)"

Phoebe	 Monica! I'm sorry I'm late! (Starts looking around for her) Monica?\n(Goes into Monica's bedroom.)"
Monica	 (entering) Phoebe? (Phoebe comes back into the living room) Oh, Phoebe,\nI'm so sorry. Have you been here long?"
Phoebe	 (saddened) It's okay. What the hell took you so long?"
Monica	 Okay, you can not tell Chandler. Okay? That I ran into Richard.'
Phoebe	 Which Richard?'
Monica	 The Richard.'
Phoebe	 Richard Simmons?! Oh my God!'
Monica	 Noo! My ex-boyfriend Richard! Y'know the tall guy, moustache? "
Phoebe	 Oh! Okay, that actually makes more sense. So how was it?'
Monica	 It was, it was really nice. We started talking and I-I ended up having\nlunch with him.'
Phoebe	 That is so weird! I had a dream that you'd have lunch with Richard."
Monica	 Really?'
Phoebe	 But again, Simmons. Go on.'
Monica	 The strange part was, he was really nice, umm and he looks great, but I\ndidn't feel anything at all!"
Phoebe	 Ooh! So now why can't we tell Chandler?"
Monica	 Because it would totally freak him out and tomorrow's our anniversary. I\njust don't want anything to spoil that."
Phoebe	 Oh, I can't believe you guys lasted a whole year!"
Monica	 I know.'
Phoebe	 Wow! I owe Rachel 20 bucks!'
Monica	 What?'
Phoebe	 On a totally different bet.'
Chandler	 (entering) Hey!'
Monica	 It's almost our anniversary!"
Chandler	 I know. Can you believe it? One year ago today I was just your\nannoying friend Chandler.'
Phoebe	 Awww! Now you're just my annoying friend Chandler."
Chandler	 Huh.'
Monica	 I got you a present!'
Chandler	 Oh, but it's not 'til tomorrow!"
Monica	 I know, but you have to open it today! (Hands it too him.)'
Chandler	 Okay.'
Monica	 (grabbing the gift from him and opening it) Okay! There you go! It's two\ntickets to Vegas!"
Chandler	 Wow!'
Monica	 For this weekend! Oh gosh, it would be perfect, we get to see Joey plus\nwe get to start our anniversary celebration on the plane. We can call it out\nplane-aversary.'
Chandler	 Do we have to?'
Monica	 No.'
Chandler	 Okay this is great, but Joey said he didn't want any of us out there."
Monica	 Oh, he just doesn't want us to go through any trouble. Think of how\nexcited he'll be when we go out and surprise him! Plus we get to have our own,\nani-Vegas-ary! A-Nevadaversary!"
Chandler	 Yeah, I think we should see other people.'
Monica	 But we can go, right?'
Chandler	 Yes.'
Monica	 Okay!'
Chandler	 It's a great idea. (They kiss)"
Phoebe	 Okay, I'm gonna go too!"
Chandler	 Y'know Pheebs, it's kinda our (His and Monica's) anniversary."
Phoebe	 Oh please, you are not gonna ditch again like you did with London.'
Monica	 Ditch you? Phoebe, you were pregnant with the triplets!'
Phoebe	 Uh-huh, great story! I'm going!"
Rachel	 (entering with Ross) Hi!'
Phoebe	 Hey!'
Ross	 Hey!'
Phoebe	 Hey, you guys, listen, this weekend we're all gonna go to Las Vegas to\nsurprise Joey! Including me!! You wanna go?!"
Rachel	 Well, I guess I could take a couple days off work.'
Phoebe	 Of course you can take a couple days off work because this trip includes\nme!'
Rachel	 Oh no, wait a minute, wait, I've got a presentation tomorrow. I can't\nmiss that."
Ross	 Oh, but I've got tickets to the Van Gogh exhibit! I've been waiting like a\nyear for this."
Chandler	 (coughing) Art lover!'
Ross	 What'd you say?"
Chandler	 I said art lover.'
Ross	 Is that supposed to be an insult?'
Chandler	 I don't know, I'm very tired. "
Ross	 So Rach, maybe you and I could fly out together Saturday.'
Rachel	 That sounds great.'
Ross	 Yeah? All right I'll call the airlines. (Picks up the phone and does so)"
Rachel	 Okay. Yeah, that would be nice actually, to have the apartment to myself\nfor a night.'
Phoebe	 Oh yeah, so you can walk around naked.'
Rachel	 No! So I can be by myself. Y'know? Have a little alone time."
Phoebe	 Naked alone time.'
Rachel	 No! Phoebe just because I'm alone doesn\xc2\x92t mean I wanna walk around\nnaked. I mean, you live alone, you don't walk around naked."
Phoebe	 Uh-huh! Why do you think it takes me so long to answer the door?'
Phoebe	 So, so far is this trip to Vegas better or worse than the trip to\nLondon?'
Chandler	 So it's pretty much the same Pheebs."
Phoebe	 Okay, what about after I give you these candies? (Hands them each one\nfrom her purse.)'
Chandler	 Yeah, I guess it's a little better now."
Phoebe	 Ah-ha! Okay, (takes out a notepad) Las Vegas 1, London 0! I'll be right\nback. (Gets up and heads aft.)"
Chandler	 (To Monica) Happy plane-aversary.'
Monica	 Aww! I love you!'
Chandler	 Can I give you a present now?'
Monica	 Okay!'
Chandler	 Okay! (He grabs his carryon and starts rummaging through it.) Oh man!\nDon\xc2\x92t tell me I did this!'
Monica	 I love the "I forgot the present" fake out!'
Chandler	 How do you feel about the, "I really did forgot the present,\nplease forgive me" not fake out?'
Monica	 Oh that's okay. Don\xc2\x92t worry about it, you can give it to me when we\nget back."
Chandler	 Ohh that's the worse thing that can happen on an anniversary\never!"
Phoebe	 (sitting down) Oh good! All right, so you decided to tell him about the\nRichard thing.'
Chandler	 What-what Richard thing?'
Phoebe	 Oh no. [The patented version.]'
Chandler	 What Richard thing?'
Phoebe	 (To Monica under her breath) Simmons! Go with Simmons!'
Monica	 Okay, I umm, I ran into Richard yesterday and he asked me if I wanted to\ngo for a bite and I did. The only reason I didn't tell you is because I knew you'd get mad\nand I didn't want to spoil our anniversary."
Chandler	 (talking out of the side of his mouth) I'm not mad."
Monica	 Really?!'
Chandler	 Oh yeah! Yeah, so you-you bumped into Richard! You grabbed a bite!\nIt's no big deal. (He still ain't happy.)"
Monica	 Great!'
Phoebe	 Okay, London 1\xc2\x85'
Rachel	 (takes off her robe) Oh! Look what happened! {Don't get your hopes up\nguys, we only get to see her from the back or from the neck up. Its times like these I\nwish that the networks would broadcast some nudity other than Denis Franz's butt.} (In her\nhead.) Huh, check me out! I'm in my kitchen\xc2\x85naked! I'm picking up an orange. (Does\nso) I'm naked! (Goes into the living room) Lighting the candles, naked, and\ncarefully. (She backs anything that might have a point like a candle on her body\naway.)"
Ross	 (in his head) Oh my God! That's Rachel naked! I can't look at that! I\nam looking at this. (Looks back at his book.) Okay, vivid colors, expressive brush\nstrokes\xc2\x97Unless she wants me to be looking at that. She knows I'm home. She\nknows I can see her. What kind of game is she playing? I think maybe someone's lonely\ntonight. Oh-ho, Dr. Geller! Stop it! You're being silly! Or, am I?"
Rachel	 (singing) Love to love ya baby! Ow! Love to love ya baby! Ow!\n(There's a knock on the door, she turns off the music, puts on her robe, and goes to\nanswer the door.) Love to love ya, baby! (There's another knock.) Darnit! (Looks\nthrough the peephole and turns on the lights.) Ugh. (She opens the door to Ross who's\nleaning against the door jam.) "
Ross	 Hey.'

Ross	 May I come in?'
Rachel	 Uh, yeah, if you want too.'
Ross	 Do you want me too?'
Rachel	 Yeah, sure?'
Ross	 So do I. (Slowly walks in.) Okay Rach, before anything happens (He takes\noff his coat) I just want to lay down a couple of ground rules. (Turns back to face her.)\nThis is just about tonight. I don\'t to go through with this if it\'s going to raise the\nquestion of "Us." (Rachel\'s confused) Okay? I just want this to be (Kicks off\nhis left shoe) about what it is! (Kicks off the other one.)'
Rachel	 And um, what-what is that Ross?'
Ross	 The physical act of love. (Hisses at her.)'
Rachel	 (laughs) What?! Are you crazy?'
Ross	 Oh so-so you weren't trying to entice me just now with your-your\nnakedness?"
Rachel	 (gasps) Oh God, you saw me?! Oh!'
Ross	 You weren't trying to entice me with your nakedness."
Rachel	 Noo!! No! You thought, you actually thought I wanted to have sex with\nyou?!'
Ross	 No! No! (Grabs his coat) No! (Grabs a shoe.) No-no-no-no. (Grabs the other\none and heads for the door.)'
Rachel	 Ohh wow! I\xc2\x92m sorry, but Ross you kicked off your shoes!'
Ross	 Can we, can we just forget this ever happened?'
Rachel	 Yes of course, absolutely! You're right. I'm sorry."
Ross	 Thank you.'
Rachel	 Yes.'
Ross	 All right I guess I'm, gonna go pack. (Starts to leave)"
Rachel	 Okay. Oh wait! One more thing umm, do-do we still need to uh settle the\nquestion of "us?"'
Phoebe	 Hey you guys wait! Guys! (Catches up to them.) This place is so much\nbetter than London! Okay? This lady dressed like Cleopatra gave me a coupon, 99 cent steak\nand lobster dinner. Huh!'
Monica	 Phoebe, you don't eat animals. "
Phoebe	 For 99 cents, I'd eat you. (Sees the casino) Okay, I can totally settle\ndown here. It's got everything I could ever want, including Joey! Look! (Points to Joey in\nhis gladiator suit posing for a picture with two old ladies.) Oh! Look! Hi!"
Chandler	 Oh my God.'
Phoebe	 Hey! Joey! (They all head over to him, he spots them coming and panics.)\nHey! Hey!! Wow! (She hugs him.)'
Joey	 Hi!'
Chandler	 Love your condoms my man.'
Joey	 What-what are you guys doing here? I thought I told you not to come.'
Phoebe	 Why are you dressed as a gladiator?'
Joey	 Uhh, because I'm shooting a scene right now. Yeah, I uh, I play a\ngladiator. Uh, y'know what? Hold-hold on a second. (To no one in particular) Can we cut?\nYeah, my-my friends are here, I'm gonna take a little break."
Monica	 Who are you talking too?'
Joey	 They uh director. Uhh, her. (Points to an old woman standing behind him.\nWho glares at him and walks off.) All right, all right, it's not a gladiator movie. I work\nhere."
Chandler	 Why?! What happened?!'
Joey	 Well, the movie got shutdown because they ran out of money, so I'm working\nhere 'til it starts up again, if it ever does."
Monica	 I'm so sorry."
Joey	 Look, I'm sorry I didn't tell ya. (To Chandler) I'm sorry man."
Chandler	 No-no, that's okay, apparently there's a new policy where we don't\nhave to share everything with everybody."
Monica	 I knew you were not okay with that.'
Phoebe	 So you're a gladiator! Wow!"
Joey	 Yeah, what-what's going on?"
Phoebe	 Monica had lunch with Richard.'
Joey	 Dawson?! '
Phoebe	 Noo! But that would've been so cool!"
Chandler	 No! Her boyfriend Richard!'
Monica	 It meant nothing! Okay? After all this time, how can you not\ntrust me?'
Chandler	 When you go lunching with hunky moustache men and don't tell me about\nit!"
Monica	 You're right. I'm sorry. I should've told you."
Chandler	 Thanks. (They hug.)'
Joey	 Aww, there we go.'
Phoebe	 I love Vegas!'
Monica	 I promise you, next time I will absolutely tell you.'
Chandler	 (pushing her away from another hug) Next time?'
Joey	 Ooh, so close.'
Chandler	 There's not gonna be a next time! You can not ever see him again!"
Monica	 I can not see him? I mean, you can't tell me what to do!"
Chandler	 That's so funny, because I think I just did!"
Monica	 Oh y'know what? If you're gonna be acting like this all night, I really,\nI don't even want to be around you."
Chandler	 Fine with me!'
Monica	 Fine! Happy Anniversary!'
Joey	 Whoa! Whoa! Guys! Please! Come on! Come on! This is obviously just a big\nmisunderstanding.'
Monica	 No it is not!'
Chandler	 What are you talking\xc2\x85'
Joey	 Hey-hey don't look at me! I just work here! (Walks away.)"
Rachel	 (taking off her sweater) Okay umm, Ross? I'm-I'm really warm, so I'm\ngoing to be taking off my sweater. Now, I'm just letting you know that this is not\nan invitation to the physical act of love."
Ross	 (sarcastic) Yep! That's hilarious!"
Rachel	 I'm sorry. I'm done. I'm done."
Ross	 Y'know, last night was embarrassing for you too."
Rachel	 No, not really. I mean you've seen me naked hundreds of times."
Ross	 Uh-huh. But it was a first for the rest of my building.'
Rachel	 Okay. All right, that's true! But y'know I just don't embarrass that\neasily."
Ross	 What?! You totally get embarrassed!'
Rachel	 No, I don't! Ross, I think I'm just a more secure person than you are."
Ross	 Is that so?'
Rachel	 Yeah.'
Ross	 (loudly so that everyone can hear) Hey lady! I don't care how much you\nwant it! Okay?! I am not gonna to have sex with you in the bathroom! (Rachel\nsinks lower on her chair trying to hide.)"
Joey	 Hey, y'know in Roman times this was more than just a hat."
Chandler	 Really?'
Joey	 Yeah, sure! Sure! They would uh, they would scrub the floors with it! They\nwould use it to get the mud off their shoe. And sometimes underneath the horse would get\ndirty so they would stick it right\xc2\x85'
Chandler	 (interrupting in the nick of time) Joey, I uh! I can't believe\nthis is how I'm spending my anniversary."
Joey	 All right well, I'll take you someplace nice then. Look! A guy tipped me a\nhundred bucks today."
Chandler	 Whoa!'
Joey	 Yeah-yeah, he was playing blackjack for like an hour and he won $5,000.\nCan you believe that? $5,000!'
Chandler	 Y'know, if I won $5,000 I'd join a gym, y'know build up my upper body\nand hit Richard from behind with a stick! (Mimics it.)"
Joey	 Wait a minute! Why don't I do what that guy did? I'll take this $100 and\nturn it into $5,000! And then I'll turn that into enough money to get my movie\ngoing again!"
Chandler	 Good luck! '
Joey	 Chandler! I don't need luck. I have thought this through!"
Chandler	 I see.'

Monica	 (to the bartender) Thank you.'
Phoebe	 Thanks.'
Monica	 I can't believe this! This is like the worst night ever!"
Phoebe	 Y'know Monica you had a minor setback in your relationship with\nChandler. Big deal! It's only Chandler. (Monica turns and stares at her.) I am so\nsorry."
Monica	 This is crazy! I mean, it's such a stupid argument. I don't even wanna\nsee Richard again."
Phoebe	 So go fix it! Go find Chandler! He's probably up in your room! Tell him\nthat you're sorry and that you love him."
Monica	 Y'know what? You're right Phoebe. You're right. Thank you! (Gets up to\nfind Chandler.)"
Phoebe	 Sure! (When Monica gets close to the door.) (Yelling) Yeah! Las Vegas,\nnumber one!'
Monica	 Anybody lose this? (Holds up the chip and the woman next to her shakes\nher head no.)'
The Croupier	 Comin' out. Place your bet. (Monica does so.) Dice are out. (The\nwoman next to Monica rolls the dice.) Double or nothin'! Pay the front line! (Monica won\nand doubled the chip.)"
Monica	 Hmm.'
Guy	 (To Rachel) So uh, I'm on my way back to the bathroom. (Ross\ngiggles.)"
Rachel	 Yeah, all right. All right! Just keep walkin'! All right?"
Rachel	 Ross! What are you\xc2\x85 I'm sorry sir. I just, I think he just really\nlikes you."
Ross	 (to the guy in the window seat next to him) Hey! Y'know that teacher who\nhad a baby with her student? (He points at Rachel.)"
Ross	 What the? What\xc2\x85'
Rachel	 (to the flight attendant who appears in record time. It was only seconds\nafter Rachel pushed the call button was she there. Once again, more proof that TV isn't\nreal, IRL she would've been waiting for the rest of the flight and by then Ross's pants\nwould be dry.) Hi! "
The Flight Attendant	 Miss? May I help you?'
Rachel	 Yes, I'm sorry. Do you have any extra pants? Umm, my friend seems to\nhave had a little accident."
Joey	 (to the dealer) Can I change a hundred? (He hands him his chip.)'
Blackjack Dealer	 Changing one hundred! (Gives him the change.) Good luck sir.'
Joey	 (betting all 100) Let's ride."
Blackjack Dealer	 (Deals the cards) 13.'
Joey	 Hit me! (He does so.) Ohh man! (Joey busts and loses all the money, but\nwhen the dealer starts to collect the cards Joey notices something.) Wait! (He holds his\nhand next to the dealer's hand.)"
Joey	 Chandler! You are not gonna believe this! I have found my identical\nhand twin!'
Chandler	 (totally confused) What?'
Joey	 My identical hand twin!'
Chandler	 What's an identical hand twin?"
Joey	 What's it sound like? It's a guy with my identical hands! It was\nincredible! Chandler, the dealer's hands were exactly like me! It-it was like looking at\nmy hands in a mirror!"
Chandler	 Are you sure you weren't (pause) looking at your hands in a mirror?"
Joey	 Don\xc2\x92t you see what this means?! I can forget about that stupid movie.\nI'm gonna be a millionaire!"
Chandler	 (totally confused) How?'
Joey	 Look, I don't have it all worked out yet, but it's gotta mean big money!\nCome on! Identical hands!"
Chandler	 Again I must go back to, how?'
Joey	 This is Vegas man! People will pay to see freaky stuff! Okay, how much\nwould you pay to see this hand (Holds up his left hand) twice? Huh?'
Chandler	 (Pause) Y'know, I-I can't really put a price on that Joe."
Joey	 Hey, are you unsupporting me again?'
Chandler	 No! No! I support you 100%! I just didn't, I didn't get it right away.\nY'know now I'm caught up! Identical hand twins! It's a million-dollar idea!"
Phoebe	 Hey!'
Joey	 Pheebs!!'
Phoebe	 Yeah?'
Joey	 I found my identical hand twin!'
Phoebe	 Ohh, you are so lucky! (To Chandler) Hey! So, where's Monica? Did\nyou guys make up?"
Chandler	 No!'
Phoebe	 But she just came up here!'
Chandler	 That was Joey!'
Phoebe	 I wonder where she is. That is so weird.'
Chandler	 Yeah, well, she's probably talking to Richard."
Phoebe	 Would you stop that! Do you wanna know the first thing she said when she\ncame back from her lunch with Richard? She didn't feel anything for him. She loves you!"
Chandler	 Really?'
Phoebe	 Yes! Now, she feels terrible! She really wants to make up! You gotta\nfind her.'
Chandler	 Okay. (He gets up and goes to find her.)'
Phoebe	 Good. (After he leaves, she puts on Joey's gladiator helmet and checks\nherself out in the mirror) I should really start wearing hats!"
The Flight Attendant	 (to another passenger) Welcome to Las\nVegas.'
The Flight Attendant	 (To Rachel) Thank you! (Not sure of\nherself) Enjoy your flight?'
Rachel	 Yes, I did. Thank you very much, it was excellent. (Disembarks)'
The Flight Attendant	 (To Ross) Hope you had a nice flight.'
Ross	 Ohh, it was the best!'

Ross	 I think the check in is that way. (Points)'
Rachel	 Ahh.'
Rachel	 Hello! (She makes a face and the kid laughs harder. Finally, his parents\ndrag him off.) Ohh, kids love me.'
Phoebe	 (sees Ross and Rachel) Hey!'
Ross	 Phoebe! (They hug.) '
Phoebe	 You guys are here! Yay!'
Rachel	 Hi! (Hugs Phoebe)'
Phoebe	 (sees Rachel's face) What? Did you go to a costume party? Let me guess\numm Pancho Vila? (Points at Rachel) and you're Bob Saget. (An old lady has sat down at the\nslot machine Phoebe was just at.)"
Rachel	 Pancho Vila?'
Phoebe	 Yeah! (Motions to her face, indicating all of Rachel\'s\n"make-up.")'
Rachel	 What are you talking about Pheebs? (Takes out her compact) I don't\xc2\x85\n(She gasps when she looks in the mirror and sees her face.) (To Ross) Oh my God, you drew\non me?!"
Ross	 Hey, you wet my pants!'
Phoebe	 Whoa, what kind of party was this?'
Rachel	 Ross, I have been walking around like this since the plane! I\ncan\xc2\x97you have so crossed a line. (Heads for the bathroom)'
Ross	 Rach! Wait! The men's room is that way. (Points in the other direction.\nRachel hits him with her purse and heads for the ladies room.)"
Phoebe	 Ugh!'
Ross	 What?'
Phoebe	 That's like the third time that lady's won on a machine I was playing."
Ross	 Oooohhh, I'll bet she's one of those people."
Phoebe	 M-M-Mole people?'
Ross	 What? No-no, a lurker.'
Phoebe	 Oh. What's a lurker?"
Ross	 Okay when you're playing a machine and it hasn't paid out, a lurker waits\nfor you to give up and then\xc2\x85"
Phoebe	 Kills you?'
Ross	 No. They swoop in and steal your jackpot.'
Phoebe	 Ohhh!'
Ross	 Uh-hmm.'
Phoebe	 How do you know about this?'
Ross	 My nana used to do it. That's how she paid for all my dance\xc2\x97karate\nlessons."
Phoebe	 Dance karate?'
Ross	 Yes, it's a deadly but beautiful sport. (Does a karate chop, then does a\nlittle dance-type sway.)"
Rachel	 (returning with her purse covering her face) All right, it won't\ncome off!"
Ross	 What?!'
Rachel	 It won't come off!"
Ross	 Oh my God! Rach-Rach, are-are-are you sure?'
Rachel	 No, actually I took it off then I drew it back on.'
Joey	 (entering) Hey-hey-hey you made it!'
Ross	 Joey!!'
Joey	 All right! Hey-hey!'
Rachel	 Hi!!'
Joey	 Who's your friend? He's hot! (Ross laughs and Rachel smacks him with her\npurse.)"
Ross	 (To Joey) Thanks man.'
Rachel	 Hi. (She hugs Joey.)'
Ross	 Hey listen I uh, talked to Chandler, sorry about the movie.'
Joey	 No, don't be sorry. I don't need it anymore. I found my identical hand\ntwin!"
Ross	 Your what?'
Joey	 My identical hand twin! The person whose hands are exactly like mine! This\nthing is a gold mine!'
Ross	 What?! That's not gonna make you any money!"
Joey	 Okay. Well, if that's how you feel about it, fine! None of you get to live\nwith me in my great big hand-shaped mansion! Except uh, you Pheebs. You can live in the\nthumb."
Monica	 All right baby, come on! (Rolls the dice) Yes! Yes! I am on fire!'
Chandler	 (walking by with his luggage) See you later Mon.'
Monica	 Wait Chandler, what are you doing?!'
Chandler	 What does it look like? I'm going home."
Monica	 What? Wait! Why? (He turns and heads for the door and she chases after\nhim.) Chandler! Chandler! Wait! I\xc2\x92m sorry, I was just playing for one second! I was\ntrying to find you to tell you that, look if you don't want me to see Richard again, I\nwon't! He means nothing to me!"
Chandler	 Come on! I was there! (He's propped up with his hand on a statute of a\nnaked guy. He winces and pulls his hand away.) I know he's the love of your life."
Monica	 Not any more.'
Chandler	 Really?!'
Monica	 Really! (They hug and kiss) All right? Let's forget about this going\nhome stuff and celebrate our anniversary. (She picks up his suitcase.) Okay, this is\nempty."
Chandler	 Yeah, I wanted to make a dramatic scene, but I hate packing.'
Joey	 (entering) Uhh, hey. Where's the other guy?"
The Woman Dealer	 Which guy?'
Joey	 He's kinda tall, dark hair, hand looks exactly like this. (Holds up his\nhand.) See?"
The Woman Dealer	 I don't know about the hands, but the guy that was\nhere before me just went to the bathroom."
Joey	 Okay! (Walks away, then turns back.) How you doin'?"
The Woman Dealer	 Very busy.'
Joey	 Right! Okay. (Heads for the bathroom.)'
Ross	 (on the phone) Yes, hello. I have a question. Umm, I used your pen to draw\non my friend's face. (Listens) A beard and a moustache. (Listens and laughs) Thank you.\n(Rachel turns around and glares at him.) No, she didn't think so. (Listens) I know\nit's like (turns and sees Rachel staring at him and quickly changes the subject) anyway,\numm well make-up didn't cover it and we've tried everything to get it off and nothing's\nworked. What-what do we do? (Listens) Yeah. (Listens) Uh-huh. (Listens) Yeah. (Listens)\nOh! Okay. (Listens) Okay, thank you! (Rachel gets excited at his tone.) (Hangs up the\nphone) Yeah, it's not coming off."
Rachel	 What?! What else did he say?'
Ross	 Umm, he said he thought I was funny. So\xc2\x85(Rachel stares at him.) Okay,\nlook-look umm, let's just go downstairs, we'll have some fun, and you will forget all\nabout it."
Rachel	 Ross, no! There is no way I am leaving this room looking like\nthis!'
Ross	 Oh, come on! Rach, it's-it's not that bad."
Rachel	 Ross, I am a human doodle!!'
Ross	 Look, just because some idiot drew on your face doesn't mean you shouldn't\nhave any fun! Okay? And besides, hey-hey-hey no one is even gonna look at you.\nOkay? This is Vegas! Hello! There are tons of other freaks here! (Rachel turns around and\nglares at him.) There are tons\xc2\x85of\xc2\x85freaks here. No other. No. Come on! No one\nwill notice, I swear!"
Ross	 Okay, there was some staring and pointing.'
Rachel	 Okay, I need a, I need a drink! (Makes a beeline for the mini-bar.)'
