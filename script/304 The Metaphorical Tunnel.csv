Host	 Welcome everybody, welcome to Amazing Discoveries!'
Phoebe	 Oh, oh! It's on again!"
Joey	 You guys, can we please not watch this all right.'
All	 Shhhh!'
Host	 Folks, has this ever happened to you. You go to the refrigerator to get\na nice glass of milk, (Joey is in the background struggling to open a cartoon of milk) and\nthese darn cartons are so flingin'-flangin' hard to open."
Joey	 (on tv) Oh, you said it Mike. (rips open the carton and spills milk on the\ncounter) Aw! There's got to be a better way!"
Mike	 And there is Kevin.'
Joey	 Can we please turn this off?'
Rachel	 Noo way, Kevin.'
Mike	 There is a revolutionary new product that guarantees that you'll never\nhave to open up milk cartons again. Meet the Milk Master 2000."
Ross	 (to Chandler) Are you intrigued?'
Chandler	 You're flingin'-flangin' right I am!"
Mike	 Keep in mind, he's never used this product before, you're gonna see how\neasy this is to do. (to Kevin) Go ahead. ('Kevin' starts using the product, it is a spout\nthat you jab into a paper milk carton so that you don't have to rip it open.) This works\nwith any milk carton."
Joey	 (on TV, finishing installing the Milk Master 2000) Wow, it is easy.\n(starts to poor the milk) Now, I can have milk everyday.'

Chandler	 Well, it's official there are no good movies."
Janice	 Well, let's go to a bad one and make out. (they start to kiss and lean\nback into Monica.)"
Monica	 Perhaps, you would like me to turn like this, (turns sideways on the\ncouch) so that you can bunny bump against my back.'
Joey	 (entering) Hey!'
Phoebe	 Hey.'
Chandler	 Hey, man. What's up?"
Joey	 Maybe you can tell me. My agent would like to know why I didn't show up at\nthe audition I didn't know I had today. The first good thing she gets me in weeks. How\ncould you not give me the message?!"
Chandler	 Well, I'll tell ya I do enjoy guilt, but, ah, it wasn't me."
Phoebe	 Yes, it was! It was him! Uh huh! (they all stare at her) Okay, it was\nme! '
Joey	 How is it you?'
Phoebe	 Well, it was just, it was all so crazy, you know. I mean, Chandler was\nin the closet, counting to 10, and he was up to 7 and I hadn't found a place to hide yet.\nI-I-I meant to tell you, and I wrote it all down on my hand. See, all of it. (shows him\nher hand)"
Joey	 Yep, that's my audition."
Monica	 See, now this is why I keep notepads everywhere.'
Phoebe	 Yep, and that's why we don't invite you to play."
Janice	 What is the great tragedy here? You go get yourself another appointment.'
Joey	 Well, Estelle tried, you know. The casting director told her that I missed\nmy chance.'
Phoebe	 That is unfair. I'll call her and tell her it was totally my fault."
Joey	 Pheebs, you can't do that. The casting director doesn't talk to friends,\nshe only talks to agents."
Phoebe	 What a sad little life she must lead. Okay, ooh (starts dialing). '
Joey	 What, what are you doing? What are you doing?'
Phoebe	 No, no, no, I know, I know, ooh. (on the phone in a different voice)\n'Hi, this is Katelynn, from Phoebe Buffay's office. Um, is um, Ann there for Phoebe,\nshe'll know what it's about.'"
Joey	 Hang up, hang up. (reaches with his good arm, but Phoebe grabs it and he\ntries to reach the phone with his other arm but can't because of the sling.)"
Phoebe	 (on phone) 'Annie! Hi. Listen we got a problem with Joey Tribbiani,\napparently he missed his audition. Who did you speak to in my office? Estelle, no, I don't\nknow what I'm going to do with her. No. All right, so your husband leaves and burns down\nthe apartment, the world does not stop.'"
Chandler	 Is anybody else scared?'
Phoebe	 (on phone) 'Right, well look, um, if Joey loses this audition, that is\nit for Estelle. I don't care! Annie you are a doll, what time can you see him?' (to\nMonica) I need a pen. (Chandler hands her one, but she needs something to right on, so she\ntilts Chandler's head over and writes on the back of his neck)"
Chandler	 Get the woman a pad! Get the woman a pad! A pad! A pad!'
Monica	 Oh, now you want a pad.'
Carol and Susan	 (entering) Hey!!'
Ross	 There's my boy! Here's my boy! And here's his Barbi (Ben is holding a\nBarbi doll) What's ah, what's my boy doing with a Barbi?"
Carol	 He picked it out of the toy store himself, he loves it.'
Susan	 He carries it everywhere, it's like a security blanket, but with ski\nboots and a kicky beret."
Ross	 Yeah, it's, it's, it's cute. Why, why, why does he have it, again?"
Susan	 So he's got a doll? So what? Unless you're afraid he's gonna grow up and\nbe in show business."
Carol	 This doesn't have anything to do with the fact that he is being raised by\ntwo women, does it?"
Ross	 You know what it's fine. If you're okay with the Barbi thing, so\nam I."
Ross	 Give daddy the Barbi! Ben, give, give me the Barbi.\nOkay, how 'bout, don't you want to play with the monster truck? (makes a monster truck\nsound) No. Okay, oh, oh, how about a Dino-soilder? (squawks like a dinosaur)"
Rachel	 Ross, you are so pathetic. Why can't your son just play with his doll?\n(uses the Milk Master 2000 to pour milk into her cereal)"
Monica	 (entering from her bedroom) I gotta go to work. Has anybody seen my left\nboob?'
Joey	 I love that movie. (Joey is using it as a pillow)'
Monica	 There it is. Joey, what are you doing?'
Joey	 I'm sorry, it just felt nice."
Chandler	 (entering with his ringing phone) Joe. Joe! Answer the phone.'
Joey	 Hey, I only got one good arm, you know. You should be doing stuff for me.\nGo get me a sweater.'
Chandler	 Just do it! Okay, it's Janice and if I get it I'm going to have to see\nher tonight. (phone stops ringing) Oh, that's great I'm gonna have to see her tonight."
Rachel	 What's the big deal? Why don't you wanna see Janice?"
Chandler	 Okay, last night at dinner, when the meals came, she put half her\nchicken piccata on my plate and took my tomatoes.'
Ross	 And that's bad because..., you hate chicken piccata?"
Chandler	 Noo.'
Ross	 You didn't want to share your tomatoes, tomatoes are very important to\nyou."
Chandler	 No, it's like all of the sudden, we were this couple. And this alarm\nstarted going off in my head
Rachel	 Men are unbelievable.'
Monica	 What is it with you people! I mean, the minute you start to feel\nsomething, you have to run away?'
Chandler	 I know, that, (looks at her fake chest, and loses his train of\nthought, temporarily) that's why I don't want to go tonight, I'm afraid I'm going to say\nsomething stupid."
Monica	 Oh, you mean like that guy thing where you act mean and distant until\nyou get us to break up with you.'
Joey	 Hey, you know about that?!'
Chandler	 Look what do I do? I wanna get past this, I don't wanna be afraid of\nthe commitment thing. I wanna go through the tunnel, to the other side! "
Ross	 (to Joey) Where there is no fear of commitment.'
Chandler	 Do we have any...(turns around and bumps Monica's fake chest) Do we\nhave any thoughts here?"
Joey	 Well, I've never been through the tunnel myself, 'cause as I understand\nit, you're not allowed to go through with more than one girl in the car, right. But, it\nseems to me it's pretty much like anything else, you know, face your fear. It have a fear\nof heights, you go to the top of the building! If you're afraid of bugs.....get a bug.\nRight. In this case, you have a fear of commitment, so I say you go in there and be the\nmost committed guy there ever was."
Rachel	 Amazingly, that makes sense.'
Chandler	 You think?'
Joey	 Oh, yeah. Go for it man, jump off the high dive, stare down the barrel of\nthe gun, pee into the wind!'
Chandler	 Yeah, Joe, I assure you if I'm staring down the barrel of a gun, I'm\npretty much peeing every which way."
Phoebe	 Oh, it's your audition from this morning. Can I use the phone again?"
Rachel	 Sure Pheebs, you know, that's what it's there for, emergencies and\npretend agents."
Joey	 Come on baby, come on!'
Phoebe	 (on phone, in 'Katelynn's' voice) 'Hi, I have Phoebe Buffay returning a\npage. Okay, well, um, she's in her car I'll have to patch you through.'"
Rachel	 Very nice touch.'
Phoebe	 (in voice, on phone) 'Okay, go ahead.' (in normal voice on phone) Um, hi\nAnnie. (listens) Fantastic! (to Joey) You got it. (on phone) Oh, okay, um, 'Will he work\nfor scale?' you ask me. Well, I don't know about that, (Joey clears his throat to signify\nyes) except that I do and he will. Great, oh you are such a sweetheart. I would love to\nhave lunch with you, how about we have lunch next....(hangs up phone) Op, went through a\ntunnel."
Rachel	 Unbelievable.'
Joey	 Thank you so much.'
Phoebe	 It was really fun, I mean I've never talked on a car phone before."
Joey	 You were amazing, could you just do me this huge favor, you see there's\nthis one other audition that I really, really want, and Estelle couldn't get me in."
Phoebe	 Oh, I don't know. I mean it was fun one time."
Joey	 Come on, please, it'll be just this one more, well actually it's two."
Phoebe	 Two?'
Joey	 Yeah! Well, well really it's three. Please. You're so good at it. I love\nyou."
Phoebe	 Okay, I'll do it, but just these three, right"
Joey	 Nooo, four.'
Janice	 So, how come you wanted to eat in tonight?'
Chandler	 'Cause, I wanted to uh, give you this. (hands her a present)"
Janice	 Ohhh, are you a puppy! (opens it) Contact paper! I never really know\nwhat to say when someone you're sleeping with gives you contact paper."
Chandler	 Well, wait there's, there's more. See the contact paper is to go into\nyour brand new drawer. (gives her a drawer) See, the drawer actually goes in my dresser."
Janice	 Oh, you didn't have to do this."
Chandler	 Yes, I did. Yes, I did. Because, you're my girlfriend, and that's what\ngirlfriends should, should get. "
Janice	 Well, I gotta buy a vowel. Because, oh my Gawd! Who, would've thought\nthat someday, Chandler Bing would buy me a drawer."
Chandler	 Well, not me. But that's what's happened, and, ah, and, and there's\nmore. We should take a trip."
Janice	 We should?'
Chandler	 Yep, we're a couple and that's what couples do. And, I wanna meet your\nparents. We should take a trip with your parents!"
Janice	 (laughs) I don't think we need to, because you're tripping me out right\nnow! Are you okay?"
Chandler	 I am, I actually am. I mean this is amazing. My entire life I have\nfeared this place, and now that I'm here it's like what was the big deal. I could probably\nsay 'Let's move in together.' and I'd be okay."
Janice	 You probably want us to move in together?'
Chandler	 It doesn't scare me!"
Janice	 Yeah, well, it scares me! I mean I not even divorced yet, Chandler. You\nknow, you just invited me over here for pasta, and all of the sudden you're talking about\nmoving in together. And, and I wasn't even that hungry. You know what, it's getting a\nlittle late, and I-I should just, um...(starts to leave)"
Chandler	 Oh, no, no, no, don't go! I've scared ya'! I've said too much! I'm\nhopeless, and awkward, and desperate for love!! (Janice leaves, Chandler then calls Janice\nto leave a message on her machine) Hey, Janice! It's me. Um, yeah, I-I-I just wanna\napologize in advance for having chased you down the street. (runs out the door)"

Rachel	 Honey, this will help. (hands him a tub of ice cream)'
Chandler	 So, I finally catch up to her and she says this relationship is going\nto fast and we have to slow down.'
Rachel and Monica	 Uff.'
Monica	 That is never good.'
Chandler	 Then I got all needy and clingy.'
Rachel	 Okay, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. Maybe it's not so\nbad. How did you leave it?"
Chandler	 She said she'd call me."
Rachel and Monica	 Ohh! (both grab there stomachs in pain)'
Chandler	 Oh God.'
Monica	 Welcome to our side of the tunnel.'
Chandler	 This ice cream tastes like crap by the way.'
Rachel	 Yeah, well that's that lo-cal, non dairy, soy milk junk. We sort of, we\nsave the real stuff for those really terminal cases."
Monica	 You know, when you start get screwed over all the time, you gotta switch\nto low-fat.'
Rachel	 Yeah, you do.'
Chandler	 So, you don't think I'm terminal?"
Monica	 Well, no, not at all, you're not terminal, you just, you just need some\ndamage control."
Chandler	 Okay, okay. So, should I call her?'
Rachel and Monica	 Nooo!'
Rachel	 This is a very critical time right now. If you feel yourself reaching\nfor that phone, then you go shoe shopping, you get your butt in a bubble bath. You want\nher back you have to start acting aloof.'
Monica	 She has to know that your not ready.'
Rachel	 Right. So, what you have to do is, you have to accidentally run into her\non purpose. And then act aloof.'
Chandler	 So I'm not, not gonna lose her?"
Rachel	 Oooh, honey, you're not a total loser."
Chandler	 I said, 'So I'm not gonna lose her?'"
Rachel	 Oh.'
Ross	 Guess who's here. It's the toughest guy in toy land, Ben. (singing) 'A\nreal American hero. I'm G.I. Joe!' Drop the Barbi, drop the Barbi."
Rachel	 G.I. Joe? Do you really think he's gonna fall for that?"
Joey	 (entering) G. I. Joe! Cool! Can I play?'
Ross	 Look Ben, it's a toy that protects U.S. oil interests overseas!"
Joey and Ross	 Go Joe!!!'
Phoebe	 (entering) Helloo! Oh! (sees Joey and starts to leave)'
Joey	 Pheebs! There you are!'
Phoebe	 No it's not, sorry."
Joey	 But Phoebe, wait! Wait! Phoebe. Phoebe! (catches her in the hallway)'
Phoebe	 Oh, Joey! Oh, okay, see I didn't recognize you wearing, in\nthose....pants."
Joey	 Look listen, that TV movie I went in for? Did you hear anything? I think I\ngot a shot at it.'
Phoebe	 Yes! They called and you didn't get it! Okay, I mean you didn't get it,\nI'm sorry, I'm sorry."
Joey	 It's okay, these things happen."
Phoebe	 But they shouldn't happen, you know what, you're, you're in a terrible,\nterrible business. Oh God, I don't wanna be the person who makes your face look like that."
Joey	 I'm, I'm okay. See. (tries to smile, but fails horribly)"
Phoebe	 Oh, now you're sad and creepy, oh. You know what, I, I'm sorry I quit,\nokay, I just quit."
Joey	 No! No, no you can't quit! You're the best agent I ever had! Look Pheebs,\nrejection is part being an actor, you can't take it personally."
Phoebe	 Not personal, really, well they said that they never met an Italian\nactor with a worse Italian accent.'
Joey	 They actually said that?'
Phoebe	 Yeah. Ooh God, there's that face again! See I can't do this job! I..."
Joey	 No, no, no, see that's why you have to do this job, agents always lie. You\nknow, Estelle just says stuff like 'They went another way', but this, I can use this. (in\na very bad Italian accent) I canna work on a new accent."
Phoebe	 Yeah okay, no if it helps you okay. Yeah.'
Ross	 (running into the hall, in slow motion) You'll never get me, Joe!!! (he\nthen pretends that he gets shot repeatedly and falls back against Joey and Chandler's\ndoor, dead.)"
Janice	 (to butcher) No, thank you. (Chandler makes a sound and she notices him)\nChandler!'
Chandler	 (in a British accent) Hello, Janice.'
Janice	 What are you doing here?'
Chandler	 (in accent) Oh, just a bit of shopping. How've you been?"
Janice	 Are you being British?!'
Chandler	 (normal voice) No. Not anymore.'
Janice	 Why are you shopping here? You don't live in this neighborhood. Were you\nhere waiting for me?"
Chandler	 Yeah, huh. I'm just uh, you know I'm just picking up some things for a\nparty. (grabs a bag off of the shelf)"
Janice	 Barley? What kind of party serves barley?'
Chandler	 Well, I'm sorry if my friends aren't as sophisticated as yours."
Janice	 Where is this party?'
Chandler	 Here in Chelsea.'
Janice	 Who's party is it?"
Chandler	 A woman's"
Janice	 What woman?!'
Chandler	 (shyly) Chelsea.'
Janice	 Okay, you know, one of two things is happening here. Either you're\nseeing somebody behind my back, which would make you the biggest jerk on the planet. Or,\nelse you're pretending that you're seeing somebody, which just makes you so pathetic that\nI could start crying right here in the cereal aisle. So like which of these two guys do\nyou want to be? (another guy walks by)"
Chandler	 Can I be that guy?'
Phoebe	 Okay, so we got some more good rejections, lots of stuff to work on. '
Joey	 Okay, shoot.'
Phoebe	 Okay, um, oh, the zoo commercial.'
Joey	 I didn't get it?"
Phoebe	 No. They said you 'Weren't believable as a human being.' So, you can\nwork on that. "
Joey	 Okay, what else?'
Phoebe	 Um, the off-Broadway play people said 'You were pretty but dumb.'"
Joey	 Oh.'
Phoebe	 Oh no wait, I'm sorry, that's 'pretty dumb.'"
Joey	 Look, it's okay, no, no, no, really, look um, I really appreciate this\nPheebs, but I think I'm gonna have to go back to Estelle."
Phoebe	 Oh.'
Joey	 Yeah, well don't get me wrong, you're a better agent than she is, but at\nleast with her I don't want to blow my pretty dumb brains out."
Phoebe	 Yeah, no, I understand.'
Joey	 You do, thanks.'
Phoebe	 Yeah. Sorry. (she starts to leave)'
Joey	 Wait a minute.'
Phoebe	 What?'
Joey	 Wait a minute, did you just make up all that stuff just to get out of\nbeing my agent.'
Phoebe	 (in a coy tone) Oh, you caught me. I am so busted.'
Joey	 (in a really, really bad Italian accent) That's-ah what I suspected-ah."
Chandler	 ....And then I just, you know, threw the bag of barley at her, and ran\nout of the store.'
Monica	 My God! Chandler, we said be 'aloof' not 'a doof'."
Chandler	 I've actually ruined this haven't I? It's time for the good ice cream\nnow, right?"
Rachel	 Yeah, it is.'
Monica	 You know what, everything's gonna be okay. "
Chandler	 (answering phone) Hello. Hi, Janice! Can you hold on for a second?\nOkay. (to Monica and Rachel) Okay, what do I do?'
Rachel	 Shhh...I don't know what to do, this is totally unprecedented."
Monica	 If-if-if we ever did what you did a man would never call.'
Rachel	 Yeah.'
Chandler	 Hello!'
Monica	 Oh wait, you know what, I got it, I got it, pretend like you just woke\nup, okay, that will throw her off. Be sleepy.'
Rachel	 Yes, and grumpy.'
Chandler	 What are you, stop naming dwarves! (on phone) Hello, Janice. Hi, I'm\nso glad that you called, I know I've been acting a really weird lately. And, it's just\nbecause I'm crazy about you, and I just got...stupid, and, and scared, and....stupid a\ncouple of more times. I'm sorry. (listens) Really?! (listens) Really?!"
Rachel	 He's soo lucky, if Janice were a guy, she'd be sleeping with somebody\nelse by now."
Chandler	 (on phone) I love you too.'
Monica	 Aw, it's soo unfair. (they both start digging into the 'good' ice cream)"
Carol	 G. I. Joe. G. I. Joe?!'
Ross	 Hey, I don't know what to tell you guys that's the doll he chose."
Susan	 What'd you do, dip it in sugar?"
Ross	 Look, G. I. Joe's in, Barbi's out. And if you guys can't\ndeal with it, that's your 'too bad.'"
Monica	 What are you being such a weenie for? So he has a Barbi, big deal. You\nused to dress up like a woman.'
Ross	 What?'
Monica	 Well, you used to dress up in Mom's clothes all the time."
Ross	 What are you talking about?'
Monica	 The big hat, the pearls, the little pick handbag.'
Ross	 Okay, you are totally making this up.'
Monica	 How can you not remember? You made us call you...Bea. '
Ross	 (remembering) Oh God.'
Susan	 I've literally never been this happy."
Monica	 Wasn't there a little song?"
Carol	 Oh please God, let there be a song.'
Ross	 There was no song. (to Monica) There was no song!'
Monica	 (singing) 'I am Bea.'"
Ross	 Okay.'
Monica	 'I drink tea.'"
Ross	 Okay, that's, that's enough. (retreats to the bathroom)"
Monica	 '....Won't you, won't you, won't you.... '"
Ross	 (coming out of the bathroom) Won't you dance around with me. "
Monica	 A-ha!!! (they all start laughing, as Ross hides in the bathroom)'

Young Ross	 (singing) 'I am Bea. I drink tea. Won't you dance\naround with....' (spills some tea and it drips onto his/her dress) Ohhh! (runs away\ncrying)"
Young Monica	 (entering the shot) Ross!!! (starts to wipe up\nthe spill)'
