Chandler	 Ross! It\xc2\x92s got your wavy black lines!'
Monica	 All right, so now that Ross knows can you tell us y\xc2\x92know how it\nhappened? I mean, when did it happen? How many times did it happen?'
Phoebe	 Monica! That\xc2\x92s not right! Start with where.'
Rachel	 Well it happened about six weeks ago, and uh I had just got home from\nwork and Ross was already there \xc2\x91cause I guess he had been hanging out with Joey.'
Joey	 You\xc2\x92re welcome buddy.'
Ross	 (glaring at him) Yeah, thanks. (Joey nods no problem.)'
Rachel	 And so I had a lot of work to do so Ross, nice guy that he is, offered\nto help me out. And then we had a little wine, we got to talking, and the next thing you\nknow out of nowhere Ross comes on to me.'
Ross	 (laughs) Umm that\xc2\x92s\xc2\x85that\xc2\x92s a little misleading.'
Rachel	 What is?'
Ross	 The lie you just told.'
Rachel	 That-that you came on to me?'
Ross	 There\xc2\x92s the one!'
Rachel	 But you did! I mean, let\xc2\x92s be honest.'
Ross	 Yes let\xc2\x92s. Y\xc2\x92know what? Uh, it\xc2\x92s-it\xc2\x92s not important.\nWhat is important is that, is that we\xc2\x92re having a baby. And it\xc2\x92s\nnot\xc2\x97Doesn\xc2\x92t matter who came on to who.'
Joey	 Whom. (Everyone looks at him shocked.) That\xc2\x92s right.'
Rachel	 You know you kissed me first.'
Ross	 What? What?! You were begging me to kiss you! You-you-you were sending me\nsignals all over the place!'
Rachel	 I was sending you signals?'
Ross	 Yeah!'
Rachel	 Oh please. Okay, anyone in this room think that I would send Ross\nbegging symbols, please show of hands. (Ross raises his hand and no one else.)'
Ross	 Y\xc2\x92know what?! It doesn\xc2\x92t matter! It doesn\xc2\x92t matter what you\nbelieve! What matters is what happened!'
Rachel	 Okay. So these signals Ross, explain this to me, \xc2\x91cause maybe I\nneed to be more careful. I mean, am I sending you these signals right now?'
Ross	 Y\xc2\x92know what? Y\xc2\x92know what? Rachel, just-just drop it.'
Rachel	 No please, show me how I begged you!'
Ross	 I can show you, I have it on videotape! (Stunned silence) It\xc2\x92s an\nexpression.'

Phoebe	 I can\xc2\x92t believe he taped the two of them having sex!'
Joey	 Yeah! You gotta tell a girl before you tape her. Such a rookie mistake.'
Chandler	 Y\xc2\x92know who has a great video camera?'
Phoebe	 (nasally) Greg and Jenny?'
Monica	 Do you still wanna call \xc2\x91em? I wanna call \xc2\x91em.'
Chandler	 Let\xc2\x92s call \xc2\x91em.'
Joey	 Yeah! Ask them if they brought their friends any souvenirs!'
Monica	 (on phone) Hello? (Listens) Eighth street deli?'
Joey	 Hey, hang up! You get food poisoning just talkin\xc2\x92 to that place.'
Monica	 (on phone) Uh sorry, wrong number. (Hangs up)'

Monica	 (on phone) Hello? (Listens) (To All) It\xc2\x92s the deli again!'
Joey	 All right! I\xc2\x92ll have a sandwich!'
Monica	 (hangs up) I don\xc2\x92t think this number\xc2\x92s right!'
Chandler	 What?'
Phoebe	 You got fake numbered.'
Monica	 What?! People don\xc2\x92t do that!'
Joey	 Oh I think we do.'
Monica	 They gave us a fake number? Why? Why would they do that?'
Chandler	 I don\xc2\x92t know! You were a delight to talk to. You asked all those\ninsightful, great questions.'
Monica	 And you\xc2\x92ve never been funnier. Joke, joke, joke, you were a hoot!'
Joey	 Y\xc2\x92know what? Don\xc2\x92t worry about it, you still got me and Phoebe.'
Phoebe	 Excuse me, I don\xc2\x92t want Greg and Jenny\xc2\x92s rejects.'
Ross	 (entering) Rachel won\xc2\x92t talk to me! She won\xc2\x92t even open the\ndoor!'
Phoebe	 Hmm, I wonder why. Pervert!'
Ross	 Okay, listen I am not a pervert!'
Phoebe	 That\xc2\x92s like the pervert motto! Yeah! Yeah! They have you raise your\nright hand, put your left hand down your pants, and repeat that!'
Ross	 Filming Rachel is not something I planned. Okay look, here\xc2\x92s what\nhappened, and Joey you-you can back me up on this. All right, about-about a month and a\nhalf ago I came to you with a problem? Umm, a personal thing. '
Joey	 Personal thing? What personal thing? I don\xc2\x92t know.'
Ross	 About\xc2\x85about sex? (Joey looks at him confused) That I hadn\xc2\x92t had\nsex in months?'
Joey	 (laughs) Yeah I knew what you were talkin\xc2\x92 about.'

Ross	 Hey!'
Joey	 Hey.'
Ross	 Do you have a minute? I\xc2\x92d like to talk to you about something\nI\xc2\x92m, I\xc2\x92m really uncomfortable talking about.'
Joey	 Sure. What? About uh, you showering with your mom?'
Ross	 I actually had a topic in mind! I\xc2\x92m, I\xc2\x92m kinda going through a\ndry spell, sex wise.'
Joey	 Whoa, for like months?'
Ross	 Five to be lying, six.'
Joey	 Six months? Whoa that\xc2\x92s rough.'
Ross	 Well, I mean it\xc2\x92s not all bad. I\xc2\x92m learning to appreciate the\nuh, smaller things in life. Like the sound of a bird and the color of the sky.'
Joey	 The sky\xc2\x92s blue Ross and I had sex yesterday!'
Ross	 Please, help me! I have a date tonight. It has to go well\nokay\xc2\x97I\xc2\x92m scared for my health!'

Ross	 Really? Well then tell it to me.'
Joey	 Okay. Now you\xc2\x92re gonna want to have sex with me when you hear it, but\nyou have to remember it is just the story.'
Ross	 (sarcastic) I\xc2\x92ll try to control myself.'
Joey	 Okay. (Clears throat) Years ago, when I was backpacking across Western\nEurope\xc2\x85'

Joey	 Have a nice six more months Ross! (Starts to leave.)'
Ross	 (stopping him) Okay! Okay! Okay. I\xc2\x92m sorry. Please, please, you were\nin Western Europe and?'
Joey	 I was just outside Barcelona hiking in the foothills of Mount Tibidabo. I\nwas at the end of this path and I came to a clearing and there was a lake, very secluded.\nAnd there were tall trees all around. (Whispering) It was dead silent. Gorgeous. (Softly)\nAnd across the lake I saw\xc2\x85a beautiful woman\xc2\x85bathing herself\xc2\x85but she was\ncrying\xc2\x85'
Ross	 (intently listening) Why?'
Kristen	 Umm, this is great wine.'

Do what I do when\nI\xc2\x92m preparing for an audition. Okay? I\xc2\x92ll set you up with my video camera and\nyou can record yourself and-and see what you\xc2\x92re doing wrong.'

Ross	 Hello! Can I get you anything? Huh? Lens cleaner? Your battery okay?\n(Rachel bursts in carrying two boxes and Ross jumps up.) Rachel!'
Rachel	 Oh Ross!'
Ross	 Hi!'
Rachel	 Thank God you\xc2\x92re here! You have to help me! Were you just talking\nto yourself?'
Ross	 That\xc2\x92s less embarrassing, yes. Yes I was.'
Ross	 (voiceover) So when she came in, I got distracted and totally forgot about\nthe camera. [Cut back to the present day.] It kept rolling and recorded everything.'
Chandler	 Yeah, we\xc2\x92re gonna need to see that tape. (They rest of them\nagree.)'
Monica	 Yeah, definitely.'
Ross	 What a great idea! That will get Rachel to forgive me!'
Joey	 Y\xc2\x92know what? This is not fair to her. Let\xc2\x92s just forget the\ntape!'
Ross	 Thank you. (Joey mouths to Ross, "You\xc2\x92ll show me right?")\nNo!'
Joey	 You\xc2\x92re right. (Mouths, "I know you\xc2\x92ll show me, right?)'
Ross	 Joey! No!'
Joey	 Loud and clear! (Mouths, "You\xc2\x92ll show me," and nods.)'
Monica	 I still don't get why Greg and Jenny would give us a fake number."
Joey	 Y\xc2\x92know, if they knew what they were doing they probably didn\xc2\x92t\ngive you real names either.'
Monica	 Okay, maybe people give out fake numbers, but they don\xc2\x92t give out\nfake names.'
Joey	 Oh yeah? (To Phoebe) Hi, Ken Adams, nice to meet you.'
Phoebe	 Regina Philange. (Ken and Regina shake hands.)'
Chandler	 I still don\xc2\x92t get it, we didn\xc2\x92t do anything wrong.'
Monica	 I know! Although, you did tell an awful lot of jokes.'
Chandler	 I thought you said those jokes were funny. Joke! Joke! Joke!'
Monica	 (rolling her head from side to side) Joke. Joke. Blah! Blah! (Joey and\nPhoebe laugh.)'
Chandler	 Well maybe it was all of your questions.'
Monica	 What about my questions?'
Chandler	 The sheer volume, it was like flying with the Riddler!'
Monica	 Oh, I\xc2\x92m sorry. Was that another joke?'
Chandler	 (angrily) Was that another question?'
Rachel	 (entering) Hey! Is Ross still here?'
Joey	 Uh no Rach, he\xc2\x92s gone. But listen, he told us what happened and it\ndoes, it sounds like an honest mistake.'
Rachel	 Oh really? Well how would you like it if I had sex with you and I taped\nit? (Joey smiles luridly) Oh forget it! (Ross enters.) Oh there he is now, the father of\nmy child, the porn king of the west village.'
Ross	 Look, it was accident! Okay? I-I feel bad that it happened, but I swear, I\ndidn\xc2\x92t even watch it! Anyway, here. (He takes the tape out of his coat pocket.) I\nthought you might be more comfortable destroying it yourself. (Tosses her the tape.)'
Rachel	 Thank you. (She sets it on the floor and is about to stomp on it with\nher shoe when the rest of the gang jumps up and yells simultaneously.) What? (They all\nyell again.) You don\xc2\x92t want to see this do you?'
Monica	 Hell yeah!!!'
Rachel	 I am not gonna show you this!'
Phoebe	 No! Not the sex part, just the stuff leading up to it.'
Ross	 Forget it, she\xc2\x92s destroying it.'
Phoebe	 Okay fine! Fine! We\xc2\x92ll just have to think of some other way to put\nthe whole \xc2\x91Who came onto who,\xc2\x92 thing to rest! Come on now, think!!'
Ross	 Look, forget it Phoebe. Okay? It\xc2\x92s Rachel\xc2\x92s tape and she can do\nwhatever she wants with it. And she wants to destroy it. So, end of story.'
Rachel	 I wanna see it.'
Ross	 What?!'
Rachel	 Clearly you don\xc2\x92t want people to see this tape. Now I don\xc2\x92t\nwant people to see this tape either, but you so badly don\xc2\x92t people to see it makes me\nwant to see it. You see?'
Joey	 (confused) Are we watchin\xc2\x92 the tape or not?!'
Ross	 I don\xc2\x92t want people to see it for your sake.'
Rachel	 Ahh, I don\xc2\x92t believe you. I think you don\xc2\x92t want them to see\nyou begging me. (Goes to put the tape in the VCR)'
Ross	 Rachel, please\xc2\x85'
Rachel	 Ah, a little preview!'
Ross	 Fine. Fine, but I want the record to show that I tried to take the high\nroad, because in about five minutes I\xc2\x92m gonna be saying\xc2\x85(He laughs and points at\nRachel sarcastically.)'
Rachel	 Okay, here we go. (Pushes play.)'
Ross	 (on tape) Hello! Can I get you anything?'
Joey	 (To Phoebe) I\xc2\x92m so happy!'

Rachel	 (on tape) Oh, thank God you\xc2\x92re here! You have to help me! Were you\njust talking to yourself?'
Rachel	 There I am.'
Phoebe	 You\xc2\x92re gonna get pregnant.'
Rachel	 (on tape) I screwed up so bad, I told Monica that I would stuff and send\nall these wedding invitations like weeks ago and I-I\xc2\x85'
Ross	 (on tape) You didn\xc2\x92t do it?'
Rachel	 (on tape) I-I know\xc2\x97I had put them in\xc2\x85in-in my desk at work and\nI completely forgot about them until today.'
Monica	 (taking Rachel\xc2\x92s hand) Sweetie okay. It\xc2\x92s okay. Everybody made\nit to the wedding. I\xc2\x92m fine.'
Rachel	 Kinda hurtin\xc2\x92 my hand though.'
Monica	 I know.'
Rachel	 (on tape) (Ross hands her a glass of wine) I cannot believe that I did\nthis. Especially after Monica just went on and on and on about it! (Mimicking Monica)\n"Okay Rachel! Here are the invitations Rachel! Now be very careful Rachel! Please,\ndrinking no liquids around the invitations Rachel!" (She tilts her wine glass above\nand moves it back and forth across the invitations) Whoa oh! Oh-oh-oh!\nOh\xc2\x85oh-oh-oh\xc2\x85'
Chandler	 Did you do it on our invitations?!'
Ross	 (pause) Not on the ones we sent out.'
Chandler	 So, just the ones gave back to us and we had framed! (Slams the framed\ninvitation down onto the table.)'
Rachel	 (on tape) Can you believe this is already happening? I mean it seems\nlike yesterday they just got engaged.'
Ross	 (on tape) I know. Hey remember\xc2\x85remember the night they got engaged?\nHow uh, you and I almost\xc2\x85'
Rachel	 (on tape) Oh, I remember how we almost. Do you think we would\xc2\x92ve\ngone through with it? Y\xc2\x92know, if we hadn\xc2\x92t gotten caught. Do you think we\nwould\xc2\x92ve done it?'
Ross	 (on tape) I mean I\xc2\x85I know I wanted to. I just, I just wasn\xc2\x92t\nsure if you wanted to.'
Rachel	 (on tape) Oh I wanted to.'
Ross	 (on tape) So we\xc2\x85we both wanted to.'
Rachel	 (on tape) Interesting.'
Ross	 (on tape) Yeah. (Pause) Anyway umm, it probably worked out for the best.'
Rachel	 (on tape) Oh yeah, sure.'
Rachel	 Okay, in about ten seconds you\xc2\x92re gonna see him kiss me.'
Ross	 And in about five seconds you\xc2\x92re gonna see why.'

Rachel	 Okay, get ready to see some beggin\xc2\x92!'
Phoebe	 Oh, you came on to Ross!'
Rachel	 What?!'
Ross	 Now I\xc2\x92m so happy.'
