Ross	 Happy birthday!!!'
Monica	 Happy birthday!!!'
All	 Rach! Come on! Rach!'
Monica	 It\xc2\x92s your birthday!'
Tag	 (entering from her room) Hey.'
Chandler	 (To Monica) She\xc2\x92s not as pretty as she was when she was 29.'
Tag	 Ms. Green would like to establish some ground rules before she comes out.\nShe would appreciate it if you don\xc2\x92t use the words old or downhill or (To Joey) they\nstill look pretty damn good. (Joey smiles and everyone glares at him.)'
Joey	 They do!'
Phoebe	 Rachel! Come on out! Monica made breakfast!'
Monica	 Chocolate-chip pancakes!'
Ross	 We\xc2\x92ve got presents!'
Rachel	 Good ones?'
Monica	 They all came from the list you handed out to us two weeks ago.'
Rachel	 Well, can I keep the presents and still be 29?'
Joey	 Come on Rach! Look, turning thirty is not that big a deal.'
Ross	 Oh really. Is that how you felt when you turned thirty?'
Joey	 (screaming) Why God?!! Why?!! We had a deal!! Let the others grow old! Not\nme!! (He buries his head in Phoebe\xc2\x92s lap for comfort.)'
Rachel	 Y\xc2\x92know, I\xc2\x92m still 29 in Guam.'
Ross	 Hey, 30 is not that old! Do you know how old the Earth is?'
Rachel	 Late thirties? Oh come on you guys! Is it just me? Am I overreacting to\nthis?'
Chandler	 No Rach, it\xc2\x92s not just you. My thirtieth birthday certainly\nwasn\xc2\x92t that much fun.'
Joey	 (screaming) And now Chandler! We\xc2\x92re all gettin\xc2\x92 so old! (Looking\nup) Why are you doing this to us?! (Turns away crying.)'

Monica	 Rach, you\xc2\x92re in a great place in your life. Come on, you\xc2\x92ve\ngot a great job! Good friends\xc2\x85'
Joey	 Yeah, you\xc2\x92re roommate is a soap opera star.'
Rachel	 Look, y\xc2\x92know I know my life\xc2\x92s going pretty well, but I look\naround and I just see so many people who\xc2\x92ve accomplished so many other goals by the\ntime they\xc2\x92re thirty.'
Phoebe	 Yeah, but you shouldn\xc2\x92t compare yourself to me.'
All	 Come on Phoebe! You can do it Phoebe! Come on!'
Rachel	 There you go!'
Phoebe	 I did it! One mile on a hippity-hop! That\xc2\x92s it!! That\xc2\x92s\neverything I wanted to do before I was thirty. Oh, except I wanted to patch things up with\nmy sister. But oh well. Yay!! (They all cheer again.) And-and girls this thing is a\nGodsend if you know what I mean. (Rachel and Monica look intrigued and as they all head\ninto Central Perk, Rachel picks up the hippity-hop that Phoebe left behind.)'
Rachel	 Thirty. Ugh, I mean thirty! Monica, do you remember mean, old Mrs.\nKreeger in the fifth grade? She was thirty!'
Tag	 Come on, let\xc2\x92s have some fun. Huh? (To Rachel) What do you want to do\ntoday?'
Rachel	 Nothing. I don\xc2\x92t want to do anything.'
Monica	 Well, doing nothing on your thirtieth is better than doing something\nstupid, like Ross.'
Ross	 Hey! That was a practical purchase! I needed that car for transportation!\nOkay? I-I have a child!'
Ross	 How hot do I look in this, huh?!'
Chandler	 Ross, a sports car? Wouldn\xc2\x92t it have been cheaper to just stuff a\nsock down there?'
Ross	 That\xc2\x92s not what this is about okay? I-I am a sports car enthusiast. I\nhave always been into cars.'
Joey	 Hey, what\xc2\x92s the horsepower on this thing?'
Ross	 (giddy) I don\xc2\x92t know, but-but look how shiny!'
Monica	 I can\xc2\x92t believe you bought this.'
Rachel	 Really! God Ross, what were you thinking? (To Phoebe, quietly) I know\nit\xc2\x92s really shallow, but a part of me wants him again.'
Phoebe	 Oh, well get in line missy. (To Ross) So, can I have a ride stud?'
Ross	 Hop in. (Phoebe hops in.) Get ready for the smoothest ride of your life. '
Ross	 Damnit! (Shuts the car off.)'
Phoebe	 (getting out) Okay, who\xc2\x92s next?'
Rachel	 Y\xc2\x92know what? I am going to do something today. I\xc2\x92m not just\ngonna sit around like some old lady. I\xc2\x92m gonna get something pierced. Like my uh,\nlike my nose or my tongue or something.'
Phoebe	 Really?! \xc2\x91Cause y\xc2\x92know that hurts.'
Rachel	 So what?! Y\xc2\x92know what? The way I see it\xc2\x97(Phoebe pulls out a\nhair from the back of her head)\xc2\x97Ow! Son of a bitch!!'
Tag	 Look Rachel, I know what you\xc2\x92re going through. I\xc2\x92m totally\nfreaked about turning 25.'
Rachel	 (glares at him) Get out, get out of my apartment. '
Monica	 All right Rach, for what it\xc2\x92s worth, I think that you\xc2\x92re doing\ngreat. I mean y\xc2\x92know let\xc2\x92s face it, no one handles this well.'
Phoebe	 Least of all you.'
Tag	 Why? What you\xc2\x92d do?'
Monica	 Weren\xc2\x92t you asked to leave sonny?'
Chandler	 (To Joey) Would you put that back on?! Monica\xc2\x92s gonna be here any\nminute!'
Joey	 But it hurt\xc2\x92s my Joey\xc2\x92s Apple.'
Chandler	 (frustrated) Okay, for the last time. It\xc2\x92s not named for each\nindividual man.'
Mrs. Geller	 (To Chandler) You\xc2\x92ve done a wonderful job with this party\nChandler. Everything looks so lovely.'
Chandler	 Oh well, not as lovely as you. I mean, I can\xc2\x92t believe that you\nwould have a thirty-year-old daughter! (To Mr. Geller) And you! I can\xc2\x92t believe that\nyou would have a tux that\xc2\x92s thirty years old! (Puts his hand on Mr. Geller\xc2\x92s\nshoulder.)'
Mr. Geller	 It\xc2\x92s older than that. Ross was actually conceived right near\nthis tuxedo.'
Chandler	 Ohh! (He quickly removes his hand and looks at it.)'
Rachel	 (entering) Hey! Everybody hide! Hide! I saw her! She\xc2\x92s coming!'
Chandler	 Okay! Okay! Everybody down! Everybody down! (Rachel turns off the\nlights and everyone crouches. As everyone crouches, a ripping noise erupts from the\nassemblage.)'
Mr. Geller	 Crap.'
Chandler	 (getting up to investigate) Okay, everybody stay here. I will find out\nwhat\xc2\x92s going on.'
Monica	 Heyyy!! You got the door open!! (Giggles.)'
Chandler	 Hey-hey are you drunk?'
Monica	 Nooo! (Giggles) Okay. (She tries to pull herself up by Rachel and\nJoey\xc2\x92s doorknob, but the door opens and she almost falls into the their apartment.\nShe manages to catch herself.) Whoa! (Stands up, unsteadily) Okay. See I was, I was a\nlittle nervous about turning (whispering) thirty. (Giggles.) So the bus boys took me out\nfor some drinks. (Pause) I wanna puke on you later!'
Chandler	 Okay, here is the thing. We have thrown a very formal surprise\nparty for you in there! All of your friends are in there and your parents!'
Monica	 Noo!!!'
Chandler	 Yes!'
Monica	 Noo!!'
Chandler	 Yes!!'
Monica	 Oh no! My parents have never seen me drunk! (Pause) That they know of.'
Chandler	 Okay, here\xc2\x92s the thing. We\xc2\x92re gonna get you some coffee and\nthey will never know that you\xc2\x92re drunk.'
Monica	 Really?! You promise?'
Chandler	 Yeah, I\xc2\x92ll take care of it.'
Monica	 Okay. I love you so much. (Kisses him.)'
Chandler	 (laughing) Okay we have to do something about your breath.'
Monica	 What about your breath?! (Breathes on him.)'
Chandler	 That\xc2\x92s still yours. Okay, now remember it\xc2\x92s a surprise\nparty. So, when you go in, act surprised.'
Monica	 Okay. I can do that.'
Chandler	 Okay.'
All	 Surprise!!!'

Ross	 Okay, forward. Forward\xc2\x97Stop! (The car moves an inch and Ross runs to\nthe back of the car.) Okay, back\xc2\x97Stop! (The car barely moves and Ross runs back to\nthe front.) Okay, forward\xc2\x97Stop! Stop! Stop!'
Monica	 Ross, just forget about it. This guy\xc2\x92s got you totally wedged in.'
Woman	 (To Joey) Is this yours?'
Joey	 Well actually\xc2\x85'
Ross	 No-no-no! It\xc2\x92s mine! It\xc2\x92s-it\xc2\x92s mine. (The woman walks\naway.)'
Joey	 Dude, you soooo need this car.'
Phoebe	 (running up) Okay. Okay, here\xc2\x92s what we\xc2\x92re gonna do. Okay,\nI\xc2\x92m gonna break into this mini-van and put it in neutral. You guys push it forward so\nRoss can drive out of his spot. Okay? All right, here we go. (She opens her coat and\nreveals that thing car thieves use to break into cars as Ross jumps in behind the wheel.\nShe inserts the device, unlocks the door, opens it, and the alarm goes off.) Haul ass!!!!\n(Runs off.)'
Phoebe	 Happy thirtieth birthday! Here! (Hands her the hippity-hop.) It\xc2\x92s\nfor the child in you, and the woman. Happy thirtieth!'
Ursula	 Right, why do you keep saying that?'
Phoebe	 Because it\xc2\x92s our thirtieth birthday.'
Ursula	 Yeah, no we\xc2\x92re not thirty. We\xc2\x92re 31. Okay. (She closes the\ndoor.)'
Phoebe	 Wait! (Knocks on the door and Ursula opens it.)'
Ursula	 Oh, it\xc2\x92s you.'
Phoebe	 Yeah. What?!'
Ursula	 Yeah, we\xc2\x92re not thirty, we\xc2\x92re 31.'
Phoebe	 Nu-uh!'
Ursula	 Yea-huh! That\xc2\x92s what is says on my birth certificate.'
Phoebe	 You have your birth certificate?'
Ursula	 Yeah, I got a big box of family stuff when my mom died.'
Phoebe	 Our mom.'
Ursula	 (sarcastic) Right! Okay. (Hands Phoebe her births certificate.)'
Phoebe	 Do you have my birth certificate?'
Ursula	 No, I sold it to a Swedish runaway.'
Phoebe	 (reading the certificate) Oh my God! Oh my God, we are 31.'
Ursula	 Yeah.'
Phoebe	 I just lost a whole year of my life.'
Ursula	 (sarcastic) Okay.'
Phoebe	 Your middle name is Pamela?'
Ursula	 Yes.'
Phoebe	 Well, I never knew mine. Do you remember what it is?'
Ursula	 Yes! Phoebe.'
Phoebe	 That\xc2\x92s my first name.'
Ursula	 Right, okay, then no.'
Chandler	 Okay before we start the celebration, Monica has to go put on her\nparty dress.'
Monica	 Yay!'
Chandler	 See? (Does his laugh.) Here we go. (Starts walking her to their room,\nand has to pass in front of Mr. Geller who\xc2\x92s sitting at the table and Mrs. Geller\nwho\xc2\x92s standing next to him.)'
Mr. Geller	 Happy birthday, sweetie! Give us a hug! (Starts to get up.)'
Mrs. Geller	 (stopping him) Don\xc2\x92t get up Jack! The safety pins are about to\nblow.'
Monica	 (sees someone) Paul!'
Chandler	 (correcting her) Phil.'
Monica	 Phil!'
Chandler	 Now, there is a dress laid out on your bed. (Monica stumbles on the\nsteps.) Okay, (catches her) you\xc2\x92re doing great. You\xc2\x92re doing great. You\xc2\x92re\ndoing fine.'
Phoebe	 Hey, what\xc2\x92s going on?'
Chandler	 Monica\xc2\x92s a little drunk.'
Phoebe	 Yay! I love drunk Monica!'
Monica	 Awwwww\xc2\x85 (Giggles.)'
Chandler	 (To Monica) Go change! (To Phoebe) She doesn\xc2\x92t want her parents\nto know she\xc2\x92s drunk.'
Phoebe	 Ohh! All right! All right. Here\xc2\x92s what we\xc2\x92ll do, I\xc2\x92ll get\ntwice as drunk as Monica and then no one\xc2\x92s will even notice her.'
Rachel	 What\xc2\x92s-what\xc2\x92s going on? Phil\xc2\x92s really pissed!'
Chandler	 Monica\xc2\x92s wasted.'
Ross	 Maybe that will liven up this party.'
Chandler	 (To Rachel) Okay, will you just go help her change please!'
Rachel	 Okay, but taking care of a drunk, naked woman seems like a job for Joey.'
Joey	 Yep. (Starts for Monica\xc2\x92s room, but Chandler stops him.)'
Tag	 (handing his to her) This one\xc2\x92s from me.'
Rachel	 Ahh!'
Tag	 It wasn\xc2\x92t on your list, but hopefully you\xc2\x92ll think it\xc2\x92s\nreally fun.'
Rachel	 (opening it) A scooter! (She\xc2\x92s not happy.)'
Ross	 (to Tag) Stick to the list. Always stick to the list.'
Rachel	 No! No-no, I love it. Thank you. (Kisses him.) '
Chandler	 Okay, open ours next. Open ours next!'
Rachel	 Okay.'
Joey	 Now that you\xc2\x92re a couple, we don\xc2\x92t get two presents from you\nguys?'
Chandler	 For my last birthday you gave me a hug! (To Rachel) Okay, read\nthe card! Read the card!'
Rachel	 Okay. (Opens the card and reads it.) Happy birthday Grandma! It\xc2\x92s\nbetter to be over the hill (starting to cry) then buried under it. (Breaks down as\neveryone glares at them.) All our love Monica and Chandler. (Crying) That\xc2\x92s funny,\nyeah!'
Chandler	 No-no-no-no! That was the joke!'
Rachel	 (crying) No, I know! I get it! It\xc2\x92s funny!'
Chandler	 No, because you\xc2\x92re not a grandmother!'
Rachel	 No I know, because to be a grandmother you have to be married and have\nchildren and I don\xc2\x92t have any of those things. That\xc2\x92s why it\xc2\x92s so funny.\n(Runs into her room crying.)'
Monica	 All you had to do was buy the card!'
Ross	 Hey! Look who\xc2\x92s back! It\xc2\x92s the birthday girl! How\xc2\x92s the\nbirthday girl feeling?'
Rachel	 Well, I feel fine, but I think you\xc2\x92re bumming out the rest of the\nkids.'
Ross	 What? (Glances over and sees the faces of the rest of the group, then goes\nand sits down.)'
Rachel	 Okay! Y\xc2\x92know what? I realized it was stupid to get upset about not\nhaving a husband and kids. All I really needed was a plan. See I wanna have three\nkids\xc2\x85'
Phoebe	 Oh let me guess, and you wanna have them all at the same time and you\nwanna have them for your brother.'
Rachel	 As I was saying\xc2\x85 I should probably have the first of the three kids\nby the time I\xc2\x92m 35 which gives me five years. I love this plan! I wanna marry this\nplan!'
Phoebe	 If you could do that, I\xc2\x92d marry the hippity-hop.'
Rachel	 So, if I wanna have my kid when I\xc2\x92m 35, I don\xc2\x92t have to get\npregnant until I\xc2\x92m 34. Which gives Prada four years to start making maternity\nclothes! Oh wait, but I do want to be married for a year before I get pregnant\xc2\x85'
Monica	 Really! That long?! (Chandler slowly turns and looks at her.) (To\nChandler) Look all you want, it\xc2\x92s happening!'
Rachel	 No, so I don\xc2\x92t have to get married until I\xc2\x92m 33! That\xc2\x92s\nthree years, that\xc2\x92s three whole years\xc2\x97Oh, wait a minute though. I\xc2\x92ll need a\nyear and a half to plan the wedding, and I\xc2\x92d like to know the guy for a year, year\nand a half before we get engaged\xc2\x85 Which means I need to meet the guy by the time\nI\xc2\x92m thirty.'
Ross	 Which is fine! Because you just turned\xc2\x97(Removes two candles\nfrom the cake)\xc2\x97twenty-eight!'
Rachel	 No! Ross, no! It is not fine! Eh-eh-according to my plan I should\nalready be with the guy I wanna marry!'
Joey	 Will you quit hoggin\xc2\x92 it!'

Rachel	 (To Chandler) I\xc2\x92m telling you it\xc2\x92s like watching Bambi learn\nhow to walk.'
Ross	 (To Monica) You\xc2\x92re drunk! Mom and dad are gonna be maaaaadd! Maybe\nI\xc2\x92m a little drunk.'
Chandler	 (to a waiter) Oh that\xc2\x92s great! Right there! Can we get some of\nthat over here please? (The waiter comes over) There we go.'
Joey	 (to the waiter) Hey! Are those crab cakes? (The waiter nods) Did I not\ntell ya to come straight to me when more crab cakes were ready?'
Chandler	 (To Monica) How are you feeling?'
Monica	 You are so handsome! I wanna make love to you right here, right\nnow! (Growls and pulls him into a kiss.)'
Ross	 I really wish that you wouldn\xc2\x92t.'
Chandler	 (To Monica) Now all you have to do is just get through a little bit\nmore, okay? Then we can put you in bed, okay? Just smile and don\xc2\x92t talk to anyone.'
Phoebe	 (clinking two glasses together) Speech! Speech! Let\xc2\x92s hear from the\nbirthday girl! Huh?'
Chandler	 Pheebs!!'
Phoebe	 Don\xc2\x92t you see? Everyone\xc2\x92s looking at me! The plan\xc2\x92s\nworking! I didn\xc2\x92t even have to take off my top yet!'
Mrs. Geller	 Speech! Come on Monica!'
Ross	 Come on!'
All	 Come on! Speech!'
Mr. Geller	 (filming this) Hey Chandler, you can\xc2\x92t keep your hands off her\nfor one second!'
Mrs. Geller	 Oh-ho, I think it\xc2\x92s nice.'
Chandler	 I think it\xc2\x92s necessary. (Backs away anyhow.)'
Monica	 I-I-I wanna thank you all for coming. My family and my friends\xc2\x85'
Phoebe	 (screaming) Wooo!! Hoo!!'
Monica	 I really like to say that I\xc2\x92m-um\xc2\x85 (Pause) Y\xc2\x92know what\nI\xc2\x92d really like to say? I\xc2\x92m drunk!! (Mrs. Geller pulls the camera down.)\nThat\xc2\x92s right mom and dad your little Harmonica is hammered!! (Ross grabs the camera\nout of his dad\xc2\x92s hands.) And guess what! I\xc2\x92ve been drunk before! And I\xc2\x92ve\nsmoked a cigarette! And I got a box of Ding-Dongs hidden in my underwear drawer!\nIt\xc2\x92s all okay. It\xc2\x92s okay because I turned thirty today. And, and I can do\nanything I want! Because I am a grown up. (Falls over sideways with Ross filming\nthe fall.)'
Phoebe	 (To Joey) Okay quick, help me get this off! (Motions to her top.)'
Joey	 Yeah!!'
Phoebe	 I lost a whole year! I can\xc2\x92t believe it! This is so unfair!'
Joey	 Oh, I don\xc2\x92t know Pheebs. It\xc2\x92ll be okay.'
Phoebe	 Will it? Will it?! I mean, how would you feel if you found out you were\n31?'
Joey	 That\xc2\x92s not gonna happen. No. (Looks up) Because we have a new deal!'
Phoebe	 Plus, it totally ruined my schedule! I\xc2\x85I haven\xc2\x92t done any of\nthe things I wanted to do by the time I was 31!'
Joey	 Like what?'
Phoebe	 Like okay I-I-I, I haven\xc2\x92t met any Portuguese people! I, I\nhaven\xc2\x92t had the perfect kiss! And I haven\xc2\x92t been to sniper\xc2\x92s school!'
Monica	 Phoebe, y\xc2\x92know why don\xc2\x92t we just go upstairs and have some\nbirthday cake?'
Phoebe	 No, I just feel like being by myself for a while. All right? I\xc2\x92ll\nsee you guys later. Thanks. (Gets up and exits.)'
Rachel	 Hey. (After she leaves.) Oh, poor Pheebs.'
Joey	 Hey, y\xc2\x92know what you guys? I think I\xc2\x92m gonna go walk her home.\n(Gets up and runs out.) '
Monica	 Oh man!'
Chandler	 What?'
Monica	 He\xc2\x92s gonna eat the cake!'
Joey	 Pheebs! Wait up! (She stops.) Listen uh, close your eyes. (She does so and\nJoey passionately kisses her.) Maybe that\xc2\x92s one thing you can cross off your list.'
Phoebe	 Oh yeah.'
Joey	 Oh, and plus I\xc2\x92m 1/16th Portuguese.'
Phoebe	 Oh! (Phoebe walks away smiling.)'
Ross	 Okay, is everybody clear? We\xc2\x92re gonna pick it up\xc2\x85and move it.\nNow all we need is teamwork, okay? We\xc2\x92re gonna lift the car\xc2\x85and slide it\nout. Lift and slide!'
Rachel	 Ross, I really don\xc2\x92t think\xc2\x85'
Ross	 (interrupting her) Lift!! And slide!'
Chandler	 Okay, here we go.'
Ross	 All right everyone, lift! (They and try to lift the car, of course it\ndoesn\xc2\x92t raise up) And slide!! (Everyone leans over, but the car still does not move.)'
Rachel	 Hey Joey, can I\xc2\x85'
Joey	 Oh, come on Rach! My turn just started!'
Rachel	 Actually, I just wanna talk to Tag.'
Joey	 Oh. Okay. Hey, can I ride this outside?'
Rachel	 Whatever! Okay, I\xc2\x92m not your mother.'
Joey	 Okay! (Runs off downstairs.)'
Rachel	 Not in the street!!'
Joey	 Yes!'
Rachel	 (to Tag) Hi.'
Tag	 Hey.'
Rachel	 Hey.'
Tag	 How are you doing? Are you feeling any better?'
Rachel	 Yeah, I\xc2\x92m doing okay. I\xc2\x92m um\xc2\x85let\xc2\x92s talk.'
Tag	 Okay. (They sit on the step.)'
Rachel	 Umm\xc2\x85'
Tag	 What\xc2\x92s up?'
Rachel	 Ohh Tag, umm\xc2\x85you\xc2\x92re such a great guy and we have sooo much fun\ntogether but I don\xc2\x92t-I don\xc2\x92t\xc2\x85'
Tag	 Wait! I think I see where you\xc2\x92re going, but before you say anything\nelse, can I just say one more thing? (Kisses her.)'
Rachel	 Well said. And a uh good example of the fun I was referring to uhh, but\nI just think I\xc2\x92m past the point where I think I can y\xc2\x92know, just have fun.'
Tag	 Rachel, don\xc2\x92t do this. This is just because you\xc2\x92re turning\nthirty.'
Rachel	 Yeah, it is! But you\xc2\x92re just a kid! I mean you\xc2\x92re 25!'
Tag	 Twenty-four actually.'
Rachel	 Oh God! Y\xc2\x92know what I wish? I wish you were six years older. Well\nactually, if I\xc2\x92m wishin\xc2\x92 for stuff, I actually wish I was six years younger.'
Tag	 Me too.'
Rachel	 Yeah, I\xc2\x92m sorry. (They hug.)'
Chandler	 Hey! How\xc2\x92d it go?'
Rachel	 Oh, if I only want two kids, can I keep him for another year?'
Phoebe	 You did the right thing.'
Joey	 (entering, limping, and holding his arm) I don\xc2\x92t like this anymore.\n(He sits down with them in pain.)'
Chandler	 Well, here we are, just a bunch of thirty year olds.'
Ross	 God, do you realize in ten years we\xc2\x92re gonna be 40?'
Joey	 (crying) Why God?! Why are you doing this to us?! (He buries his head in\nRoss\xc2\x92s shoulder.)'
Ross	 Yes! My baby\xc2\x92s finally free! '
Joey	 All-all right! (They run and jump in the car.) Start it up! Let\xc2\x92s go!'
Ross	 (starting it) Woohoo!'
The Man In The Sportscar	 How hot are we? (He drives off.)'
Ross	 You wanna buy a car?'
Joey	 No.'
