Joey	 Okay, pick a card.'
Chandler	 Okay. (He picks the 9 of Spades)'
Joey	 All right now, memorize it. (Pause) You got it?'
Chandler	 Oh yes.'
Joey	 (holding up the Queen of Clubs) Is that your card? (He winks and smiles.)'
Chandler	 (pause) Yes. '
Carol	 (entering with Ben and Ross) Hey guys!'
Ross	 Hi!'
Chandler	 Hi there!'
Ben	 Hi!!'
Carol	 Guess what? Ben is going to be in a TV commercial!'
Phoebe	 What are you talking about?!'
Ross	 (sets Ben down) Well, it's not for sure but umm, we met this guy in the\npark who thought Ben was really cute--y'know, which he is--so umm anyhoo, he uh, he gave\nus his card and told us to bring him down for this commercial he's auditioning."
Joey	 (reading the card) Whoa! This guy is like the biggest commercial casting\ndirector in town! (Ross gasps) Ben takes one lousy walk in the park and gets an audition!!\n(Ross and Carol stare at him, then Joey realizes what he just said.) I mean, way to go\nBen! (Gives Ben the thumbs up, which Ben returns.) Man! I've been in that park a million\ntimes and no one offered me an audition."
Ross	 I know, it's crazy! We were just pushing Ben on the swings\xc2\x85"
Joey	 I'm always on the swings! What am I doing wrong?!"
Chandler	 That.'
Rachel	 (entering from her room) Okay, gotta go! Wish me luck!'
Joey	 Luck!'
Chandler	 Hey Rach, now that you're working at Ralph Lauren, can you\nbring me back some of those polo shirts?"
Rachel	 Uh well, y'know what? I don't think if I feel comfortable stealing on my\nvery first day\xc2\x85"
Chandler	 Unwilling to steal from work, interesting.'
Monica	 Besides, if anybody's gonna get free stuff, it's gonna be me."
Rachel	 Okay guys, way to wish me luck!'
All	 Good luck! Go get 'em! (Rachel exits.)"
Phoebe	 Okay, let's discuss Rachel's birthday. I say we throw a surprise party\nthis weekend."
Joey	 Whoa-whoa, but her birthday isn't like for another month."
Phoebe	 Yeah but if we throw her a party on her birthday, then it's not a\nsurprise."
Monica	 I think it's a great idea. Yeah, we could have a dinner party and just\ninvite her close friends."
Joey	 Ross!! We're having a surprise party for Rachel!!"
Ross	 (from the bathroom) Okay!!'
Joey	 Done.'
Phoebe	 Okay, great so do you want to do it together?'
Monica	 I would love to do it together!'
Joey	 They're gonna do it together."
Chandler	 Dude! That's my girlfriend!"
Joey	 What, so I gotta shut it down now?'
Ross	 All right, I gotta take off. I'm picking up Ben then we're off to the big\naudition."
Monica	 It's gonna be weird to watch some actor pretending to be Ben's dad."
Ross	 Yeah.'
Chandler	 Weirder than watching his two moms make out? (Monica nods in\nagreement.)'
Joey	 Whoa-whoa dad? There's a dad in the commercial?"
Ross	 Yeah the dad and Ben eat soup and pretend to enjoy it.'
Joey	 Whoa, hey, maybe I'll go down there with ya and see if I can get an\naudition to play the dad. I mean who better to play Ben's father than his godfather."
Ross	 You're not his godfather."
Joey	 What?! Are you kidding?!'
Ross	 (Pause) Of course I am! (Joey is relieved) Okay, let's go godfather."
Joey	 All right!'
Joey	 Hey! I'm in, they're gonna let me audition!"
Ross	 Really? That's great!"
Joey	 I know! I know! It turns out that one of the casting ladies has actually\nseen me in a play, so I steered clear of her\xc2\x85'
Carol	 (noticing a kid who has picked up a copy of Variety to read) Hey,\nthat kid looks familiar.'
Joey	 Oh yeah, yeah! He's done tons of commercials. I've seen him in like Sugar\nSmacks, Playstation, and that one for the phone company. In fact he was so good in\nthat one, he actually convinced me to switch phone companies. Chandler was mad\xc2\x85."
Ross	 Yeah well, he's not gonna get this one. Ben is way cuter than that kid. I\nmean look at him, look at you, (Starts to whine like a baby and Joey just glares at him.)"
Joey	 That's great. Listen, wouldn't it be great though if I got to play Ben's\ndad?"
Ross	 Joey, you look nothing like Ben.'
Joey	 I look more like him than you do! (He winks at Carol.)'
Carol	 Y'know, I don't really know you well enough for you to do that."
Kim	 So it's down to these two, Nancy I know you like this one and I think I\nagree. Rachel, what do you think?"
Rachel	 Well umm, that one is pretty but uh, I just, I just love this fabric (On\nthe other one.) Sorry.'
Kim	 Oh don't be sorry, that's part of your job here to give your opinions and\nthen I take credit for them--I'm kidding."
Nancy	 She is kidding, but don't ever disagree with her again. Okay, now I'm\nkidding!"
Rachel	 (laughing nervously) Oh, what a fun office.'
Kim	 I don't know which one, but I do know I need a cigarette. So what do you\nsay we take a break, we go outside, and we'll figure this out when we come back?"
Kim	 (at the door) Rachel? Do you smoke?'
Rachel	 Oh no, my dad's a doctor and he would always tell me just horror\nstories\xc2\x85(stops and tries to change directions)\xc2\x85about ghosts and goblins who\ntotally supported the princess's right to smoke."
Rachel	 \xc2\x85and then they came back from smoking and they had made all of the\ndecisions without me!'
Monica	 That doesn't seem fair."
Rachel	 I know! It's like I'm being punished for not having this disgusting,\npoisoning habit!"
Chandler	 Yeah, it is the best.'
Rachel	 I mean what if this keeps happening? Y'know, they'll-they'll be outside\nsmoking, making all the decisions and I'll just be up in my office breathing my stupid\nclean air, y'know? And then when the day comes when Kim wants to promote one of us, who do\nyou think she's gonna pick? Me or Smokey Smokerson?"
Monica	 Rachel, you can go down there, you don't have to smoke. Just say you\nwanna get some fresh air."
Rachel	 Yeah, I can do that.'
Chandler	 Yeah, or you can do the easy thing and smoke.'
Phoebe	 (entering) Hey!'
Monica	 Hey!'
Phoebe	 Hey Rach, you wanna get some coffee?'
Rachel	 I would love to!'
Phoebe	 Oh good!'
Chandler	 Yeah, I wanna go to babe.'
Phoebe	 Oh good.'
Phoebe	 Oh wait, I change my mind! (She slams the door on them.) Okay, let's\ntalk about the party! I have so many ideas! (Holds up a cocktail napkin.)"
Monica	 Yeah, me too! (Runs and grabs her 3-ring binder of ideas.)'
Phoebe	 Oh, look at that.'
Monica	 All right, that's a little sketch of the cake, umm some sample menus,\numm y'know what I thought we would start out with Tuscan style finger food, and for music,\nhere's an alphabetized list of all my CDs! I've highlighted the ones that would go really\ngood with the food."
Phoebe	 What happened to the intimate dinner party?'
Monica	 Oh, we're not doing that. Okay\xc2\x85"
Phoebe	 So wow, it looks like you took care of everything. Thanks a lot,\nco-host.'
Monica	 What?! I didn't take care of everything, there's-there's plenty of\nthings for you to do!"
Phoebe	 Like what?'
Monica	 (Thinks) Cups.'
Phoebe	 Cups? You're giving me cups?"
Monica	 And ice!'
Phoebe	 Cups and ice? Ooh, I get to be in charge of cups and ice? (Thinks of\nsomething) All right. Fine, okay, I will be in charge of cups and ice!'
Monica	 Wait a minute, I can get ice at the restaurant\xc2\x85'
Phoebe	 I got it! Mine!'
Ross	 (entering, downtrodden) Hi.'
Monica	 Hey! How'd the audition go?!"
Ross	 Not so good.'
Monica	 Wait a minute, are you doing Joey\'s (sadly) "Audition didn\'t go so\nwell. (Happily) Yeah it did?"'
Ross	 (Pause) Yeah I am! Yeah, Ben got a second audition!'
Joey	 (also downtrodden) Yeah, I had to teach Ross my bit because I actually\ndidn't get a callback."
Monica	 You got a callback too didn't you?"
Joey	 (Happily) Yeah I did!'
Kim	 Hey Rachel, what are you doing out here?'
Rachel	 Oh well, it's kinda lonely up there, so I just thought I would come out\nhere and get some fresh air."
Kim	 Nancy and I were talking about the fall collection.'
Rachel	 Oh great!'
Kim	 So anyway we really\xc2\x85 (Someone exhales and Rachel turns and coughs.)\nHoney, we're just smoking all over you."
Nancy	 Oh, sorry!'
Rachel	 Oh that's okay."
Kim	 No-no-no, we'll move you just stay right there. (They walk away.)"
Nancy	 So anyway I sent the designs over to Ralph and he's very excited about\nthe line."
Kim	 Oh that's great! You are the best!"
Rachel	 Excuse me, can I, can I bum one of those? (He holds up his pack.) Y'know\nwhat, actually\xc2\x85 (She takes the one he's smoking and heads over to where Nancy and Kim\nare standing and laughing.) Okay, okay, okay, what's so funny over here?"
Nancy	 I thought you didn't smoke."
Rachel	 Oh, I thought you guys meant marijuana cigarettes, y\'know? Y\'know what I\nmean, like dubbies? And I actually, I thought to myself, "Wow, those guys are\ncrazy!" But no, I actually smoke the regular ones all, all the time.'
Kim	 We get high.'
Rachel	 Oh, me too.'
Kim	 I'm kidding."
Rachel	 (Laughs) Oh, me too.'
Ross	 Oh God, this is so nerve wracking! How-how do you do this?'
Joey	 Well, unfortunately, I don't get many callbacks so\xc2\x85"
Carol	 Is it a good sign that they asked us to hang around after the audition?'
Joey	 Who knows?'
The Casting Director	 (entering) Okay uh, we have narrowed it down to Raymond,\nBen, Kyle, and Joey. The rest of you, thank you very much.'
Ross	 Yes!! I knew it!! (To the people who didn't make it.) Bye-bye! So long!\nLater!"
Joey	 Oh this is great! I might actually get to play Ben's dad!"
Ross	 Yeah!'
The Casting Director	 Actually, that can't happen. Yeah because you all have\nsuch different looks, we're putting you with Raymond and Kyle with Ben. So it'll be either\nyou two (Points to Joey and Raymond) or you two. (Points to Kyle and Ben.) (Exits.)"
Joey	 Man, this is gonna be kinda weird.'
Ross	 Yeah, it is.'
Kyle	 Yeah. It's gonna be weird."
Ross	 No, we-we're gonna be like best friends, that's why it's gonna be weird."
Kyle	 Oh, oh, I thought we were just talking.'

Phoebe	 (entering, carrying two garbage bags) Hey!'
Ross and Chandler	 Hi!'
Phoebe	 Is it okay if I leave this stuff here 'til Rachel's birthday party?"
Chandler	 Ah sure. What's in 'em?"
Phoebe	 Umm, cups.'
Chandler	 Oh good, because uh we got Rachel 800 gallons of water.'
Ross	 Seriously that's a lot of cups."
Phoebe	 Yeah well, that's 'cause Monica put me in charge of cups and ice, and\nMonica is gonna rue the day that she put me in charge of cups and ice."
Chandler	 Y'know I rued the day once\xc2\x85didn't get a whole lot else done."
Phoebe	 Okay, time to bring up the rest of the cups. (She goes and opens the\ndoor to Joey.) Oh, hi Joey!'
Joey	 Hey Pheebs! (To the guys) Hey!'
Ross	 Hey!'
Joey	 Ross good, I'm uh glad you're here. I wanna talk to you about something."
Ross	 What's up?"
Joey	 Well, I've been thinking about this whole commercial thing, y'know me\ngoing up against Ben, the two of us competing, and that can't lead to anything good. So, I\nthink I'm just gonna step aside. I'm gonna tell them that I won't audition."
Ross	 Wow, uh, Joey that's-that's great. Thanks man."
Joey	 That's it? You're-you're gonna let me do this?! This-this is my career\nwe're talking about here!"
Ross	 Well, you just\xc2\x85'
Joey	 I just said that so you wouldn't let Ben do it! Look Ross, if anyone\nshould step aside it should be Ben!"
Ross	 What?!'
Joey	 What? Chandler! Tell 'em!"
Chandler	 (shocked) Well I mean, let me get the door first. (Goes and opens the\ndoor.) Oh, hi! No one. (Exits.)'
Ross	 Why should Ben step aside? It was his audition in the first place! You-you\njust tagged along! You're like the uh, tag-a-long dad."
Joey	 At least I care about his feelings!'
Ross	 What?!'
Joey	 Do you know how hard this is gonna be on him when he doesn\xc2\x92t get it?'
Ross	 And why wouldn't he get it?"
Joey	 Oh, come on! Have you seen what my kid can do?! Huh?! I mean he\ndials phones! He-he-he eats tortilla chips! He-he plays soccer with the cartoon tiger!'
Ross	 Are you saying your kid eats soup better than my kid?'
Joey	 You just give him a spoon baby!'
Ross	 Oh yeah? I guess we'll just see!"
Joey	 Yeah! Because this commercial belongs to me and Mitch!'
Ross	 You're kid's name is Raymond!"
Joey	 Yeah?! So's yours!"
Monica	 (To Rachel) How did work go?'
Rachel	 Oh it was great! It was great! I went down there just like you said,\ny'know? And we talked business. Kim totally took my opinions."
Monica	 You stink!'
Rachel	 Thanks!'
Monica	 No, I'm-I'm serious!"
Rachel	 Well-well that's 'cause I went down there and they were all smoking.\nThis is actually the smell of success."
Chandler	 Okay, there's something different though--Oh my God! You smoked!"
Rachel	 I did not!'
Chandler	 Yes you did! You look happy and sick; you smoked!'
Rachel	 All right, fine! But I had too! I had to do it for my career!'
Chandler	 I wish I had smoked for my career\xc2\x85'
Monica	 That's so gross!"
Rachel	 No well, no it's not that bad, y'know? I mean yeah, my tongue feels a\nlittle fuzzy and these fingers sort of smell, I actually feel like I can throw up."
Chandler	 Okay, but you gotta push past this because it is about to get so good!'
Monica	 Chandler! I have to tell you, you smell so smokey I have to get up. I'm\nnot kidding. (She's not; she stands and walks away. Chandler moves closer.)"
Chandler	 I think you smell great! (He sniffs her shoulder.)'
Kim	 So, we're decided, no on plaid, yes on pink?"
Nancy	 Absolutely!'
Rachel	 I am so on board! (She throws away her recently lit cigarette.)'
Kim	 Rachel didn't you just light that?"
Rachel	 Yeah, I did, but y'know what? I am really, really trying to cut back,\ny'know? (Laughs) Good luck, Rach."
Nancy	 I've actually been thinking about quitting lately."
Kim	 Oh sure, every Sunday night I'm telling myself I'm quitting but every\nMonday morning it's like (Mimics chain smoking.)"
Nancy	 Tell me about it!'
Rachel	 Well then let's just quit! We'll just quit! Let's all quit!"
Kim	 It does sound appealing.'
Nancy	 Oh, I never could do it.'
Rachel	 Oh but you could. You can. Absolutely! We can help each other out! We\ncan get--what are those--those patches! We could be like the Patch Sisters!'
Kim	 Oh y'know, we really should quit. Okay, let's quit!"
Rachel	 Yes! Great! Give me those cigs! Give it! Give it! (She grabs their\ncigarettes and lighters and throws them in the trash.)'
Kim	 My late husband gave me that lighter. (Rachel laughs.) I'm not kidding."
Rachel	 Okay then! (She starts rummaging through the trash to find Kim's\nlighter.)"
[Scene	 Joey and Ben's audition, Joey is rehearsing his lines, uh correction, Joey is\nrehearsing his line.]"
Joey	 Hmmm, soup! (Tries again.) Hmm soup! (Tries again, with a little\ncaveman thrown in.) Hmm, soup!'
Carol	 Joey, Ross is gonna be here any second, would you mind watching Ben for\nme while I use the ladies' room?"
Joey	 Oh yeah, no problem.'
Carol	 Thanks. (Exits.)'
Joey	 (goes over to Ben) Hi Ben! So you wanna be an actor huh? I gotta tell ya,\nit's no picnic. There's tons of rejection. No stability. One day you're Dr. Drake\nRemoray, the next day you're eating ketchup right out of the bottle."
Ross	 (entering, angrily) Joey!'
Joey	 (angrily) Ross!'
Ross	 (angrily) Ben! (Pause.) (Happily.) I mean, Ben! Ben!'
The Casting Director	 (entering) Okay, Raymond, Joey you're up."
Joey	 Hi!'
The Casting Director	 Okay, uh well, let's try one. Whenever you guys are ready.\n(Some dude puts down a couple bowls of soup in front of them.)"
Joey	 Uh-oh.'
The Casting Director	 Is there a problem?'
Joey	 Well this is noodle soup and uh, I've been working with tomato. But that's\nokay, no problem. No problem. Hmm, noodle soup."
The Casting Director	 Y\'know, that\'s-that\'s fine, but the line is, "Hmm,\nsoup."'
Joey	 Oh, what did I say?'
The Casting Director	 Hmm, noodle soup.'
Joey	 How's that different? (She looks at him until he gets it.) Oh! Yeah!"
The Casting Director	 All right, let's try one."
Joey	 Hmm, noodle soup.'
The Casting Director	 Okay. Let's do it again."
Joey	 Okay.'
Joey	 Hmm, soup. (Pause.) I mean, noodle soup. I mean soup!'
Raymond	 COME ON!!!!'
The Casting Director	 Y'know what? We need to move on."
Joey	 No! No! I-I can do it one more time! See? Look! (Eats another spoonful)\nHmm, noodle soup. Damnit! (Storms out.)'
Rachel	 Hey! Hey-hey-hey!!'
Kim	 Uh-oh, busted!'
Rachel	 Come on you guys! What are doing?! I thought we were the patch sisters!'
Kim	 Yeah. That didn't work out."
Nancy	 Rachel we tried to quit, but it was too hard!'
Rachel	 Well y'know if you, if you started smoking again you could've at least\ntold me! Come on, give me one of those! What are we talking about?"
Kim	 No. No! You're doing great! Don\xc2\x92t you give up! That's why we didn't\ntell you and we're not gonna drag you down with us."
Rachel	 Oh wait, no-no-no! Drag me down. Drag-drag me down.'
Kim	 Forget it Rachel! We're both so proud of how well you're doing. I'm not\ngonna let you blow it. In fact, if I catch you with a cigarette, you're fired. So go on,\nget out of here! Go on, I don't want you breathing this stuff! Go on!"
Rachel	 Okay. (Starts to walk away.)'
Kim	 (to Nancy) So, okay! So you'll come with me on the Paris trip."
Rachel	 (hearing that) Oh man!'
Phoebe	 (To Chandler) Check it out! Cup hat! (Points to her hat.) Cup banner!\nCup chandelier! And the thing that started it all, the cup! (Holds up one.)'
Chandler	 Great job with the cups, Pheebs!'
Monica	 (overhearing that) Why don't you just go out with her!"
Phoebe	 (following him) And did you notice the ice? (Gestures to 3 huge buckets\nof ice on the table.) Look! We have it all! We have crushed! Cubed! And dry! Watch! (Pours\nsome water onto the dry ice, causing it to evaporate/smoke.) Ahhh! Mystical!'
Chandler	 Awesome!'
Monica	 Chandler! Everyone--no one's eating my Tuscan finger food 'cause they're\nall filling up on Phoebe's snow cones!"
Chandler	 There are snow cones! (Monica glares at him.) Snow cones! Yuck!'
Monica	 Y'know\xc2\x85go! Go! Right there! (Points)"
Chandler	 Thank you! Thank you! (Runs to the snow cone machine.)'
Phoebe	 (noticing her) Oh, look! Look! Look!'
All	 Surprise!!'
Rachel	 What?! What?! My birthday's not for another month!"
Monica	 That's the surprise!"
Rachel	 Oh my God! You guys this is so great! I mean it's so unexpected! I mean\nChandler's birthday is even before mine!"
All	 Surprise!'
Rachel	 Wow! This is great! Look at all these cups! This is so weird.'
Phoebe	 I was in charge of cups.'
Rachel	 Oh, okay, not so weird.'
Ross	 Hey!'
Joey	 Hey.'
Ross	 Listen man, uh, I'm sorry the audition didn't go so well."
Joey	 Yeah right! (Gets up for a refill to his snow cone.)'
Ross	 No really, I-I am! I feel bad!'
Joey	 Yeah? Well look Ross, you don\'t have to. Okay? It\'s not your fault I suck.\nI mean what kind of an actor can\'t even say, "Hmm, noodle soup." (Nods his head\nin disgust.)'
Ross	 Yeah y'know what? Maybe-maybe you didn't mess up your audition because you\nsuck, maybe you messed up because you care more about uh, your godson."
Joey	 What you do mean?'
Ross	 I think, sub-consciously\xc2\x85'
Joey	 Wait-whoa-whoa, you lost me.'
Ross	 (pause) I think on some level, you-you sabotaged your own audition so that\nBen would get the part.'
Joey	 Well, you're way sounds a lot better than mine. (Thinks about it.) Yeah.\nYeah! It's not that I'm a bad actor\xc2\x85"
Ross	 No!'
Joey	 No, it's just ah, I care so damn much about little Ben that uh, it was\nmore important to see him succeed."
Ross	 There you go. Thank you!'
Joey	 Thank you! So, did-did he get it?'
Ross	 No.'
Joey	 Eh, what are you gonna do?'

Chandler	 (to Kim and Nancy) Oh, hi! Excuse me, is uh Rachel Green here? I was\nsupposed to meet her for lunch.'
Kim	 Oh, she doesn't come down here any more. You can find her up on ten."
Chandler	 Okay, great.'
Kim	 (to Nancy) So we talked about the (Chandler sneaks closer to her cigarette)\nwhole presentation yesterday at lunch (Closer) and he wondered if one person would be\nenough (Closer) to get a take on the trip (Still closer) and I said, "Yeah,\nabsolutely!" (She\'s interrupted by Chandler who has reached his goal and takes a drag\nfrom her cancer stick.)'
Chandler	 I'll catch you guys later. (Exits.)"
