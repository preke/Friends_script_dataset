The Guys	 (reacting to a play) Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Awww!'
Phoebe	 Hey, it\xc2\x92s your Thanksgiving too, y'know, instead of watching\nfootball, you could help."
The Guys	 We will. (they don\xc2\x92t move)'
Monica	 Okay, Rachel, you wanna put the marshmellows in concentric circles.'
Rachel	 No Mon, you want to put them in concentric circles. I want\nto do this. '
Monica	 Every year.'

Phoebe	 Y'know, for once, I am going to sit down and try to watch one of these\nthings. (just as she sits down)."
Ross	 Halftime.'
Joey	 Hey, who wants to ah, throw the ball around a little, maybe get a little\nthree on three going?'
Rachel	 Oh! That would be sooo much fun!'
Phoebe	 Oh, can I play too? I\xc2\x92ve never played football, like ever. '
Joey	 Great, you can cover Chandler.'
Chandler	 No, no, no, I don\xc2\x92t, I don\xc2\x92t really wanna play.'
Joey	 Come on man! You never want to do anything since you and Janice broke up.'
Chandler	 That\xc2\x92s not true! I wanted to wear my bathrobe and eat peanut\nclusters all day. I wanted to start drinking in the morning. Don\xc2\x92t say that I\ndon\xc2\x92t have goals!'
Joey	 Chandler, you have to start getting over her. All right, if you play, you\nget some fresh air, maybe it\xc2\x92ll take your mind off Janice, and if you don\xc2\x92t\nplay, everyone will be mad at you \xc2\x91cause the teams won\xc2\x92t be even. Come on.'
Chandler	 Yeah, all right, I\xc2\x92ll play.'
Phoebe	 Yay!!'
Rachel	 Let\xc2\x92s do it! Ross?'
Ross	 What?'
Rachel	 Do you wanna play football?'
Ross	 Um, Monica and I aren\xc2\x92t supposed to play football.'
Joey	 Says who? Your mom?'
Monica and Ross	 Yeah.'
Monica	 Well, every, every Thanksgiving um, we used to have a touch football\ngame called the \xc2\x91Geller Bowl.\xc2\x92'
Chandler	 No, no, no, you say that proudly.'
Monica	 Anyway, Ross and I were always captains, and um, it got kind\xc2\x92ve\ncompetitive and one year, Geller Bowl VI, I accidentally broke Ross\xc2\x92s nose.'
Ross	 It was soo not an accident. She saw I was about to tag her, so she\nthrew her big fat grandma arm elbow right into my face. And just keep running.'
Monica	 To score the winning touchdown, by the way.'
Ross	 Whoa, whoa, whoa, ho, ho, ho, you did not win the game, the touchdown\ndidn\xc2\x92t count, because of the spectacularly illegal, oh and by the way savage nose\nbreaking.'
Monica	 (to Chandler and Joey) I won the game.'
Ross	 Oh yeah! Then how come you didn\xc2\x92t get the Geller Cup?'
Rachel	 Um, there was a Geller Cup?'
Ross	 Yes, it was the trophy you got if you won the game. But our Dad said,\n\xc2\x91nobody won that game, \xc2\x91 and he was sick of our fighting, so he took the trophy\nand.... (pauses to collect himself, as he is on the verge of tears saying this) threw it\nin the lake.'
Chandler	 And was the curse lifted?'
Ross	 Anyway. That\xc2\x92s when our Mom said we were not to play football ever\nagain.'
Monica	 Y'know what, I think we should play a game. I mean come on, it\xc2\x92s\nbeen twelve years."
Ross	 Can I see you for a second?'
Monica	 (shouting) Once!!'
Ross	 All right, we\xc2\x92re gonna play.'
Chandler	 But wait a minute though, how are we gonna get there, though, because\nmy Mom won\xc2\x92t let me cross the street.'
Monica	 Okay. Let\xc2\x92s bring it in.'
Rachel	 Wait no, honey, honey throw it to me, throw it to me.'
Ross	 Here you go. (throws her the ball)'
Rachel	 (knocking it down instead of catching it) That almost hit me in the\nface.'
Joey	 All right, we have to pick captains.'
Chandler	 And then Tineals.'
Phoebe	 Okay, so how do we decide that?'
Monica	 Well, why don\xc2\x92t we just bunny up.'
Rachel, Chandler, and Joey	 What?'
Monica and Ross	 (holding both of their hands above their heads making rabbit\nears with their fingers.) Bunny!'
Monica	 Okay, looks like Ross and I are captains. Okay, so um, I bunnied first\nso that means I get to pick first. Joey.'
Joey	 Thank you.'
Rachel	 Monica, I\xc2\x92m your best friend.'
Ross	 Sweetie, don\xc2\x92t worry you\xc2\x92ll get picked. Chandler.'
Rachel	 Ross!'
Monica	 Phoebe.'
Ross	 Sweetie, now I pick you.'
Rachel	 You don\xc2\x92t pick me! You\xc2\x92re stuck with me!'
Ross	 Okay. All right. So let\xc2\x92s see, let\xc2\x92s play from the trash can, to\nthe lightpost. Right. Two hand touch, we\xc2\x92ll kick off.'
Monica	 All right people listen, I\xc2\x92ve got exactly twenty-eight minutes\nbefore I have to baste again.'
Chandler	 Wow! Just like in the pros.'
Monica	 Huddle up.'
Joey	 (to his team) All right, huddle up, right over here.'
Phoebe	 Wait for me! Wait for me! Wait for me! Oh cool, this is my first huddle.'
Monica	 Okay.'
Phoebe	 Okay, so what do you guys really think of Chandler?'
Monica	 Okay, Phoebe you know what you\xc2\x92re doing right?'
Phoebe	 Yeah.'
Monica	 Okay, Joey\xc2\x92s gonna catch it, and you and I are gonna block.'
Phoebe	 What\xc2\x92s block?'
Monica	 Phoebe, I thought you said you know what you\xc2\x92re doing?'
Phoebe	 I thought you meant in life.'
Monica	 Break.'
Chandler	 The ball is Janice. The ball is Janice. (goes to kick the ball but\nkicks Ross\xc2\x92s foot instead.)'
Ross	 Oww!! Son of a...!! Ow! Come on!'
Chandler	 Sorry. I\xc2\x92m sorry. Y'know what, we\xc2\x92re just gonna throw it."
Joey	 I got it. (catches the ball)'
Phoebe	 Go! Go! Go!'
Monica	 Score!! 7 to nothing!'
Rachel	 (coming over to Ross, who is just getting up) Are you okay?'
Ross	 Come on, let\xc2\x92s go!'
Monica	 Losers walk!'
Ross	 Yeah, losers talk!'
Chandler	 No, no, no, actually losers rhyme.'
Chandler	 (coming up under center, just like a real quarterback does, and puts\nhis hands between Ross\xc2\x92s legs.) Twenty-three!! Seventy-four!! (Ross stands up and\nlooks at him) You wanna go shotgun?'
Ross	 Yeah!'
Chandler	 (from the shotgun) Hike!'
Monica and Joey	 One-Mississippi. Two-Mississippi. Three-Mississippi.'
Rachel	 Over here!'
Rachel	 (proud of her self) I almost caught that one!'
Chandler	 Great! Now, the score is 7 to almost 7.'
Ross	 Okay, (to Chandler) this play, I want you to do a down and out to the\nright. Okay. Break!'
Rachel	 Wait, what am I gonna do?'
Ross	 You, you go long.'
Rachel	 Wait, how long?'
Ross	 Until we start to look very small.'
Rachel	 Okay.'
Ross	 Break!!'
Joey	 Set....hike!'
Ross	 One-Mississippi, two-Mississippi, switch! Switch! Switch!!'
Chandler	 No, no, no, no, no!'
Joey	 Haaaaa! Hey-hey, thanks for stopping our ball.'
Woman	 (in a foreign accent) You are playing American football?'
Joey	 Yeah! Wow, your like from a whole other country.'
Woman	 I\xc2\x92m Dutch.'
Joey	 Hi-hi, I\xc2\x92m Joey.'
Woman	 I\xc2\x92m Margha.'
Joey	 I\xc2\x92m sorry Dutch, I didn\xc2\x92t get that last little bit.'
Chandler	 (running up) Hey Joey, do you wanna play football or you wanna.. (sees\nMarhan) Hi, I\xc2\x92m Chandler.'
Margha	 Hello, Chandler.'
Joey	 Her name is Dutch, and also Marklan.'
Margha	 Margha.'
Joey	 Mar-klan.'
Margha	 Mar-gha.'
Chandler	 Mar-haaaan.'
Monica	 Come on guys! Let\xc2\x92s go! Come on, it\xc2\x92s second down.'
Ross	 Uh, hello, it\xc2\x92s third down.'
Monica	 No it\xc2\x92s not, it\xc2\x92s second.'
Ross	 Wow!'
Monica	 Wow, what?'
Ross	 It just amazes me that your still pulling stuff like this.'
Monica	 Pulling what? It\xc2\x92s second down.'
Ross	 Okay, it\xc2\x92s second down. (turns away) Take all the second downs you\nneed.'
Monica	 I heard that!'
Ross	 Well, I said it loud.'
Margha	 It is okay, if I stay and watch?'
Chandler and Joey	 Yeah! Why don\xc2\x92t you stick around. You can sit right\nthere.'
Chandler	 Well, that went well.'
Joey	 I think so.'
Chandler	 Y'know, I was thinking about ah, asking her for her number."
Joey	 Thanks man, but I think it makes a stronger statement if I ask for it\nmyself, y'know."
Chandler	 Whoa-ho, whoa! No, I was thinking about y'know for me, as a part of\nthat whole getting over Janice thing you were talking about."
Joey	 Oh, yeah, that. All right, means that much to ya, I\xc2\x92ll let you have\nher.'
Chandler	 Thanks. What, let me have her?! What do mean? Like if you didn\xc2\x92t\nI wouldn\xc2\x92t have a shot?'
Joey	 Well I don\xc2\x92t like to say it out loud, but, yeah! Don\xc2\x92t feel bad\nman, we all have our strengths. You\xc2\x92re better with numbers and stuff.'
Chandler	 Math!! You\xc2\x92re giving me math! All right, look y'know what, forget\nabout it, you go for the girl, we\xc2\x92ll see who gets her."
Ross	 Chandler, I want you to run a post pattern to the left, okay. And\nsweetie..'
Rachel	 Yeah, I know, go long. Y'know, it\xc2\x92s like all I\xc2\x92m doing is\nrunning back and forth from the huddle."
Ross	 Well ah, you wanna just stay out there?'
Rachel	 Can I see that for second.'
Ross	 Yeah.'
Ross	 Okay. Hut! Hike!'
Joey	 Fumble!'
Joey	 What the hell\xc2\x92s the matter with you?! This is my favourite jersey.'
Chandler	 Well now you have two. Hey, I am good at math.'
Joey	 All right, that\xc2\x92s it. Y'know I was still gonna let you have her. But\nnow, forget about it. Prepare to feel very bad about yourself."
Chandler	 Hey! Well, I\xc2\x92ve been preparing for that my entire life! Or\nsomething about you that\xc2\x92s mean!'
Monica	 All right, come on guys, let\xc2\x92s go! Tie score, and we\xc2\x92re\nrunnin\xc2\x92 out of time. Forty-two!! Thirty-eight!! Hike! (the timer sounds as Monica\nthrows the ball to Phoebe.)'
Phoebe	 Oh I got it!! (catches the ball) Oh! Ew! Broken boob! Ow!'
Joey	 Pheebs, run!'
Monica	 Run, Phoebe, run!'
Phoebe	 Touchdown!! Touchdown!!'
Ross	 Uh, hello, the buzzer buzzed. It doesn\xc2\x92t count.'
Monica	 After the snap!'
Ross	 Before the snap!'
Joey	 After!!'
Chandler	 Before!!'
Rachel	 Now, does it really matter?'
All	 Yes!!'
Phoebe	 Well, okay, I made a touchdown. It was my first touchdown. So?'
Ross	 Oh Pheebs, that\xc2\x92s great. It doesn\xc2\x92t count.'
Monica	 Does so count!'
Ross	 Cheater, cheater, compulsive eater.'
Phoebe	 Oh my God!'
Monica	 Y'know what, that\xc2\x92s fine, maybe you haven\xc2\x92t grown up, but I\nhave."
Ross	 Oh-ho, okay.'
Monica	 Dead leg!! (kicks him in the thigh.)'
Ross	 Ow! Ow! Okay, okay, fine, fine! All right, you wanna win by cheating, go\nahead, all right. Phoebe the touchdown does count, you win.'
Phoebe	 Woo-yay!!'
Monica	 No! Listen, I\xc2\x92m not gonna go through this with you again, okay.\nJust once I wanna beat when you can\xc2\x92t blame it on the broken nose, the buzzer, or the\nfact that you thought you were getting mono. Let\xc2\x92s just call this, tie score and\nit\xc2\x92s halftime.'
Ross	 Okay, first of all, I don\xc2\x92t play with cheaters, and second of all,\nyou know I had swollen glands!!'
Monica	 Y'know what? I\xc2\x92ll think you\xc2\x92ll play."
Ross	 Oh really! Why is that?'
Monica	 Because the winner gets this!'
Ross	 The Geller Cup.'
Chandler	 Is everybody else seeing a troll doll nailed to a two by four?'
All	 Yeah.'
Chandler	 Okay, good.'

Ross	 Okay, where in the hell did you get that?!'
Monica	 When Mom and Dad drove you to the hospital to get your nose fixed, I\nswam into the lake and fished it out.'
Ross	 That cup is mine!'
Monica	 No it\xc2\x92s not! You want it, you\xc2\x92re gonna have to win it!'
Rachel	 All right, so are we not having dinner at all?'
Monica	 Come on Phoebe, let\xc2\x92s go! Come on, it\xc2\x92s time to get serious,\nhuddle up. Joey, keep your head in the game.'
Joey	 It\xc2\x92s hard, y'know, his huddle is closer to Dutch girl."
Monica	 All right look, if I take Chandler out of the running will you be able\nto focus?'
Joey	 What are you gonna do?'
Monica	 All right, you just make sure that Chandler catches the ball, I\xc2\x92ll\ntake care of the rest.'
Joey	 Okay.'
Monica	 Break!'
Joey	 Here you go!'
Ross	 Chandler! Chandler!'
Chandler	 (to Margha) Hi.'
Monica	 Whoa! Whoa!! Tackled by a girl! Bet ya don\xc2\x92t see that everyday, do\nya?'
Ross	 Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What\xc2\x92s with the tackling?'
Monica	 What?! I just touched him and he went over.'
Ross	 Okay, you wanna play rough, we can play rough.'
Phoebe	 I love this game!!'
Ross	 Hey, where\xc2\x92d you get that?'
Rachel	 I went really long.'
Monica	 Forty-two to twenty-one! Like the turkey, Ross is done!'
Ross	 It\xc2\x92s no surprise that your winning, \xc2\x91cause you got to pick\nfirst, so you got the better team.'
Monica	 You\xc2\x92re so pathetic! Why can\xc2\x92t you just accept it, we\xc2\x92re\nwinning because I\xc2\x92m better than you.'
Monica	 Oh, what a great argument, exhaling! All right, y'know what, I\xc2\x92ll\nprove it to you, okay. I\xc2\x92ll trade you Joey for Rachel, and I\xc2\x92ll still win the\ngame."
Ross	 What?! The guys against the girls? See, that\xc2\x92s ridiculous Monica,\nbecause I\xc2\x92m only down by three touchdowns.'
Monica	 Oh, then bring it on! Oh, unless of course your afraid you might lose to\na bunch of girls.'
Ross	 Fine, fine, Rachel your with Monica, Joey you\xc2\x92re with me.'
Rachel	 I can not believe your trading me!!'
Monica	 Come on Rach, come on. Let\xc2\x92s see what\xc2\x92s it like to be on a\nwinning team for a change.'
Rachel	 Are you gonna let me play?'
Monica	 All right then.'
Margha	 (coming over) The game is over, we eat now?'
Chandler	 No-no-no-no, the game\xc2\x92s not over, we\xc2\x92re just switching\nteams.'
Joey	 Yeah, Chandler finds me so intimdating that it\xc2\x92s better if we\xc2\x92re\non the same team.'
Ross	 Right. Okay, let\xc2\x92s play. Let\xc2\x92s go.'
Chandler	 No ah, hold on a second Joe, where do Dutch people come from?'
Joey	 Ah well, the ah, Pennsylvania Dutch, come from Pennsylvania.'
Chandler	 And the other ah, Dutch people, they come on from somewhere near the\nNetherlands, right?'
Joey	 Nice try. (to Margha) See the Netherlands is this make believe place where\nPeter Pan and Tinker Bell come from.'
Margha	 Oh, my.'
Ross	 Enough with geography for the insane, okay? Let\xc2\x92s play some ball,\nguys.'
Joey	 Whoa, whoa, no, no, I-I\xc2\x92m not playing with this guy, now.'
Chandler	 Fine with me.'
Ross	 Okay, y'know what, let\xc2\x92s just cut to the chase here. Okay? Heidi,\nwhich of my boys do you like?"
Chandler and Joey	 What are you doing? What are you doing? What are you doing? '
Margha	 Which do I like?'
Ross	 Yeah, y'know for dating, general merriment, taking back to your\nwindmill..."
Margha	 Well, if I had to chose right now, which by the way I find really weird,\nI would have to say, Chandler.'
Chandler	 Yes!!'
Joey	 Wait a minute! Wait a minute! She obviously didn\xc2\x92t understand the\nquestion.'
Chandler	 Well, you don\xc2\x92t you have Captain Hook explain it to her.'
Margha	 I\xc2\x92m sorry, Joey, that is my chose.'
Chandler	 You hear that! That is her chose, mister I\xc2\x92ll let you have her! I\nwin! You suck! I rule all! A mini-wave in celebration of me!! (does the wave.)'
Margha	 I\xc2\x92m now thinking I would like to change my answer to, no one.'
Chandler	 Wh-what?'
Margha	 I now find you shallow and um, a dork. All right, bye.'
Joey	 Nice going. You just saved yourself a couple months of sex.'
Chandler	 Y'know what, it doesn\xc2\x92t matter, \xc2\x91cause she picked me. Me!\nFrom now on I get the dates and you have to stay home on Saturday nights watching Ready,\nSet, Cook!"
Ross	 Save the breakthroughs for therapy, okay. The clock is ticking. We have no\ntime, and we are losing, we are losing to girls.'
Chandler	 We\xc2\x92re not gonna lose to girls.'
Ross	 Hey! It\xc2\x92s 42-21!'
Joey	 This sucks, I was just up by that much!'
Monica	 Are we playing football or what? Come on you hairy-backed Marries.'
Monica	 We have to do this. We are playing for women everywhere. Okay, just\nthink about every lousy date that you ever had, okay, every guy who kept on the TV while\nyou\xc2\x92re making out...'
Phoebe	 Oh my God! You dated someone with a glass eye too?!'
Monica	 Come on, okay, come on this is for all womankind. Let\xc2\x92s kill\n\xc2\x91um!'
Rachel	 Yeah!!! Kill \xc2\x91um!!!'
Phoebe	 All right, no, well I want to kill them to, but their boys, y'know how\nare we gonna beat three boys?"
Monica	 All right, we still have a minute and a half to go, and we\xc2\x92re down\nby two points. Two points.... (she gets interrupted by the guys, who are doing a\nslow-motion high five.) Phoebe you do a button-hook again. Rachel, you go long.'
Rachel	 No! Come on! Don\xc2\x92t make me go long. Use me. They never cover me.'
Monica	 Honey, there\xc2\x92s a reason.'
Rachel	 God, I\xc2\x92m not lame, okay. I can do something. I can throw, would you\nlet me throw, come on this is my game too.'
Phoebe	 Come on Mon, let her throw the ball.'
Monica	 All right Rachel, you sweep behind, I\xc2\x92ll pitch it to you, you throw\nit down field to Phoebe. All right. Break.'
Rachel	 Thank you! Break!'
Monica	 Thirty-two! Seventy-one! Hike!'
The Guys	 One-Mississippi! Two-Mississippi! Three-Mississippi!'
Rachel	 I\xc2\x92m so sorry! Are you okay?'
Monica	 No! I\xc2\x92m not okay!'
Rachel	 I\xc2\x92m sorry, they were just all coming at me, and I didn\xc2\x92t know\nwhat to do.'
Joey	 (looking at the timer) Thirty seconds left on the timer!'
Chandler	 Okay, okay, so we get to take that stupid troll thing home!'
Monica	 Come on! Come on! Hurry! We\xc2\x92re running out of time! Huddle up!'
Phoebe	 Okay. Oooh! Oh, this is our last huddle, yeah.'
Monica	 All right, Phoebe get open. Rachel, go long.'
Rachel	 (on the verge of tears) Okay.'
Monica	 Break!'
Rachel	 (in triumph) I got a touchdown! We did it!!'
Chandler	 Hey-hey-hey Rachel, funny thing. Actually, the ah, end zone starts at\nthat pole, so you\xc2\x92re five feet short, so we win!'
Phoebe	 Wait-wait-wait-wait! So, explain something to me though, if, if nobody\ntagged Rachel, then isn\xc2\x92t the play still going.'
Ross	 Let go! Let go!'
Monica	 Let go! I\xc2\x92m a tiny little woman!!'
Chandler	 Guys! Guys! Come on! It\xc2\x92s Thanksgiving, it\xc2\x92s not important\nwho wins or loses. The important thing is, (to Joey) the Dutch girl picked me! Me! Not\nyou! Holland loves Chandler! Thank you, Amsterdam! Good night!!'
Monica	 Ow!!'

Rachel	 We should defiantly play football more often. Maybe there\xc2\x92s a like\nleague we could join or something.'
Phoebe	 Isn\xc2\x92t there a national football league.'
Chandler	 Yes. Yes, there is, they play on Sundays and Monday nights.'
Rachel	 Oh shoot! I work Monday nights.'
Phoebe	 Umm, this stuffing is amazing. Do you think we should bring them some?'
Joey	 When they\xc2\x92re hungry enough, they\xc2\x92ll come in.'
Monica	 Let go!'
Ross	 No! You let go!'
Monica	 No!'
Ross	 How come it\xc2\x92s always us left in the field holding the ball?'
Monica	 I don\xc2\x92t know. I guess the other people just don\xc2\x92t care enough.'
Ross	 Hey! It\xc2\x92s starting to snow.'
Ross	 Gimme the this!'
Monica	 Let go!'
