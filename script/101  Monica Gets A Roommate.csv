Monica	 There's nothing to tell! He's just some guy\nI work with!"
Joey	 C'mon, you're going out with the guy! There's\ngotta be something wrong with him!"
Chandler	 All right Joey, be\nnice.\xc2\xa0 So does he have a hump? A hump and a hairpiece?'
Phoebe	 Wait, does he eat chalk?'
Phoebe	 Just, 'cause, I don't want her to go through\nwhat I went through with Carl- oh!"
Monica	 Okay, everybody relax. This is not even a\ndate. It's just two people going out to dinner and- not having sex."
Chandler	 Sounds like a date to me.'
Chandler	 Alright, so I'm back in high school, I'm\nstanding in the middle of the cafeteria, and I realize I am totally naked."
All	 Oh, yeah. Had that dream.'
Chandler	 Then I look down, and I realize there's a\nphone... there."
Joey	 Instead of...?'
Chandler	 That's right."
Joey	 Never had that dream.'
Phoebe	 No.'
Chandler	 All of a sudden, the phone starts to ring.\nNow I don't know what to do, everybody starts looking at me. "
Monica	 And they weren't looking at\nyou before?!"
Chandler	 Finally, I figure\nI'd better answer it, and it turns out it's my mother,\nwhich is very-very weird, because- she never calls me!"
Ross	 (mortified) Hi.'
Joey	 This guy says hello, I wanna kill myself.'
Monica	 Are you okay, sweetie?'
Ross	 I just feel like someone reached down my\nthroat, grabbed my small intestine, pulled it out of my mouth and tied it around my\nneck...'
Chandler	 Cookie?'
Monica	 (explaining to the others) Carol moved her\nstuff out today. '
Joey	 Ohh.'
Monica	 (to Ross) Let me get you some coffee.'
Ross	 Thanks.'
Phoebe	 Ooh! Oh! (She starts to pluck at the air\njust in front of Ross.)'
Ross	 No, no don't! Stop cleansing my aura! No, just\nleave my aura alone, okay?"
Phoebe	 Fine!\xc2\xa0 Be murky!'
Ross	 I'll be fine,\nalright? Really, everyone. I hope she'll be very happy."
Monica	 No you don't."
Ross	 No I don't, to hell with her, she left me!"
Joey	 And you never knew she was a lesbian...'
Ross	 No!! Okay?! Why does everyone keep fixating on\nthat? She didn't know, how should I know?"
Chandler	 Sometimes I wish I was a lesbian... (They\nall stare at him.) Did I say that out loud?'
Ross	 I told mom and dad last night,\nthey seemed to take it pretty well.'
Monica	 Oh really, so that\nhysterical phone call I got from a woman at sobbing 3
Ross	 Sorry.'
Joey	 Alright Ross, look. You're feeling a lot of\npain right now. You're angry. You're hurting. Can I tell you what the answer is?"
Joey	 Strip joint! C'mon, you're single! Have some\nhormones!"
Ross	 I don't want to be single, okay? I just... I\njust- I just wanna be married again!"
Chandler	 And I just want a million dollars! (He\nextends his hand hopefully.)'
Monica	 Rachel?!'
Rachel	 Oh God Monica hi! Thank God! I just went to\nyour building and you weren't there and then this guy with a big hammer said you might be\nhere and you are, you are!"
Waitress	 Can I get you some coffee?'
Monica	 (pointing at Rachel) De-caff. (to All) Okay,\neverybody, this is Rachel, another Lincoln High survivor. (to Rachel) This is everybody,\nthis is Chandler, and Phoebe, and Joey, and- you remember my brother Ross? '
Rachel	 Hi, sure!'
Ross	 Hi. '
Monica	 So you wanna tell us now, or are we waiting\nfor four wet bridesmaids?'
Rachel	 Oh God... well, it started about a half hour\nbefore the wedding. I was in the room where we were keeping all the presents, and I was\nlooking at this gravy boat. This really gorgeous Lamauge gravy boat. When all of a sudden-\n(to the waitress that brought her coffee)Sweet 'n' Lo?- I realized that I was more turned\non by this gravy boat than by Barry! And then I got really freaked out, and that's when it\nhit me
Monica	 Who wasn't invited to the wedding."
Rachel	 Ooh, I was kinda hoping that wouldn't be an\nissue... [Scene
Monica	 Now I'm guessing that he bought her the big\npipe organ, and she's really not happy about it. "
Chandler	 (imitating the characters)\nTuna or egg salad?\xc2\xa0 Decide!'
Ross	 (in a deep voice) I'll have\nwhatever Christine is having."
Rachel	 (on phone) Daddy, I just... I can't marry\nhim! I'm sorry. I just don't love him. Well, it matters to me! "
Phoebe	\xc2\xa0 If I let go of\nmy hair, my head will fall off. '
Chandler	 (re TV) Ooh, she should not be wearing\nthose pants. '
Joey	 I say push her down the stairs. '
Phoebe, Ross, Chandler, and Joey	\xc2\xa0\nPush her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs!'
Rachel	 C'mon Daddy, listen to me! It's like, it's\nlike, all of my life, everyone has always told me, 'You're a shoe! You're a shoe, you're a\nshoe, you're a shoe!'. And today I just stopped and I said, 'What if I don't wanna be a\nshoe? What if I wanna be a- a purse, y'know? Or a- or a hat! No, I'm not saying I want you\nto buy me a hat, I'm saying I am a ha- It's a metaphor, Daddy!"
Ross	 You can see where he'd have trouble."
Rachel	 Look Daddy, it's my life. Well maybe I'll\njust stay here with Monica. "
Monica	 Well, I guess we've established who's\nstaying here with Monica..."
Rachel	 Well, maybe that's my decision. Well, maybe\nI don't need your money. Wait!! Wait, I said maybe!!"
Monica	 Just breathe, breathe.. that's it. Just try\nto think of nice calm things..."
Phoebe	 (sings) Raindrops on roses and rabbits and\nkittens, (Rachel and Monica turn to look at her.) bluebells and sleighbells and- something\nwith mittens... La la la la...something and noodles with\nstring.\xc2\xa0 These are a few...'
Rachel	 I'm all better now."
Phoebe	 (grins and walks to the kitchen and says to\nChandler and Joey.) I helped!'
Monica	 Okay, look, this is probably for the best,\ny'know? Independence. Taking control of your life.\xc2\xa0 The whole,\n'hat' thing."
Joey	 (comforting her) And hey, you need anything,\nyou can always come to Joey. Me and Chandler live across the hall. And he's away a lot."
Monica	 Joey, stop hitting on her! It's her wedding\nday!"
Joey	 What, like there's a rule or something?"
Chandler	 Please don't do that again, it's a\nhorrible sound."
Paul	 (over the intercom) It's, uh,\nit's Paul."
Monica	 Oh God, is it\n6
Joey	 Who's Paul?"
Ross	 Paul the Wine Guy, Paul?'
Monica	 Maybe. Joey
Ross	 He finally asked you out?'
Monica	 Yes!'
Chandler	 Ooh, this is a Dear Diary moment.'
Monica	 Rach, wait, I can cancel...'
Rachel	 Please, no, go, that'd be fine!"
Monica	 (to Ross) Are, are you okay? I mean, do you\nwant me to stay?'
Ross	 (choked voice) That'd be good..."
Monica	 (horrified) Really?'
Ross	 (normal voice) No, go on! It's Paul the Wine\nGuy!"
Phoebe	 What does that mean? \xc2\xa0\nDoes he sell it, drink it, or just complain a lot? (Chandler doesn't know.)"
Monica	 Hi, come in! Paul, this is.. (They are all\nlined up next to the door.)... everybody, everybody, this is Paul.'
All	 Hey! Paul! Hi! The Wine Guy! Hey!'
Chandler	 I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name. Paul,\nwas it?"
Monica	 Okay, umm-umm, I'll\njust--I'll be right back, I just gotta go ah, go ah..."
Ross	 A wandering?'
Monica	 Change!\xc2\xa0 Okay,\nsit down. (Shows Paul in) Two seconds.'
Phoebe	 Ooh, I just pulled out four eyelashes. That\ncan't be good."
Joey	\xc2\xa0 Hey, Paul!'
Paul	 Yeah?'
Joey	 Here's a little tip, she\nreally likes it when you rub her neck in the same spot over and over and over again until\nit starts to get a little red."
Monica	 (yelling from the bedroom)\nShut up, Joey!'
Ross	 So Rachel, what're you, uh... what're you up\nto tonight?"
Rachel	 Well, I was kinda supposed to be headed for\nAruba on my honeymoon, so nothing!'
Ross	 Right, you're not even getting your honeymoon,\nGod.. No, no, although, Aruba, this time of year... talk about your- (thinks) -big\nlizards... Anyway, if you don't feel like being alone tonight, Joey and Chandler are\ncoming over to help me put together my new furniture."
Chandler	 (deadpan) Yes, and we're very excited\nabout it. "
Rachel	 Well actually thanks, but I think I'm just\ngonna hang out here tonight.\xc2\xa0 It's been kinda a long day."
Ross	 Okay, sure.'
Joey	 Hey Pheebs, you wanna help?'
Phoebe	 Oh, I wish I could, but I don't want to."

Phoebe	 (singing) Love is sweet as\nsummer showers, love is a wondrous work of art, but your love oh your love, your love...is\nlike a giant pigeon...crapping on my heart.\xc2\xa0 La-la-la-la-la- (some guy gives her some\nchange and to that guy) Thank you. (sings) La-la-la-la...ohhh!'
Ross	 (squatting and reading the instructions) I'm\nsupposed to attach a brackety thing to the side things, using a bunch of these little worm\nguys. I have no brackety thing, I see no whim guys whatsoever and- I cannot feel my legs."
Joey	 I'm thinking we've got a\nbookcase here."
Chandler	 It's a beautiful thing."
Joey	 (picking up a leftover part) What's this?"
Chandler	 I would have to\nsay that is an 'L'-shaped bracket."
Joey	 Which goes where?'
Chandler	 I have no\nidea.'
Joey	 Done with the bookcase!'
Chandler	 All finished!'
Ross	 (clutching a beer can and sniffing) This was\nCarol's favorite beer. She always drank it out of the can, I should have known."
Joey	 Hey-hey-hey-hey, if you're\ngonna start with that stuff we're outta here."
Chandler	 Yes, please don't spoil\nall this fun."
Joey	 Ross, let me ask you a question. She got the\nfurniture, the stereo, the good TV- what did you get?'
Ross	 You guys.'
Chandler	 Oh, God.'
Joey	 You got screwed.'
Chandler	 Oh my God!'
Monica	 Oh my God!'
Paul	 I know, I know, I'm such an idiot. I guess I\nshould have caught on when she started going to the dentist four and five times a week. I\nmean, how clean can teeth get?"
Monica	 My brother's going through that right now,\nhe's such a mess. How did you get through it?"
Paul	 Well, you might try accidentally breaking\nsomething valuable of hers, say her-'
Monica	 -leg?'
Paul	 (laughing) That's one way! Me, I- I went for\nthe watch."
Monica	 You actually broke her watch?\xc2\xa0 Wow!\xc2\xa0 The worst thing I ever did was, I-I shredded by\nboyfriend's favorite bath towel."
Paul	 Ooh, steer clear of you.'
Monica	 That's right.\n[Scene
Rachel	 Barry, I'm sorry... I am so sorry... I know\nyou probably think that this is all about what I said the other day about you making love\nwith your socks on, but it isn't... it isn't, it's about me, and I ju- (She stops talking\nand dials the phone.) Hi, machine cut me off again... anyway...look,\nlook, I know that some girl is going to be incredibly lucky to become Mrs. Barry Finkel,\nbut it isn't me, it's not me.\xc2\xa0 And not that I have any idea who me is right now, but\nyou just have to give me a chance too... (The maching cuts her off again and she redials.)"
Ross	 I'm divorced!\xc2\xa0 I'm only\n26 and I'm divorced!"
Joey	 Shut up!'
Chandler	 You must stop! (Chandler\nhits what he is working on with a hammer and it collapses.)'
Ross	 That only took me an hour.'
Chandler	 Look, Ross, you gotta\nunderstand, between us we haven't had a relationship that has lasted longer than a Mento.\n\xc2\xa0 You, however have had the love of a woman for four years. \xc2\xa0\nFour years of closeness and sharing at the end of which she ripped your heart out, and\nthat is why we don't do it!\xc2\xa0 I don't think that was my point!"
Ross	 You know what the scariest part is? What if\nthere's only one woman for everybody, y'know? I mean what if you get one woman- and that's\nit? Unfortunately in my case, there was only one woman- for her..."
Joey	 What are you talking about? 'One woman'?\nThat's like saying there's only one flavor of ice cream for you. Lemme tell you something,\nRoss. There's lots of flavors out there. There's Rocky Road, and Cookie Dough, and Bing!\nCherry Vanilla. You could get 'em with Jimmies, or nuts, or whipped cream! This is the\nbest thing that ever happened to you! You got married, you were, like, what, eight?\nWelcome back to the world! Grab a spoon!"
Ross	 I honestly don't know if I'm hungry or horny."
Chandler	 Stay out of my freezer! [Scene
Paul	 Ever since she walked out on me, I, uh...'
Monica	 What?..... What, you wanna spell it out with\nnoodles?'
Paul	 No, it's, it's more of a fifth date kinda\nrevelation."
Monica	 Oh, so there is gonna be a fifth date?'
Paul	 Isn't there?"
Monica	 Yeah... yeah, I think there is. -What were\nyou gonna say?'
Paul	 Well, ever-ev-... ever since she left me, um,\nI haven't been able to, uh, perform. (Monica takes a sip of her drink.) ...Sexually. "
Monica	 (spitting out her drink in shock) Oh God, oh\nGod, I am sorry... I am so sorry...'
Paul	 It's okay..."
Monica	 I know being spit on is probably not what\nyou need right now. Um... how long?'
Paul	 Two years.'
Monica	 Wow! I'm-I'm-I'm glad you smashed her watch!\n"
Paul	 So you still think you, um... might want that\nfifth date?'
Monica	 (pause)...Yeah. Yeah, I do.'
Priest on TV	\nWe are gathered here today to join Joanne Louise Cunningham and\nCharles, Chachi-Chachi-Chachi, Arcola in the bound of holy matrimony.'
Rachel	 Oh...see... but Joanne loved Chachi! That's\nthe difference!"
Ross	 (scornful) Grab a spoon. Do you know how long\nit's been since I've grabbed a spoon? Do the words 'Billy, don't be a hero' mean anything\nto you? "
Joey	 Great story!\xc2\xa0 But, I uh,\nI gotta go, I got a date with Andrea--Angela--Andrea...\xc2\xa0 Oh man, (looks to Chandler)'
Chandler	 Angela's the screamer,\nAndrea has cats."
Joey	 Right.\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0\nIt's June.\xc2\xa0 I'm outta here. (Exits.)"
Ross	 Y'know, here's the thing. Even if I could get\nit together enough to- to ask a woman out,... who am I gonna ask? (He gazes out of the\nwindow.)"

Rachel	 Isn't this amazing? I mean, I have never\nmade coffee before in my entire life."
Chandler	 That is amazing.'
Joey	 Congratulations. '
Rachel	 Y'know, I figure if I can\nmake coffee, there isn't anything I can't do."
Chandler	 If can invade Poland,\nthere isn't anything I can't do."
Joey	 Listen, while you're on a roll, if you feel\nlike you gotta make like a Western omelet or something... (Joey and Chandler taste the\ncoffee, grimace, and pour it into a plant pot.) Although actually I'm really not that\nhungry..."
Monica	 (entering, to herself) Oh\ngood, Lenny and Squigy are here.'
All	 Morning. Good morning.'
Paul	 (entering from Monica's room)\nMorning."
Joey	 Morning, Paul.'
Rachel	 Hello, Paul.'
Chandler	 Hi, Paul, is it?'
Paul	 Thank you!\xc2\xa0 Thank you so\nmuch!'
Monica	 Stop!'
Paul	 No, I'm telling you last night\nwas like umm, all my birthdays, both graduations, plus the barn raising scene in Witness."
Monica	 We'll talk later."
Paul	 Yeah. (They kiss) Thank you. (Exits)'
Joey	 That wasn't a real date?! What the hell do you\ndo on a real date?"
Monica	 Shut up, and put my table back.'
All	 Okayyy! (They do so.)'
Chandler	 All right, kids, I gotta get to work. If I\ndon't input those numbers,... it doesn't make much of a difference... "
Rachel	 So, like, you guys all have jobs?'
Monica	 Yeah, we all have jobs. See, that's how we\nbuy stuff."
Joey	 Yeah, I'm an actor."
Rachel	 Wow! Would I have seen you in anything?'
Joey	 I doubt it. Mostly regional work.'
Monica	 Oh wait, wait, unless you happened to catch\nthe Reruns' production of Pinocchio, at the little theater in the\npark."
Joey	 Look, it was a job all right?'
Chandler	 'Look, Gippetto, I'm a real live boy.'"
Joey	 I will not take this abuse. (Walks to the door\nand opens it to leave.)'
Chandler	 You\'re right, I\'m sorry. (Burst into song\nand dances out of the door.) "Once I was a wooden boy, a little wooden boy..."'
Joey	 You should both know,\nthat he's a dead man.\xc2\xa0 Oh, Chandler? (Starts after Chandler.) "
Monica	 So how you doing today? Did you sleep okay?\nTalk to Barry? I can't stop smiling."
Rachel	 I can see that. You look like you slept with\na hanger in your mouth.'
Monica	 I know, he's just so, so... Do you remember\nyou and Tony DeMarco?"
Rachel	 Oh, yeah.'
Monica	 Well, it's like that. With feelings."
Rachel	 Oh wow. Are you in trouble.'
Monica	 Big time!'
Rachel	 Want a wedding dress? \xc2\xa0\nHardly used.'
Monica	 I think we are getting\na little ahead of selves here. Okay. Okay. I am just going to get up, go to work\nand not think about him all day. Or else I'm just gonna get up and go to work."
Rachel	 Oh, look, wish me luck!'
Monica	 What for?'
Rachel	 I'm gonna go get one of those (Thinks) job\nthings."
Frannie	 Hey, Monica! '
Monica	 Hey Frannie, welcome back! How was Florida? '
Frannie	 You had sex, didn't you? "
Monica	 How do you do that?'
Frannie	 Oh, I hate you, I'm pushing my Aunt Roz through\nParrot Jungle and you're having sex!\xc2\xa0 So? Who? "
Monica	 You know Paul? '
Frannie	 Paul the Wine Guy? Oh yeah, I know Paul. '
Monica	 You mean you know Paul like I know Paul? '
Frannie	 Are you kidding? I take credit for Paul. Y'know before me, there was no\nsnap in his turtle for two years. "
Joey	 (sitting on the arm of the couch)Of course it was a line! '
Monica	 Why?! Why? Why, why would anybody do something like that? '
Ross	 I assume we're looking for an answer more sophisticated than 'to get you\ninto bed'. "
Monica	 I hate men!\xc2\xa0 I hate men!'
Phoebe	 Oh no, don't hate, you don't\nwant to put that out into the universe."
Monica	 Is it me? Is it like I have some sort of\nbeacon that only dogs and men with severe emotional problems can hear? '
Phoebe	 All right, c'mere, gimme your feet. (She starts massaging them.) "
Monica	 I just thought he was nice, y'know? "
Joey	 (bursts out laughing again) I can't believe you didn't know it was a line!\n"
Rachel	 Guess what? '
Ross	 You got a job? '
Rachel	 Are you kidding? I'm trained for nothing! I was laughed out of twelve\ninterviews today. "
Chandler	 And yet you're surprisingly upbeat. "
Rachel	 You would be too if you found John and David boots on sale, fifty\npercent off! '
Chandler	 Oh, how well you know me... '
Rachel	 They're my new 'I don't need a job, I don't need my parents, I've got\ngreat boots' boots! "
Monica	 How'd you pay for them? "
Rachel	 Uh, credit card. '
Monica	 And who pays for that? '
Rachel	 Um... my... father. '
Rachel	 Oh God, come on you\nguys, is this really necessary?\xc2\xa0 I mean, I can stop charging anytime I want. '
Monica	 C'mon, you can't live off your parents your whole life. "
Rachel	 I know that. That's why I was getting married. "
Phoebe	 Give her a break, it's hard being on your own for the first time. "
Rachel	 Thank you. '
Phoebe	 You're welcome. I remember when I first came to this city. I was\nfourteen. My mom had just killed herself and my step-dad was back in prison, and I got\nhere, and I didn't know anybody. And I ended up living with this albino guy who was, like,\ncleaning windshields outside port authority, and then he killed himself, and then I found\naromatherapy. So believe me, I know exactly how you feel. "
Ross	 The word you're looking for is 'Anyway'... "
Monica	 All right, you ready?'
Rachel	 No.\xc2\xa0 No, no, I\'m not\nready!\xc2\xa0 How can I be ready?\xc2\xa0 "Hey, Rach!\xc2\xa0 You ready to jump out the\nairplane without your parachute?"\xc2\xa0 Come on, I can\'t do this!'
Monica	 You can, I know you\ncan! '
Rachel	 I don't think so."
Ross	 Come on, you made\ncoffee! \xc2\xa0 You can do anything! (Chandler slowly tries to hide the now dead plant from\nthat morning when he and Joey poured their coffee into it.)'
Ross	 C'mon, cut. Cut, cut, cut,... "
All	 Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut... (She cuts one of them and they cheer.)'
Rachel	 Y'know what?\xc2\xa0 I think\nwe can just leave it at that.\xc2\xa0 It's kinda like a symbolic gesture..."
Monica	\xc2\xa0 Rachel!\xc2\xa0\nThat was a library card! '
All	 Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut..'
Chandler	 (as Rachel is cutting up\nher cards) Y'know, if you listen closely, you can hear a thousand retailers scream. "
Monica	 Welcome to the real world! It sucks. You're\ngonna love it! "
Monica	 Well, that's it (To Ross) You gonna crash on the couch? "
Ross	 No. No, I gotta go home sometime. '
Monica	 You be okay? '
Ross	 Yeah. '
Rachel	 Hey Mon, look what I just found on the floor. (Monica smiles.) What? '
Monica	 That's Paul's watch. You just put it back where you found it. Oh boy.\nAlright. Goodnight, everybody. "
Ross and Rachel	 Goodnight.'
Ross	 Mmm. (They both reach for the last cookie) Oh, no- '
Rachel	 Sorry- '
Ross	 No no no, go- '
Rachel	 No, you have it, really, I don't want it- "
Ross	 Split it? '
Rachel	 Okay. '
Ross	 Okay. (They split it.) You know you probably didn't know this, but back in\nhigh school, I had a, um, major crush on you. "
Rachel	 I knew. '
Ross	 You did! Oh.... I always figured you just thought I was Monica's geeky\nolder brother. "
Rachel	 I did. '
Ross	 Oh. Listen, do you think- and try not to let my intense vulnerability\nbecome any kind of a factor here- but do you think it would be okay if I asked you out?\nSometime? Maybe? '
Rachel	 Yeah, maybe... '
Ross	 Okay... okay, maybe I will... '
Rachel	 Goodnight. '
Ross	 Goodnight. '
Monica	 See ya.... Waitwait, what's with you? "
Ross	 I just grabbed a spoon. (Ross exits and Monica has no idea what that\nmeans.) '

Joey	 I can't believe what I'm hearing here. "
Phoebe	 (sings) I can't believe what I'm hearing here... "
Monica	 What? I-I said you had a- '
Phoebe	 (sings) What I said you had... '
Monica	 (to Phoebe) Would you stop? '
Phoebe	 Oh, was I doing it again?'
All	 Yes!'
Monica	 I said that you had a nice\nbutt, it's just not a great butt."
Joey	 Oh, you wouldn't know a great\nbutt if it came up and bit ya."
Ross	 There's an image.\n"
Rachel	 (walks up with a pot of coffee) Would anybody like more coffee? '
Chandler	 Did you make it, or are you just serving it? '
Rachel	 I'm just serving it. "
All	 Yeah. Yeah, I'll have a cup of coffee. "
Chandler	 Kids, new dream... I'm in Las Vegas. (Rachel\nsits down to hear Chandler's dream.)"
Customer	 (To\nRachel) Ahh, miss? \xc2\xa0 More coffee? '
Rachel	 Ugh. (To another customer that's leaving.) Excuse me, could you give\nthis to that guy over there? (Hands him the coffee pot.) Go ahead. (He does so.) Thank\nyou. (To the gang.) Sorry.\xc2\xa0 Okay, Las Vegas."
Chandler	 Okay, so, I'm in Las\nVegas... I'm Liza Minelli- "
