Rachel	 Joey? Are you in there?'
Joey	 (hearing Rachel and jumping up with his plate) Oh God! That\xc2\x92s Rachel!'
Monica	 Joey, you have to talk to her!'
Joey	 No-no, I can\xc2\x92t! I can\xc2\x92t! Not after the other night, it\xc2\x92s\njust it\xc2\x92s\xc2\x85too weird, okay? Don\xc2\x92t tell her I\xc2\x92m here! (Turns to run to\nthe bathroom and his bagel falls off the plate onto the floor.) Don\xc2\x92t eat that! (Runs\nto the bathroom as Rachel enters.)'
Rachel	 Hey!'
Chandler	 Hey!'
Monica	 Hey Rachel!'
Rachel	 Is Joey here?'
Chandler	 I don\xc2\x92t see him. (To Monica) Do you see him?'
Monica	 I don\xc2\x92t see him. Hey! Maybe he\xc2\x92s in the sugar bowl! (Opens the\nsugar bowl) Joey? Nope! (Closes the sugar bowl and they both laugh.)'
Rachel	 Well, at least you make each other laugh.'
Monica	 What\xc2\x92s up?'
Rachel	 Well, I haven\xc2\x92t seen him since that night that he told me how he\ny\xc2\x92know\xc2\x85 I don\xc2\x92t know, I think he\xc2\x92s avoiding me. Why is that bagel on\nthe floor?'
Monica	 We were playing a game.'
Rachel	 Ew, was Chandler naked? Sort of like a, like a ring toss kind of\nsituation?'
Monica	 Sure.'
Chandler	 What?! No! No!'
Rachel	 All right. Well listen, if you see Joey will you just tell him\nuh\xc2\x85tell him I miss him. (Exits and Joey enters.)'
Monica	 (To Joey) Okay, did you hear that?'
Joey	 Yeah, a naked bagel game? (Picks up his dropped bagel.) (To Chandler)\nDude, I don\xc2\x92t know. That\xc2\x92s a pretty small hole.'
Monica	 Honey, you gotta talk to her.'
Joey	 I can\xc2\x92t! Y\xc2\x92know? You guys don\xc2\x92t know what it\xc2\x92s like to\nput yourself out there like that and just get shot down.'
Chandler	 (incredulous) I don\xc2\x92t know what that\xc2\x92s like?! Up until I was\n25 I thought the only response to, "I love you," was, "Oh crap!"'
Monica	 Hello? No rejection? I got shot down at fat camp! Boy, kids are mean\nwhen they\xc2\x92re hungry.'
Joey	 All right so, so what do I do?'
Monica	 This is Rachel. I mean, what are you gonna do, never going to talk to\nher again? I mean I know it\xc2\x92s weird, it\xc2\x92s awkward, but you gotta at least try.'
Joey	 Yeah. Okay. (Goes to take a bite out of the previously mentioned bagel.)\nWhoa! (Stops.) I almost forgot this was on your\xc2\x85'
Chandler	 (interrupting him) We didn\xc2\x92t play it!!'

Phoebe	 Okay, so when you\xc2\x92re done with your tea I\xc2\x92ll look at your\nleaves and tell you your fortune.'
Chandler	 I didn\xc2\x92t know you read tea leaves.'
Phoebe	 Oh yeah, I\xc2\x92ve done it for years. I actually stopped because I was\nso accurate. Y\xc2\x92know, and-and y\xc2\x92know, one of the great joys of life is\nit\xc2\x92s-it\xc2\x92s wondrous unpredictability. Y\xc2\x92know? And also tea tends to give me\nthe trots.'
Monica	 Okay, I\xc2\x92m done. Read mine.'
Phoebe	 Okay. (Looks at the leaves.) Ooh, I see a ladder. (Checks the book)\nWhich can mean either a promotion or a violent death.'
Monica	 (stunned) I-I\xc2\x92m the head chef. I-I can\xc2\x92t get promoted.'
Phoebe	 Uh-hmm. Uh-hmm, who\xc2\x92s next?'
Rachel	 Okay, I\xc2\x92m done. Do mine.'
Phoebe	 Okay. (Reads the leaves) Umm, oh! Okay, I see a circle.'
Rachel	 Ah.'
Phoebe	 Oh! (Checking the book) Which can either mean you\xc2\x92re having a baby\nor you\xc2\x92re gonna make a scientific discovery!'
Rachel	 Well, I have been spending a lot of time in the lab.'
Chandler	 What does yours say Pheebs?'
Phoebe	 Umm\xc2\x85 Wow, all right. (Checks the book.) Wow! Yay! Ooh, I\xc2\x92m\ngonna meet a guy! And really soon! And he\xc2\x92s gonna be the man of my dreams. Probably\nnot the guy I had a dream about last night. (Points at Chandler.)'
Ross	 (entering) Hey! Has anyone seen my shirt? It\xc2\x92s a button down, like a,\nlike a faded salmon?'
Monica	 You mean your pink shirt?'
Ross	 Faded salmon color.'
Monica	 No, I-I haven\xc2\x92t seen your pink shirt.'
Ross	 Great! Great. Then I must\xc2\x92ve left it at Mona\xc2\x92s. I knew it!'
Chandler	 Well, I\xc2\x92m sure you get another one at Ann Taylor\xc2\x92s.'
Ross	 That\xc2\x92s my favorite shirt! Okay? I love that shirt!'
Rachel	 Well just ask Mona to give it back!'
Ross	 I don\xc2\x92t know. I mean I-I guess I could. It\xc2\x92s just that we\ndidn\xc2\x92t really end things such good terms. And if I go over there I\xc2\x92d be ignoring\nthe one thing she asked me to do when we broke up, jump up my own ass and die. (Walks\naway.)'
Phoebe	 (noticing a guy sitting by the green post looking at her) Oh wait a\nsecond you guys\xc2\x85for the last couple weeks I\xc2\x92ve been that guy everywhere I go. We\ntake the same bus. We go to the same bookstore, the same dry cleaners; maybe he\xc2\x92s the\ntea guy. (He gets up to leave, and smiles at Phoebe.)'
Chandler	 Phoebe, did you see that?! He totally checked you out! He is so cute!\n(Looking at his tea.) Mine has a picture of The Village People, what does that\nmean?'
Rachel	 Hi!'
Joey	 Hey.'
Rachel	 Hi.'
Joey	 Hi.'
Monica	 Tea gives Phoebe the trots.'
Rachel	 So I thought Joey and I would be okay once we hung out, but it\xc2\x92s\nnot even like we know how to be with each other anymore.'
Chandler	 I know it\xc2\x92s tough now, but things will get better.'
Rachel	 How do you know that? What if it just gets worse and worse and worse, to\nthe point where we can\xc2\x92t even be in the same room with each other?!'
Chandler	 I\xc2\x92m not great at the advice, can I interest you in a sarcastic\ncomment? Some cheese?'
Monica	 Honey, what is the Bruce Springsteen CD in the Kat Stevens case?'
Chandler	 Let\xc2\x92s just say if I can\xc2\x92t find the right CD case I just put\nit in the nearest one.'
Monica	 Okay, where is the Kat Stevens CD?'
Chandler	 In the James Taylor case.'
Monica	 Where is the James Taylor CD?'
Chandler	 Honey, I\xc2\x92m gonna save you some time, 200 CDs, not one of them in\nthe right case.'
Monica	 Okay. No need to panic. Deep breathes everyone. Okay umm uh, we\xc2\x92re\njust gonna have to spend some time and put the CDs in the right cases.'
Chandler	 Well, if we\xc2\x92re gonna do that we should come up with some kind of\norder. Y\xc2\x92know alphabetically or by genre?'
Monica	 Hmm, I don\xc2\x92t know. We really have to talk this through.'
Rachel	 Oh my God!! You guys have such problems!! I feel so terrible for you!'
Monica	 Okay, I-I\xc2\x92m sorry. You and Joey, your both focusing on this\nuncomfortable thing, what you need to do is to change the subject. Next time you see him\ntry to get him talking about something else.'
Rachel	 Oh yeah. That makes sense.'
Monica	 Yeah, like I don\xc2\x92t know, maybe you have a work problem that you\nneed his advice on.'
Rachel	 Ooh, I can do that.'
Monica	 Good. (To Chandler) Uh honey, the Miami Vice soundtrack? Really?'
Chandler	 They were just giving those away at the store (off Monica\xc2\x92s look)\nin exchange for money.'
Joey	 (entering) Hey!'
Rachel	 Hi.'
Monica	 Uh I really don\xc2\x92t know what to tell you Rach, I really don\xc2\x92t.\nI mean, maybe Joey can help you out with your, with your big work problem.'
Rachel	 What?'
Monica	 Yeah Joey she\xc2\x92s\xc2\x85Rachel\xc2\x92s got this really big work\nproblem, and it is a head scratcher. Wow! (To Chandler) Y\xc2\x92know what, if we\xc2\x92re\ngonna make dinner we\xc2\x92re gonna have to leave. Yeah. (She and Chandler exit.)'
Joey	 So you uh, have a\xc2\x85big work problem?'
Rachel	 Yeah it\xc2\x92s umm\xc2\x85 Yeah it\xc2\x92s uh\xc2\x85 It-it\xc2\x92s\ny\xc2\x92know\xc2\x97It\xc2\x92s nothing.'
Joey	 Huh. Okay. (Awkward silence.) So uh, I think I\xc2\x92m gonna take off.'
Rachel	 Yeah\xc2\x97No wait! Joey no wait it is. It\xc2\x92s something.\nIt\xc2\x92s-it\xc2\x92s umm\xc2\x85it\xc2\x92s my boss.'
Joey	 Yeah?'
Rachel	 Yeah, and umm my baby.'
Joey	 Yeah?'
Rachel	 My boss wants to buy my baby!'
Joey	 What?! Oh my-oh my God!'
Rachel	 I know I told you, it\xc2\x92s a really big problem.'
Joey	 What he wants to buy your baby?!'
Rachel	 Can you believe that?!'
Joey	 That\xc2\x92s crazy!'
Rachel	 That\xc2\x92s what I told him!'
Joey	 Okay, how did this even happen?'
Rachel	 Well I\xc2\x92ll tell ya! (Pause) See uh my-my boss and his\nwife\xc2\x97They-they can\xc2\x92t have children. So umm, and that\xc2\x97we were at the\nChristmas party, and he got drunk, and he said to me, "Rachel, I want to buy your\nbaby."'
Joey	 Man! When you said it was a problem about your boss and the baby I figured\nit was something about maternity leave.'
Rachel	 Ohh! Yeah! (Pause) Yeah that-that would\xc2\x92ve been a much simpler\nproblem.'
Phoebe	 Oh hello.'
Guy	 Oh, it\xc2\x92s you. I see you everywhere. I\xc2\x92m Jim, Jim Nelson.'
Phoebe	 Oh Jim, Jim Nelson I\xc2\x92m Phoebe, Phoebe Buffay. We certainly have\nbeen seeing a lot of each other lately. '
Jim	 We have. Maybe we\xc2\x92ll be seeing each other at dinner tomorrow night,\nsay around 8 o\xc2\x92clock?'
Phoebe	 Well, maybe we will. (Starts to walk away.) Oh! (She turns around and\nthe exchange information.)'
Ross	 Mona? (There\xc2\x92s no answer, so he starts to leave but remembers where\nher extra key is. He reaches atop a hall light just outside her door and grabs the key. He\nlooks at in triumph as the pain from it being hot moves along his nervous system to his\nbrain, and when it arrives his brain orders his hand to drop the hot key and his mouth to\nsqueal in pain. After dropping the key he pulls his shirtsleeve over his hand and uses the\nkey to open the door and enter Mona\xc2\x92s apartment.) Okay, if I were a salmon shirt,\nwhere would I be? (He hears a key in the door and as it opens he dives behind the couch.)'
Mona	 (entering, with her date) I am so sorry I spilled wine all over your\nshirt.'
Mona's Date	 Oh, it\xc2\x92s okay."
Mona	 No, it\xc2\x92s still wet. Y\xc2\x92know what? Let me get it out before it\nsets. Ooh, I have something you can wear. Here. (Hands him Ross\xc2\x92s shirt.) '
Mona's Date	 Oh umm, I-I don\xc2\x92t know if I want to wear a woman\xc2\x92s shirt."
Mona	 No-no that\xc2\x92s a man\xc2\x92s shirt.'
Mona\'s Date	 It\xc2\x92s awfully pink. (Ross mouths, "It\xc2\x92s\nsalmon!")'
Chandler	 Oh my God, honey we are so meant to be together. We both have copies\nof the Annie soundtrack.'
Monica	 Honey, both yours.'
Rachel	 (entering) Hey! Great advice on that Joey thing!'
Monica	 Yeah? The work problem?'
Rachel	 Oh it was perfect! I mean it really felt like he was my friend again.'
Chandler	 What problem did you tell him you had?'
Rachel	 Oh that\xc2\x92s not important. The point is, I really\xc2\x97I think\neverything\xc2\x92s gonna be okay.'
Mr. Zelner	 May I help you?'
Joey	 Do you think you can just buy my friends baby?!'

Phoebe	 Isn\xc2\x92t it funny how we kept running into each other? It\xc2\x92s as if\nsomeone really wants us to be together.'
Jim	 Someone does. Me.'
Phoebe	 Oh, witty banter. Well done.'
Jim	 So, tell me a little bit about yourself.'
Phoebe	 Oh okay, well I\xc2\x92m a masseuse, and I used to work at this\nplace\xc2\x85'
Jim	 Do you like to party?'
Phoebe	 I-I-I like, I like parties.'
Jim	 You\xc2\x92re wild, aren\xc2\x92t ya?'
Phoebe	 Yeah I guess, a little.'
Jim	 It ain\xc2\x92t no thing, I\xc2\x92m wild too.'
Phoebe	 (a little freaked out) So! Umm, anyway I-I lived in New York, someone\nwildly I guess, for umm\xc2\x97Well since I was fourteen.'
Jim	 I\xc2\x92m sorry. I\xc2\x92m staring. It\xc2\x92s just that you have the most\nbeautiful eyes.'
Phoebe	 Oh stop it.'
Jim	 And your breasts! Hmm!!!'
Phoebe	 Okay. Umm look, you\xc2\x92re coming on a little strong. But I\xc2\x92m\ngoing to give you the benefit of the doubt, because it seems the universe really wants to\nbe together. So, why don\xc2\x92t we just start over okay? And you can just tell me about\nyourself.'
Jim	 All right.'
Phoebe	 Okay.'
Jim	 I write erotic novels, for children.'
Phoebe	 What?!'
Jim	 They\xc2\x92re wildly unpopular.'
Phoebe	 Oh my God!'
Jim	 Oh also, you might be interested to know that I have a Ph.D.'
Phoebe	 Wow! You do?'
Jim	 Yeah, (looks at his crotch) a Pretty Huge\xc2\x85'
Phoebe	 All right. (Gets up and walks out.)'
Chandler	 (singing) The sun\xc2\x92ll come out\xc2\x85tomorrow! Bet\xc2\x85your\nbottom dollar that tomorrow\xc2\x85 (The girls start laughing, and in a deep voice) \xc2\x85there\xc2\x92ll\nbe sun.'
Joey	 (entering) Hey!'
Rachel	 Hey! Oh Joey, honey listen, thank you for talking to my yesterday about\nthat thing with my boss. That really meant a lot.'
Joey	 Not a problem. Oh, and just so you know, that guy\xc2\x92s not going to be\nbothering you about that baby thing anymore.'
Rachel	 (worried) What?'
Joey	 Let\xc2\x92s just say I took care of it.'
Rachel	 Whoa-whoa-whoa, let\xc2\x92s say more!'
Joey	 Don\xc2\x92t worry! Don\xc2\x92t worry. I just told him, very nicely,\n"You don\xc2\x92t go buying people\xc2\x92s babies, so back off!!"'
Rachel	 What?!'
Chandler and Monica	 What?!'
Rachel	 No! No, no-no-no Joey he doesn\xc2\x92t want to buy my baby! I made that\nup!'
Joey	 What?! Why?!'
Rachel	 So that we would have something to talk about! So it wouldn\xc2\x92t be\nawkward!'
Joey	 And you couldn\xc2\x92t think of anything else?!'
Monica	 You said your boss wants to buy your baby?!'
Rachel	 (To Joey) I can\xc2\x92t believe that you yelled at my boss!\nI\xc2\x92m-I\xc2\x92m gonna lose my job! What am I going to do?!'
Chandler	 You can always sell your baby.'
Rachel	 Oh Joey, I can\xc2\x92t believe you brought my boss into this! I\xc2\x92m\ngonna get fired!'
Joey	 You lied to me!'
Rachel	 Well, she told me too! (Points to Monica and Joey glares at her.)'
Monica	 Chandler has two copies of Annie!'
Mona	 (seeing Ross) Oh my God! Ross!!!'
Ross	 Hello!!'
Mona	 Ross, what are you doing?!'
Ross	 Not touching myself if that makes anyone less uncomfortable.'
Rachel	 Morning. You wanted to see me?'
Mr. Zelner	 Please, come in. Have a seat. (She does so.)'
Rachel	 Okay look Mr. Zelner\xc2\x85'
Mr. Zelner	 Oh I think it\xc2\x92s best that I speak first.'
Rachel	 Yeah. (Motions for him to continue.)'
Mr. Zelner	 I\xc2\x92ve asked Lee from human resources to be here as a witness to\nour conversation.'
Rachel	 Oh God.'
Mr. Zelner	 If I in any way implied that I wanted to buy your baby\xc2\x85I am\nsorry. Okay? Last week when I asked you when your due date was uh, I certainly did not\nmean that I felt that I was due your baby. Yeah, I want to be very clear that I\nunderstand that its your baby, and it is not mine to purchase.'
Rachel	 Well, as long as we are clear about that. (Exits smugly.)'
Phoebe	 Oh there it is.'
Monica	 That\xc2\x92s not your regular dry cleaners.'
Phoebe	 I know, but that creep that I went on that date with goes to there so I\nhave to find a new one. I also have to find a new video store, a new bank, a new adult\nbookstore, a new grocery store\xc2\x85'
Monica	 What?!'
Phoebe	 A new grocery store. The universe said I was going to meet a nice guy\nand that\xc2\x92s what they gave me? (Looks up) When I get up there I\xc2\x92m going to kick\nsome ass.'
Monica	 Don\xc2\x92t worry Phoebe, you\xc2\x92re gonna meet someone. If I can meet a\ngreat guy, so can you.'
Phoebe	 Yeah, we both can. And we both will.'
Phoebe	 Oh, you didn\xc2\x92t have to come in with me.'
Monica	 Are you kidding? This is where they get out stains! Okay? This is like Disneyland\nfor me. I\xc2\x92m-I\xc2\x92m gonna be over here watching the dance of the clean shirts. (She\npoints to and walks over to the electric clothes rack they have.)'
Phoebe	 Okay.'
Guy	 (To Phoebe) Oh, excuse me! I think you dropped s\xc2\x85(looks at Phoebe.)\nWow!'
Phoebe	 What?'
Guy	 I\xc2\x92m sorry, it\xc2\x92s just that you\xc2\x92re so incredibly beautiful.'
Phoebe	 Oh yeah well, I\xc2\x92m sorry about that too, but what are you going to\ndo?'
Guy	 I hope you don\xc2\x92t think I\xc2\x92m crazy but I feel like I was meant to\npick this up, do you believe in that kind of thing?'
Phoebe	 A little. (She turns around and looks up.) (To the universe) Now\nyou\xc2\x92re talking.'
Guy	 Would you like to go out and have a cup of coffee?'
Phoebe	 I-I-I\xc2\x92d love to. Let me just tell my friend.'
Monica	 (to the clerk) Ooh, an ink stain! Hey, can I watch how you get this out?'
Phoebe	 (looking around) She must\xc2\x92ve left.'
Rachel	 Hi.'
Joey	 So? What-what-what happened?'
Rachel	 It\xc2\x92s all gonna be okay. They\xc2\x92re just so happy that I\xc2\x92m\nnot suing them that they gave me one extra month paid maternity leave. So long as I\nunderstand that the money should not construed as a down payment on this or any other\nchild I should bear.'
Chandler	 Wow, Ralph Lauren is really going out of there way to show\nthey\xc2\x92re not in the baby buying business.'
Rachel	 Chandler, can you give us a minute?'
Chandler	 Oh I\xc2\x92m sorry, you\xc2\x92re kicking me out of my own living room?'
Rachel	 Yeah.'
Chandler	 I\xc2\x92ll be in there. (Goes into the bedroom.)'
Rachel	 Joey, I\xc2\x92m really sorry that I lied to you. I was just trying to\nmake things\xc2\x85'
Joey	 I know. I know.'
Rachel	 It kinda worked. I mean y\xc2\x92know, I don\xc2\x92t know about you buy I\nhaven\xc2\x92t thought about our thing since all this.'
Joey	 Hey you\xc2\x92re right. Yeah, it\xc2\x92s kinda been like us again a little\nbit.'
Rachel	 Yeah I know! I miss that.'
Joey	 Me too. I mean I\xc2\x85haven\xc2\x92t thought at all about how I put myself\nout there and said all that stuff and how you didn\xc2\x92t feel the same way about me\nand-and how it was really awkward.'
Rachel	 My gynecologist tried to kill me.'

Ross	 (on phone) Item J437-A, color
Mona	 (interrupting him) Listen Ross, you don\xc2\x92t have to apologize. I\nunderstand why you were there.'
Ross	 You do?'
Mona	 Yeah, you still have feelings for me. And-and to be honest, I-I still have\nfeelings for you. And I wish that we can work it out Ross, but we can\xc2\x92t. It\xc2\x92s\ntoo complicated with you and Rachel and the baby, I-I just\xc2\x85 It just wasn\xc2\x92t meant\nto be.'
Ross	 (faking starting to cry) Oh God you\xc2\x92re right.'
Mona	 Ross, we\xc2\x85we have to be strong. Okay, I-I\xc2\x92m gonna go. (She picks\nup the shirt Ross has just set down.) Can I? To remember you?'
Ross	 (laughs) No. (Takes the shirt back.)'
