Rachel	 (running in from her bedroom, wearing only a towel) Okay. Hey. Umm. Does\neverybody hate these shoes? '
Chandler	 Oh yeah, but don't worry. I don't think anybody's gonna focus on that\nas long as your wearing that towel dress. "
Rachel	 (to Ross) Tell him. '
Ross	 (to Chandler) It's her first day at this new job. Your not supposed to\nstart with her! "
Chandler	 All right, I suppose I can wait a day. Hey, what are you doing Friday?\n'
Ross	 Why? '
Chandler	 I need you to come to this bachelor party for my weird cousin Albert,\ny'know he's the botanist. "
Ross	 Oh God. Y'know, botanists are such geeks. "
Chandler	 Yeah. Is that a dinosaur tie? '
Ross	 Hmm? Oh, yeah. (he makes a growling sound) '
Phoebe	 (entering, with about 20 purses hanging around her neck) Morning. Rach,\nI'm here with the purses! "
Chandler	 (to Phoebe) It must take you forever to find your keys. '
Rachel	 (running into the living room) Thank you, thank you, thank you, Pheebs. '
Phoebe	 Your welcome, oh please not the one with the turtles. '
Rachel	 No, no, no, no turtles scare me. I don't need that today. "
Ross	 Honey, just relax, it's gonna be fine. Hey, umm,. why don't I come down\nthere and I'll take you out to lunch? "
Rachel	 Oh honey, thank you, but Mark's taking me out. "
Ross	 Mark is that ah, the same Mark that helped you get the job? '
Rachel	 Yeah, it's kinda like a 'good luck on your first day' sort of thing. (to\nPhoebe) Is this actually a lunchbox? "
Phoebe	 Umm, no, it's a purse. And there's a thermos in it. "
Rachel	 Oh. '
Chandler	 (to Ross) Hey, so can you make it on Friday? '
Ross	 What? Oh yeah, yeah I think so. Why am I invited to this again? '
Chandler	 Well apparently Albert has no friends. He's very excited about the\nbachelor party though. I think actually the only reason he's getting married is so he can\nsee a stripper. "
Phoebe	 A stripper at a bachelor party, that is so clich\xc3\xa9. Why don't you get a\nmagician?! "
Chandler	 Well, if the magician can open my beer with his but cheeks, then all\nright. '

Ross	 She's having lunch with him. She's having lunch with him. And you should\nof seen the hug she gave him when she got the job. And, and, and, (to Joey) he's really\ngood looking. (Joey gives an enthusiastic thumbs up) What am I gonna do? "
Chandler	 Don't do anything. Keep it inside. Learn how to hide your feelings!\n(pause) Don't cry outloud. "
Joey	 (hanging up the phone) Yes! Guess who's in an audition for a Broadway\nmusical? "
Chandler	 I want to say you but, that seems like such an easy answer. '
Joey	 It is me! It's a musical version of Tale of Two Cities. So I think\nI'm gonna sing New York, New York, and ah, oh I left My Heart in San Francisco.\n"
Ross	 Ah Joey, I don't think you get to pick the cities. "
Joey	 What? '
Ross	 Mr. Dickens gets to pick 'em. "
Joey	 Who? '
Chandler	 I'll get you the Cliff Notes. "
Joey	 The what? '
Chandler	 The abridgment. '
Joey	 Oh, okay. (to Ross) The what? '
Mark	 ...and the style number, and the invoice number, and the shipping date.\nGood. Any questions so far? '
Rachel	 Yeah. What kind of discount do we get? '
Mark	 Twenty percent. '
Rachel	 Oh!! I love this job! (her phone rings) Wow! My first call. '
Mark	 Here, let me. (answers phone) Rachel Green's line, how may I help you? "
Ross	 (on phone) Hi, is Rachel there? '
Mark	 And who may I say is calling? '
Ross	 This is Ross? '
Mark	 Ross of..... '
Ross	 Of Ross and Rachel. '
Mark	 Oh hi. It's, it's Mark. "
Ross	 Oh hey, hey Mark. '
Mark	 Hey, hold on a second. '
Ross	 Okay. '
Rachel	 Hi honey! '
Ross	 Hi! What's ah, what's Mark doing answering your phone? "
Rachel	 Oh, he's just goofing around. "
Ross	 Ohhhhh yeah, that's, that's funny. Why ah, why isn't he goofing around in\nhis own office? "
Rachel	 Oh honey, this is his office too. I told you we're Joanna's two\nassistants. "
Ross	 Why does Joanna need two assistants, how, how lazy is she? '
Rachel	 Oh! Oh my God! What did I just do? '
Ross	 What? '
Rachel	 I think I just shipped 3,000 bras to personnel. Oh honey, I gotta go.\n(to Mark) Mark, I need you! '
Ross	 Okay, bye-bye. (starts slamming the receiver down in anger.) '
Rachel	 Ow! Ross!! '
Ross	 Oh, oh, I'm, I'm, I'm sorry sweetie, I was just trying to ah, I'm dialing\nanother number. (hangs up) "
Jeannine	 (to Monica) All right, I just got changed in thirty seconds so you can\nbe alone with him. You'd better go for it. "
Monica	 Please, I'm not going for anything. "
Jeannine	 Well, if you don't, I will. "
Monica	 Would you please go? '
Jeannine	 Night Mon. Night Julio. '
Julio	 (to Jeannine) Adios. '
Monica	 Look Julio, someone left their book here. '
Julio	 Ah actually, that is mine. '
Monica	 Oh yeah, what are you reading? '
Julio	 Flowers of Evil, by Beaudalire. Have you read it? '
Monica	 Have I read it? (pause) No, are you enjoying it? '
Julio	 I thought I would, but the translation's no good. "
Monica	 Your a poet and don't know it. (she turns away and makes a face like 'I\ncan't believe I just said that.') "
Julio	 Actually I ah, I am a poet. '
Monica	 Oh, then you do know it. (pause) So um what kind of things do you write\nabout? '
Julio	 Things that move me. The, the shadow of a tree, a child laughing, or this\nlip. (points to her lip) '
Monica	 Mine? (points to her lower lip) Right here? '
Julio	 I can write an epic poem about this lip. (grabs her lower lip) '
Monica	 How would that go? (they kiss) Well, it didn't rhyme, but I liked it. "
Joey	 (singing) You've got to pick a pocket or two. Boyyyyssss, (picks a\nhandkerchief from the pianist's pocket) you've got to pick a pocket or two.......... "
Director	 Lovely, just lovely. '
Joey	 Really? Thanks. '
Director	 Listen Joey, we definitely want to see you for the callback on\nSaturday. '
Joey	 Excellent, I'll be there. "
Director	 Okay, and listen don't forget to bring your jazz shoes for the dance\naudition. "
Joey	 Ahhh! My ah, my agent said it wasn't a dancing part. "
Director	 Joey, all the roles got to dance a little. But believe me with your\ndance background it'll be a piece of cake. "
Chandler	 ....three years of modern dance with Twila Tharp! Five years with the\nAmerican Ballet Theater?! '
Joey	 Hey, everybody lies on their resume, okay. I wasn't one of the Zoom Kids\neither. "
Phoebe	 Well, can you dance at all? '
Joey	 Yeah, I can dance, y'know. (starts to dance really, really, really badly) "
Chandler	 Oh no, no, no, no. '
Phoebe	 (covering her mouth in shock) What, what is that? '
Joey	 Sure, it looks stupid now, there's no music playing. "
Chandler	 All right, I have to get that, but no-no. (answering phone) Hello?\n(listens) (happily) Hi! Yeah listen, I'm, I'm in need of a stripper and I was told that\nyou do that. (listens) Let me ask you this, what, what do you do for the extra hundred?\n(listens) So would I, would I have to provide the grapes? "
Monica	 (entering) Hi! '
Phoebe	 Oh, how was last night with Julio, senorita? '
Monica	 It was soo amazing, he is so sexy, and smart, which makes him even\nsexier. Oh gosh, I gotta so you this. Last night, we were fooling around and he stops to\nwrite a poem. '
Joey	 Get out! I couldn't stop if a meteor hit me. "
Chandler	 Okay, we have our stripper. A miss Crystal Chandelier. '
Joey	 Well sure, you name a kid that, what do you expect them to grow up to be? '
Monica	 Anyway um, when he left he forgot to take the poem with him. Now, I am\nlike totally dense about poetry, but I think it's pretty good all right. Check it out.\n(hands them the poem) "
Joey	 (reading) The Empty Vase. Translucent beauty... '
Chandler	 To yourself. (finishing) Hey-hey-hey, y'know what that's pretty good. "
Monica	 Oh good, I think so too. Pheebs? '
Phoebe	 Oh yeah. '
Monica	 Oh, I'm so glad you guys like it. Yay! All right I gotta go to work.\n(tries to take the poem) "
Joey	 Whoa, I'm not done. "
Monica	 All right, just give it back to me when your done. See you guys. '
Chandler	 Bye-bye. '
Phoebe	 Oh my God, oh my God! Poor Monica! '
Chandler	 What, what, what?! '
Phoebe	 What?! He was with her when he wrote this poem. Look, (reading) 'My\nvessel so empty with nothing inside. Now that I've touched you, you seem emptier still.'\nHe thinks Monica is empty, she is the empty vase! "
Chandler	 You really think that is what he meant? '
Phoebe	 Oh, totally. Oh, God, oh, she seemed so happy too. '
Joey	 Done. '
Mark	 (reaching through the flowers) Do you have the, the Ralph Lauren file? '
Rachel	 Oh, yeah, sure, it's umm... (she picks up this bug and it starts to play\nthe theme from Love Story) "
Mark	 Wh-what's that? "
Ross	 It's from Ross, it's a love bug. "
Mark	 Wow! Somebody wants people to know you have a boyfriend. '
Rachel	 Oh no, no-no-no, that's not, not, not, what he is doing. He's just, he's\njust really romantic. "
Man	 (to Rachel) Ah, excuse me, are you Rachel Green? '
Rachel	 Yes. '
Man	 (being joined by the rest of the barbershop quartet) One, two, three... '
Quartet	 (singing) Congratulations on your first week at your brand new job! It\nwon't be long before your the boss. "
The Bass Barber	 Omm-pah, omm-pah, omm-pah. '
Quartet	 (singing) And you know who will be there to support... you?! Your one\nand only boyfriend... '
The Bass Barber	 It's nice to have a boyfriend. "
Quartet	 Your loyal loving boyfriend Ross..... Ross! '

Ross	 I'm hurt! I'm actually hurt, that you would think that I would send you\nany of those things out of any thing other than love. Hurt! Hurt! "
Rachel	 All right Ross!! I get it!! '
Ross	 I mean my God... '
Rachel	 You're hurt! "
Ross	 ...can't, can't a guy send a barbershop quartet to his girlfriend's office\nanymorrrrre!! "
Rachel	 Oh, please, Ross it was so obvious! It was like you were marking your\nterritory. I mean you might have well have just come in and peed all around my desk! '
Ross	 I would never do that! '
Rachel	 Look, I know what's going on here, okay, Mark explained it all to me. He\nsaid this is what you guys do. "
Ross	 Yeah well if, if, if Mark said that, than Mark's an idiot. "
Joey	 Mark's a genius! "
Ross	 Why?! How?! How is he a genius? '
Chandler	 Look, don't you see what's happening here. Instead of hitting on her\nright away, he's becoming her confidant. Now he's gonna be the guy she goes too to\ncomplain about you. "
Ross	 What am I going to do? '
Chandler	 Well, why don't you send her a musical bug, op, no you already did\nthat. All right look, you're going to have to go there yourself now, okay, make a few\nsurprise visits. "
Ross	 I don't know you guys. "
Chandler	 All right fine, don't do anything, just sit here and talk to us,\nmeanwhile she is talking to him about you. And he's being Mr. Joe Sensitive, and she\nstarts thinking 'Maybe this is the guy for me, because he understands me.' "
Joey	 And before you know it, she's with him. And you'll be all, 'Ohh, man!' And\nhe'll be all, 'Yes!' And us, we'll be like, 'Wh-whoa, dude.' And pretty soon you'll be\nlike, (sadly) 'Hhiii,' and, and, and, 'I can't go, Rachel and Mark might be there.' And\nwe'll be like, 'Man get over it, it's been four years!!' "
Chandler	 He paints quite a picture doesn't he? "
Woman	 (walking up to Mark) Here's the Shelly Siegal stuff from December. "
Mark	 (turning around) And wait, I've got something for you. (kisses her) "
Woman	 Mark!! '
Mark	 It's okay, Rachel knows. "
Woman	 Yeah, but even soo. '
Mark	 I can't help it, I'm just, I'm just crazy about you. "
Rachel	 Ohhh! That is soo sweet! (gets up to get herself a cup of coffee) '
Mark	 Okay, okay look, I know I'm being Mr. Inappropriate today, but it's just\nso tough, I mean see you walking around and I just wanna touch you and hold you, come on\nno one's around, just, just kiss me. "
Ross	 All right that's, that's it!! Get off her! "
Mark	 What is going on? '
Ross	 What's going on?! (throws the love bug at him) That's what's going on!! "
Rachel	 (now standing behind Ross) Ross! '
Ross	 I have been down in your store for twenty minutes trying to get a tie!\nWhat do I have to do to get some service?! (turns to Rachel) Hi Rach. (He's puts his hand\non her shoulder and she knocks it away.) "
Director	 Ah Joey. Joey Tribbiani. Listen Joey, I got a problem, I just got a\ncall from my dance captain, he's having a relationship crisis and can't get out of Long\nIsland. "
Joey	 So, does that mean the audition is off? '
Director	 Listen Joey, seeing as you've got the most experience, I want you to\ntake these dancers and show them the combination. "
Joey	 What?! '
Director	 Aw come on Joey, it's easy. Y'know, it's hand, hand, head, head, (very\nquickly, Joey watches stunned) up, pas de bouree, pas de bouree, big turn here, grand\nsissone, sissone, sissone, slide back, step, step, step, and jazz hands! "
Joey	 It's ah, step-ity, step and jazz hands. "
Director	 Have fun. '
Joey	 Bye. (does the jazz hands) '
Phoebe	 (entering) Hey! '
Monica	 Hey. '
Phoebe	 What are you wrapping? '
Monica	 Oh-ho, look what I got Julio. '
Phoebe	 Yeah, it's a vase. "
Monica	 Yeah, just like the one in the poem. '
Phoebe	 Well not exactly like the one in the poem. '
Monica	 What do you mean? '
Phoebe	 Remember how you said you were really dense about poetry? Oh. (hugs her)\n'
Monica	 (to Julio) So! I'm just an empty vase, huh? "
Julio	 What? '
Monica	 Y'know, so I don't read as many important books as you do, and I don't\nwrite trick poems that seem to be about one thing but are actually about something else.\nAnd y'know what, I get excited about stupid stuff, like when I my People magazine\ncomes on Saturday, and the new Hold Everything catalog. Y'know but that does not\nmean that I'm empty, I care about things. I care about my friends and family. You have no\nright to make that kind of judgment about me. "
Julio	 Whoa, whoa, whoa. '
Monica	 You don't even know me... "
Julio	 Whoa, whoa, whoa, the poem is not about you. '
Monica	 What? '
Julio	 The Empty Vase is not about you. My baby, you make me so sad that you\nwould think this. '
Monica	 I'm sorry, my friend Phoebe... "
Julio	 No, it's about all women. Well, all American women. You feel better now? "
Monica	 (sarcastically) Oh yeah. '
Director	 All right, let's do it! "
Director	 No, no, no. What was that? '
Joey	 I know, it was the best I could get out of them. '
Director	 Well, people! '
Joey	 People, people, people. '
Director	 Let's try it again, and this time let's watch everybody watch Joey.\n(to Joey) Show 'em how it's done. (to the pianist) Count it off. "
Rachel	 So ah, did you have fun at the bachelor party last night? '
Chandler	 Oh yeah, yeah! Look what I got, look what I got. (holds up a pen) See,\nshe's fully dressed, right? "
Rachel	 Right. '
Chandler	 And then you click it and, uh-oh, she's naked. And then, and then you\nclick it again and she's dressed. She's a business woman, she's walking down the street,\nshe's window shopping, and (clicks pen) whoa-whoa-whoa, sh-she's naked! (Rachel just\nstares at him.) "
Ross	 (entering) Hi. '
Rachel	 Hello. '
Chandler	 Y'know what, I'm, I'm gonna spend some alone time with the pen. "
Ross	 (sits down next to her) I'm sorry, I was an idiot. "
Rachel	 A big idiot. '
Ross	 A big idiot. Just you have to realize is, this whole Mark thing is kinda\nhard for me. '
Rachel	 Honey, why is it hard, I mean we've been together for almost a year now?\n"
Ross	 Well, I was with Carol for like eight years and I lost her. And now if\nit's possible I think I love you even more. So, it's hard for me to believe that I'm not\ngonna, well that someone else is not going to take you away. "
Gunther	 Let it be me! Let it be me! '
Rachel	 Honey, that's very sweet, it just seems to me though, that if two people\nlove each other and trust each other, like we do, there's no reason to be jealous. (she\nkisses him) "
Ross	 I gotta get going. Bye Chandler. '
Chandler	 Oh, okay Ross. Listen, this pen is kinda getting boring, so can you\npick me up some porn? '
Rachel	 Where ya going? '
Ross	 Oh, I've got to go pick up Ben, we've got a play date this afternoon. "
Rachel	 Ohh, with who? '
Ross	 Oh, just this woman that I met last night at the party. '
Rachel	 There was a woman at the... (realizes) The stripper?! '
Ross	 Yeah. '
Rachel	 You have a play date with a stripper?! '
Chandler	 Man, I gotta get a kid. (looks at the pen and starts laughing) '
Ross	 Ah, yeah, yeah. Umm, we started talking after she y'know, did her thing.\nAnd it turns out she's got a boy about Ben's age, so we're taking them to a gym-boree\nclass. Why, is that okay? "
Rachel	 Sure, is she married? '
Ross	 Ahh, no. '
Rachel	 Oh. (starts shaking the sugar down in a packet really hard.) '
Ross	 Are you jealous? '
Rachel	 Noo, I y'know I don't see why she has to play with you, that's all. I\nmean doesn't she have any y'know other stripper moms friends of her own? "
Ross	 You are totally jealous. '
Rachel	 I'm not jealous. All right this is about, umm, people feeling certain\nthings y'know about strippers. And y'know, and um, I... "
Ross	 Honey, I love you too. '
Rachel	 Ugh. Wait, wait, wait. '
Ross	 What? '
Ross	 Huh. '
Rachel	 (to Chandler) Well, there's a kiss that he won't forget for a couple of\nhours, y'know. "
Chandler	 Yeah. Either that, or you just turned him on and sent him off to a\nstripper. '

Man	 (entering) Is there a Julio here? '
Julio	 (to him) I am Julio. '
Man	 (singing) Mister Pretensous, (Monica stands up in the background) you think\nthere's no one finer, well but your poems are unpublished, and you work in a diner. "
Quartet	 Your no God's gift to women, that's all in your headdddd. You are just\na buttmunch. "
Bass Singer	 No one likes a buttmunch. '
Quartet	 And your also bad in bedd-edd-edd!. '
