Rachel	 Come on Joey!!!'
Joey	 Rach, I told you everything I knew last night! Look, it's not that big of a deal,\nso Monica and Chandler are doing it."
Rachel	 I can't believe you would say that!"
Joey	 Sorry. Monica and Chandler are making love.'
Rachel	 No! I mean come on! This is a huge deal! (She sits next to him on the\ncouch.) Fine I want\xc2\x97I need more details, who-who initiated the first kiss?'
Joey	 (thinks) I don't know."
Rachel	 Is he romantic with her?'
Joey	 I don't know."
Rachel	 Are they in love?'
Joey	 (thinks) I don't know."
Rachel	 You don't know anything."
Joey	 Ohh, I know one thing!'
Rachel	 What?'
Joey	 They did it right there on the couch. '

Joey	 Hey Ross!'
Phoebe	 Hey!'
Ross	 (disinterested) Hey-yeah. (He hurries up to the counter.) Hey Gunther, can I have\na scone please? (To the gang.) Wanna hear some good news? Someone I know is getting\nmarried! Yeah! And weddings are happy occasions! Oh, by-the-by it's my ex-wife Emily!"
All	  What? Oh!'
Chandler	 Sorry man.'
Gunther	 Here's your scone."
Ross	 Oh, thanks Gunther. (He takes it, hands the plate it's on to Rachel, sets it down\non the table, and proceeds to pound it into oblivion while saying.) STUPID BRITISH SNACK\nFOOD!!!!!!!"
Chandler	 Did they teach you that in your anger management class?'
Phoebe	 Hey, you know what might help you deal with it? Think of it this way, you and\nEmily are in the past and you can't be mad about the past. So are you still mad about the\nLouisiana Purchase?"
Rachel	 Pheebs, I don\xc2\x92t think anyone's mad about that."
Phoebe	 Exactly! Because it's in the past!"
Joey	 (eyeing the flattened scone) Anybody gonna eat that?'
Monica	 Look at us all dressed up for the big office party! By the way, what are we\ncelebrating?'
Chandler	 Oh, we had a lot of liquor left over from the Christmas party.'
Monica	 I think this is so cool because none of our friends are here and we can be a\nreal couple. We don't have to hide."
Chandler	 I know, I can do this. (He takes her hand.)'
Monica	 Ooh, and I can do this. (She kisses him on the cheek.)'
Doug	 Hey Bing! (Slaps him on his ass.) (Sees Monica) Wo-ho-ho, who's the pretty lady\nand what the hell is she doing with you?"
Chandler	 I asked myself that very question, sir. Uh, (Points to Monica) this is\nMonica. (Points to his boss.) This is my boss, Doug. Doug this is Monica.'
Monica	 Hi, nice to meet you!'
Doug	 Hi! And this is my wife Kara.'
Kara	 Nice to meet you Monica. Bing! (Slaps Chandler on his butt.)'
Doug	 Say uh, Bing, did you hear about the new law firm we got working for us?'
Chandler	 No, sir.'
Doug	 Yeah, Dewey, Cheatum, and Howe.'
Doug	 Come on honey, let's go drink our body weight. (They walk off leaving Chandler\nand Monica alone.)"
Monica	 What was that?'
Chandler	 What?'
Monica	 That noise you just made?'
Chandler	 Oh, that was my work laugh.'
Monica	 Really? Your work laugh?'
Chandler	 Oh, believe me, to survive this party, you're gonna have to come up with one\ntoo."
Monica	 All right, check me out.'
Chandler	 Okay.'
Doug	 \xc2\x85says $30 Father; same as in town.'
Chandler	 Hey! Everybody at work loved you last night! '
Monica	 Really?'
Chandler	 And! They like me more just because I was with ya! I think you\nrepaired a lot of the damage from when they met Joey. And Doug wants us to play tennis\nwith them. He's never even talked to me outside of work. Except for that time when\nwe bumped into each other at that strip club. (She glares at him.) Strip church. Anyway,\nI'm gonna go try and find a racquet."
Monica	 Hey, I thought you already had one.'
Chandler	 Oh I used too, but then Joey thought it would be fun to go to Central Park\nand hit rocks at\xc2\x85bigger rocks. (He starts to leave and stops an entering Rachel.) Hey\nRach, do you have a tennis racquet?'
Rachel	 Oh umm, y'know I lent it to Joey and I never actually got it back."
Chandler	 Okay, good luck with that. (Exits.)'
Rachel	 (To Monica) Hey!'
Monica	 Hi!'
Rachel	 What's up?!"
Monica	 What are you doing here? I thought you had to do inventory all day.'
Rachel	 Well yeah, I do, but I decided to take a long lunch and spend some time with my\nfriend Monica. Y'know I-I feel that we don't talk anymore. How are you? What is new with\nyou?"
Monica	 Uhh, not much. Uh, work's good."
Rachel	 Oh y'know what, we don\xc2\x92t have to talk about work. We can talk about\nanything!"
Monica	 Okay. Umm\xc2\x85'
Rachel	 Hey! Y'know what? Let's talk about relationships!"
Monica	 Okay, what's going on with you?"
Rachel	 Nothing! You go!'
Monica	 Well, I-I\xc2\x97there was this guy at the bank that I thought was cute umm, but\nI don't anymore."
Rachel	 Wow that's uh, juicy. Umm, (checks watch) y'know what though Mon, I actually do\nhave a lot of work to do so if-if\xc2\x97are you sure there's just not anything else?"
Monica	 Yes, I'm sure! Rachel is there something that you want to talk me about?"
Rachel	 No! (Gets up to leave.) (Under her breath.) If there was I wouldn't tell you."
Phoebe	 Okay, then what happened?'
Phoebe	 (gasps) Ohh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. (The chick clucks.) You'll get your turn!"
Ross	 (entering from the bathroom) Hey Pheebs, what's going on?"
Phoebe	 Nothing! (Picks up and sets the chick down on the floor.) (To the chick.) This\nis not over!'
Ross	 No! No! No!'
Phoebe	 What?!'
Ross	 I was up all night writing this really nasty letter to Emily! It was perfect and\nnow it's all covered in-in\xc2\x85 (The duck quacks.) Actually, thanks!"
Joey	 (entering from his room) All right! Everybody ready to go to the movies?'
Ross	 Uh actually, I think I'm gonna skip it."
Joey	 Really?'
Ross	 Yeah, I'm gonna stay and read my book. I just wanna be alone right now."
Joey	 Oh. Are you sure you don't want to come? Tom Hanks, Meg Ryan, they get mail and\nstuff."
Ross	 That's okay, Joe."
Joey	 All right, let's go Pheebs."
Ross	 (licks the envelope and encounters a foreign substance on the glue.) Oh God!'
Doug	 Bing! '
Kara	 Oww!!'
Monica	 Game!'
Doug	 Well, I gotta tell ya Bing; that partner of yours is a real tiger. (To his wife.)\nAre you all right sweethart?'
Kara	 (out of breath and mouths) I'm not all right."
Doug	 We're, we're just gonna get a little sip of water."
Monica	 Am I on fire today or what?! Those birds are browned, basted, and ready to be\ncarved!'
Chandler	 Okay, easy Martina. I think we should let them win the next game.'
Monica	 I'm sorry, I don't understand what you just said."
Chandler	 Let them win one.'
Monica	 Are you crazy?! We own those two! I mean look at 'um, he can't breath and she's\npopping pills."
Chandler	 You're not even giving them a chance!"
Monica	 They have racquets don't they?!"
Doug	 Uh Bing, I think we're gonna make this the last game."
Chandler	 Oh yes, sir! Put me out of my misery. Are you sure you never played pro?\n(Does his work laugh.) (To Monica) Please let them win!'
Monica	 I'll take it down to 95% but that's the best I can do."
Chandler	 Oopsey, missed it!'
Monica	 I got it! (She hits a forehand smash that bounces right in between Doug and\nKara and scores a point.)'
Doug	 Nice shot.'
Monica	 I got it!!'
Chandler	 Long! (Gives Monica the Work Laugh.)'
Monica	 I can't believe you let them win!"
Chandler	 Yeah, at least you hid your feelings well about it. (Removes a smashed\nracquet from his bag.)'
Monica	 I was frustrated.'
Chandler	 It was my racquet.'
Monica	 I was frustrated with you!'
Chandler	 If we hadn't lost the game they never would've invented us to dinner tomorrow\nnight."
Monica	 Y\'know what really bothers me? Is\xc2\x97it\'s how-how different you act around\nthem! I mean y\'know the throwing the tennis games, the fake laugh, the "I\'ll see you\naround, Bing!" "Not if I see you first, Doug!" (Mocks the fake laugh.) I\ngotta tell you, I don\'t like Work Chandler. Okay? The guy\'s a suck-up.'
Chandler	 Okay y'know what, because you said that, I'm not putting out tonight."
Monica	 I'm telling you, something's wrong! My brother does not stay out all night."
Joey	 Maybe we should check the trash chute.'
Rachel	 Ross couldn't fit down the trash chute."
Joey	 That's right, he almost could. Which is exactly how I got stuck there."
Phoebe	 Hey!'
Rachel	 There he is!'
Monica	 Oh my God! (She goes to hug him, stops short, and hits him on the shoulder.)\nWhere the hell have you been?!!'
Ross	 Just, y'know out."
Rachel	 Ohh, out, oh God, I don't know why we didn't think to check there!"
Phoebe	 What were you doing?'
Ross	 I uh, went to a bar. And then I just uh, just walked around for a while.'
Rachel	 You walked around all night in the city by yourself?'
Joey	 (snaps his fingers) He hooked up! He hooked up with someone.'
Ross	 Look, I don't have to answer your questions! Okay? I'm a big boy, I can do\nwhatever I want!"
Joey	 He hooked up!! Tell us about her!'
Janice	 (entering) Ross you left you scarf in\xc2\x85(sees everyone.) Hey you guys. (Does\nthe laugh.)'

Janice	 Uh-oh-okay. Uh-oh-okay. I know what you all are thinking. But Chandler is in Yemen!\nI'm a young woman! I have needs! I can't wait forever!"
Rachel	 Yeah! No that's what I was thinking."
Janice	 So I'm asking you please, take a moment before you judge me."
Phoebe	 Oh, nobody's judging you. (They all turn and look at Ross.)"
Janice	 Oh! Okay! (To Ross) You, Mister Right Place at the Right Time, call me! (Does\nher famous, or is that infamous, laugh and exits.)'
Ross	 Okay, look, I-I know what you guys are going to say\xc2\x85'
Phoebe	 You two will have very hairy children.'
Ross	 Okay, I didn't know you would say that."
Rachel	 Ross! Janice?!'
Joey	 All right, hold on! Hold on. Hold on. This is Ross, okay? He's our friend. He\nobviously went crazy. He obviously lost his mind."
Ross	 Look, I didn't lose my mind! Okay, Janice and I have a lot in common!\nWe've-we've both been divorced. We-we both have kids."
Phoebe	 So are you actually gonna see her again?'
Joey	 Phoebe! Don't put ideas in his head!"
Ross	 I am gonna see her again.'
Joey	 Damnit Phoebe!!'
Rachel	 (entering) Okay, I have to tell you something that I have never admitted during\nour entire friendship! But, when we were in high school I made out with James Farrell even\nwhen I knew that you liked him! Wow, that feels so good to get off my chest! Okay, you go!'
Monica	 My turn? What-what are you talking about?'
Rachel	 Ugh, Monica, I know about you and Chandler.'
Monica	 What?!'
Rachel	 I overheard you guys on the phone the other day, and you said, "I\'ll just\ntell Rachel that I\'m doing laundry for a couple of hours." And he said,\n"Laundry? Is that my new nickname?" And you said, "No! You know what\nyour nickname is, Mr. Big."'
Monica	 Well. Sounds like you're writing yourself a little play there Rach. Wow! Let me\nknow how that one turns out."
Rachel	 Well, I wouldn't know because I got so freaked out that I hung up the phone."
Monica	 Well, if you had kept listening, you-you would have heard me call him Mr.\nBig\xc2\x85(Thinks)\xc2\x85ot.'
Rachel	 What?!'
Monica	 Mr. Bigot. He tells the most racist jokes.'
Rachel	 All right. So you're telling me that there is nothing going on between you and\nChandler."
Monica	 Me and Chandler?! (Does her fake laugh.)'
Joey	 All right, put your 20 bucks down. First one to find the tasty treat wins. Okay?'
Phoebe	 Uh-hmm.'
Joey	 All right. Let's get the contestants out of their isolation booths. (He removes\nthe waste bucket that's over the duck and the laundry basket that's over the chicken.) And\nthey're off! (He puts his foot in front of the chick, stopping it from moving.)"
Phoebe	 Get your foot off my contestant! Judge!'
Joey	 Judge rules, no violation.'
Phoebe	 Ohhh.'
Ross	 (entering) Hey guys!'
Phoebe	 Hey!'
Joey	 Yeah!'
Ross	 Y'know what? It sounds so weird to say this but, I just had a great day with\nJanice! "
Joey	 What?!'
Phoebe	 Are you serious?!'
Ross	 Yeah! I opened up to her about all the terrible stuff that's been happening to\nme. I mean I talked for hours. (Joey has lost interest and is watching the race again.) It\nis amazing to have someone give you such-such focused attention."
Phoebe	 You don't need Janice for that, you've got us. We\xc2\x85"
Joey	 And the duck gets the Nutter-Butter!'
Phoebe	 (turning from Ross.) No!! Hey-hey that's not a Nutter-Butter, that's just an\nold Wonton!"
Joey	 Judge rules, Nutter-Butter.'
Phoebe	 Ohh, tough call.'
Joey	 Yeah.'
Doug	 But seriously, I believe that we should all support President Clinton. And her\nhusband Bill. (Chandler does the laugh.)'
Kara	 So how do you kids like your coffee?'
Monica	 Oh, none for me. Thanks.'
Chandler	 Just a little bit of sugar.'
Doug	 Well, maybe I'll bring it out and have Monica stick her finger in it. That oughta\nsweeten it up, huh? (Once again, with the laugh.)"
Monica	 (To Chandler) How does that laugh not give you a headache?'
Chandler	 Oh, you get used to it.'
Monica	 Y'know, I-I-I don't think that I can. So if you don't mind, maybe this will be\nit for me on the work things."
Chandler	 So I laugh at my boss's jokes, what's the big deal?"
Monica	 I'd rather hang out with a sniveling work weasel guy when I can be hanging out\nwith my boyfriend who I actually respect."
Chandler	 Oh. (Does a double take when he realizes what she just said.)'
Doug	 (entering) Uh, I gotta apologize for Kara's coffee. Y'know, I feel sorry for it\nif it ever got in a fight, it's not strong enough to defend itself. (Chandler does not\nlaugh.) Did you hear what I said Bing?"
Chandler	 What?'
Doug	 The joke Bing. What's the matter with you?"
Chandler	 Well, I-I just didn't think it was funny sir."
Doug	 Excuse me?'
Chandler	 Well, I just\xc2\x85'
Monica	 (interrupting) Honey, I just don't think that you understood the joke."
Chandler	 Really?'
Monica	 Yeah! I mean it was really funny, I-I just don't think you got it. You see\nKara's coffee is-is-is weak tasting, okay? But-but what Doug was-was imply that it was\nweak physically. You get it now honey?"
Chandler	 I think I do! (They all laugh.) Thank you, Monica.'
Monica	 I thought you could use the help.'
Chandler	 Coffee in a fight! (Does the laugh again.)'
Joey	 (entering) Hey Rach! Hey, you mind if I read my comic books in here?'
Rachel	 Sure! Why?'
Joey	 Oh well, Chandler and Monica are over there and it's kinda hard to concentrate."
Rachel	 What?! She just called and said that she was gonna be working late! She keeps\nlying to me! That's it! Y'know what? I'm just gonna go over there and confront them right\nnow!"
Chandler	 (from his bedroom) All right, so you're telling me that I have to tell racist\njokes now?!"
Monica	 Sorry! I'm just\xc2\x97I'm not very good at this! I'm a terrible liar and I hate\nhaving to lie to Rachel!"
Chandler	 But we're not ready to tell yet!"
Monica	 I know! It's just that\xc2\x85ever since high school Rachel was the one person I\ntold everything too. Y'know? I miss that so much now. She's my best friend."
Monica	 (entering) Joey?! Oh my God, Rachel!'
Rachel	 Hey! Hi!'
Monica	 Wh-wh-what are you doing here? (She tries to pull her shirt down to cover the\nfact that she's wearing men's boxers.]"
Rachel	 Well, I was actually\xc2\x97I-I came over here to-to borrow this lamp. To umm,\nlook at my books, y'know, see them a little better."
Monica	 Okay great! '
Rachel	 Yeah!'
Monica	 Great! Umm, well what-what I was doing in Chandler's room is that umm, I was\ncleaning it! In fact, he pays me to clean it!"
Rachel	 Oh! What a great way to earn some extra pocket money.'
Monica	 Y'know when I said to you earlier that I was at work umm, I'm at my new work."
Rachel	 That's good enough. Right? (Pause.) Okay, well umm, I'm gonna go look at my\nbooks!"
Monica	 Okay.'
Rachel	 Okay.'
Monica	 I'll get back to my new job."
Rachel	 'Kay. (Pause.) Congratulations on your new job. (She goes and hugs Monica and\nis almost in tears.)"
Chandler	 Man, she is really gullible.'
Gunther	 Here you go. (Serves them both some coffee.)'
Ross	 Thanks!'
Janice	 Actually, I should get going.'
Ross	 Are you sure? Because I can stay out as late as you want. I told you how I'm on\nsabbatical from work, right?"
Janice	 Yes! Yes! You did!'
Ross	 Oh\xc2\x85'
Janice	 What is wrong now?!'
Ross	 This isn't what I ordered! Man! Can anything go right in my life?! First my\nmarriage falls apart and then\xc2\x85"
Janice	 I know! I know! And then you lose your apartment! And then you lose your job!\nAnd then your ex-wife gets married so fast! And now the coffee\xc2\x97ahh!! Ross, we need to\ntalk.'
Ross	 Okay. Sometimes I feel\xc2\x85'
Janice	 No-no-no, no. I'm going to talk. I believe that the sun has set on our\nday in the sun."
Ross	 Huh?'
Janice	 (starting to cry) You're a very sweet person Ross, umm, unfortunately I don't\nthink I can take another second of you whining!!"
Ross	 Let-let me make sure I'm hearing this right, you're ending this with me because I'm\ntoo whiney? (Janice makes an agreeing sound.) So you're saying, I've become so whiney that\nI annoy you, Janice."
Janice	 Well yeah!!'
Ross	 OH\xc2\x85MY\xc2\x85GOD!!'
Janice	 Are you gonna be okay?'
Ross	 I am now.'
Janice	 Okay.'
Joey	 Umm, hi.'
Janice	 Oh hi! Well, I guess that's two out of three, Joey. (Laughs and exits.)"

Ross	 Dude, we got to talk.'
Chandler	 Okay.'
Ross	 I just wanted to tell you something before you heard it from someone else and I\nhope this isn't too weird, but uh, I had uh, a thing with Janice. (He laughs, his real\nlaugh this time.) What you're-you're not mad?"
Chandler	 Why would I be mad?'
Ross	 Well, because y'know there are certain rules about this kind of stuff. You don't\nuh, you don't fool around with your uh, friend's ex-girlfriends or possible girlfriends or\ngirls they're related to."
Chandler	 (realizes what Ross just said and the implications to him) I am mad! But you\nknow what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna forgive you! Because that's what friends do! They\nforgive their friends when they do everything you just said, all on the list there. Well,\nbut I want you to remember that I forgave you."
Ross	 Okay.'
Chandler	 I also want you to remember that I let you live here rent free!'
Ross	 All right.'
Chandler	 And, I want you to remember that I gave you twenty (counts his money) seven\ndollars. No strings attached. Now, if you can't remember that, I think we should write it\ndown\xc2\x97let's write it down!"
