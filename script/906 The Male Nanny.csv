Chandler	 (picking up the telephone, answering it with a frog \n  in his throat) Hello? (he clears his throat, but he still has the same frog \n  in his throat when he speaks again) Hello?'
Monica	 (in her apartment, screaming) I LOVE MY NEW JOB!'
Chandler	 Honey, you're screaming."
Monica	 YOU BET YOUR ASS I AM! I just had the best first day \n  ever! The kitchen
Chandler	 (yawning) Oh, that's great."
Monica	 Yeah, a-a-and clean. Not just health department clean... \n  Monica clean.'
Chandler	 (clearly not so interested) Awesome.'
Monica	 Oh, and the people are so nice. There's this one guy, \n  Geoffrey, he's the Maitre D., Chandler, you will love him. He is without a doubt, \n  the funniest guy I have ever met. (Chandler, who was almost asleep again, sits \n  up straight in bed in an instant and can't believe what he just heard.)"

Mike	 This is nice.'
Phoebe	 I know! (Phoebe picks up a little packet of sugar, \n  shakes it, and then realises she can't open it with one hand, but doesn't want \n  to let go of Mike's hand. She tries to tear open the packet with one hand.)"
Mike	 You need both hands for that?'
Phoebe	 Yeah, I kinda do. (Mike lets go of her hand) Well, \n  how's this? (she takes Mike's hand and puts it on her breast, she tears open \n  the sugar and puts it in her coffee. Mike thinks it over and nods appreciative. \n  After that, they hold hands again. Joey now enters, and sees the two sitting \n  on the couch, holding hands.)"
Joey	 (in a very aaaaahhhhh sweeeeeet voice) Aaahhh, look \n  at you two... holding hands... huh is this getting serious? (Phoebe and Mike, \n  embarrassed, start babbling and look away.) Have you not talked about it yet? \n  (They say nothing now, but smile) Am I making you uncomfortable? (smiles are \n  becoming forced now, and he speaks to Mike) If you were bigger you'd hit me, \n  huh...? Aaaaaahhhhhh (he turns away to the bar)"
Phoebe	 I'm sorry... I'm sorry. It's obviously way too early \n  for us to be... having that conversation."
Mike	 Is it?'
Phoebe	 (in a flash she answers) Maybe not, is it?'
Mike	 Okay, when I got divorced, I didn\'t think I\'d feel this \n  way about someone for a really long time... Then again, I didn\'t think I\'d meet \n  someone like you... and... this may be crazy soon, but... I want you to have \n  this... (He tries to get something from his pocket, but it\'s not that easy... \n  Phoebe looks in a "what\'s happening" face to him. He finally has found \n  something) No, not... that\'s gum. (He digs in a little more.) Ooh, five bucks... \n  I love it when that happens, you know... Think no note\'s there...'
Phoebe	 (impatient) I know Mike, why don't you keep digging?"
Mike	 Oh, sorry. (He digs in again and finally finds what \n  he's been looking for. A key.)"
Phoebe	 Oh, it's a key. To be honest, I think I'd prefer the \n  five dollars."
Mike	 It's to my apartment."
Phoebe	 (really surprised) Oh wow, ooh! Ooh, big step for \n  Phoebe and Mike.'
Mike	 Yeah, look, and I don't want you to feel like you have \n  to give me your key just because..."
Phoebe	 Oh no, I want to.'
Mike	 Oh, thank God. (he laughs nervously, and Phoebe gets \n  her keychain from her bag.)'
Phoebe	 Yeah... ooh... wow... Even started to think I'd never \n  meet someone that, you know, I wanted to... do this with. Here you go. (Both \n  Phoebe and Mike look really proud.)"
Mike	 Is this cool, huh?'
Phoebe	 It really is.'
Joey	 (sitting at his table) Oh, I know it... It \n  is amazing these little things open doors... huh! (mimes opening a door with \n  his own keys, Phoebe looks at him in a "yeah, yeah, yeah" way.)'
Rachel	 So I don't go back to work for another four weeks, \n  but we would like our nanny to start right away, so that Emma could get a chance \n  to know her."
Prospective nanny	 (in a sweet, caring voice) I think that's \n  really smart. The easier we can make the transition for her, the better. (Ross \n  and Rachel seem pleased with the answer.)"
Rachel	 That's great, great. So do you have any questions \n  for us?"
Prospective nanny	 Not really.'
Rachel	 Allright. Well thank you so much for coming... (they're \n  standing up and make their way to the door)"
Ross	 Thank you.'
Rachel	 Really nice to meet you... and we'll call you."
Prospective nanny	 Oh, you know, wait. I do have \n  one question. (she starts playing with her hair) Do you guys do random drug \n  testing?'
Ross	 Boy, we uhm... hadn't really thought of that."
Prospective nanny	 That's cool. But... but if you do, I'm \n  gonna need three days notice."
Rachel	 Okidoki! (and she slams the door in the nanny's face \n  while Ross crumples up the application form) Wow! We're never gonna find a nanny."
Ross	 Oh, come on Rach, we will. I promise. We have more interviews \n  (They sit down and Rachel sighs) And worse comes to worse, we can always reconsider \n  the uhm... the first one we met with.'
Rachel	 (indignant) What, the blonde with no bra?'
Ross	 She was blonde? (he looks surprised for a while, but \n  then gets a "gotcha" expression on his face... There\'s knocking at \n  the door.) Just a sec.! Okay, okay. This one\'s name is Sandy. She\'s got a degree \n  in early childhood education, uhm... she worked for her last family for three \n  years.'
Rachel	 Okay... (Ross opens the door.)'
Sandy	 (a guy) Hi... I'm Sandy."
Ross	 And she's a little mannish..."
Phoebe	 (gasps) Oh my God! David!'
David	 Hi! I-i-is this a bad time?'
Phoebe	 (excited) No! It's a great time, come in...! WOW, \n  hi... Oh my gosh! What are you doing here? Are you back from Minsk?"
David	 Well, just for a couple of days, uhm... I'm here to \n  explain to the people who gave us our grant, why it's a positive thing that \n  we spent all their money and uhm... accomplished uhm... nothing."
Phoebe	 Who cares, it got you here.'
David	 Well, it got me to New York anyway, and then I got \n  on a cab at the airport, and the guy said where to? and I just... gave him your \n  address I... I... I didn't even think about it."
Phoebe	 Wow. Where is your luggage? (David thinks for a while)'
David	 Damn it!'
Phoebe	 A-Allright, well... I'll call the cab company."
David	 Wa... wa... wait! We can... call them later. Can you \n  just... just stand there f-f-for a moment? Boy! There's an old Russian expression, \n  uhm... it goes
Phoebe	 Thank you! God, no! You should see me when... Oh actually, \n  no, I look pretty good.'
David	 Are... are you kidding? You know, when you don't see \n  someone for a long time, a-a-and you kind of build them up in your head and \n  you start thinking about
Phoebe	 No...'
Phoebe	 I'm... I'm just... I'm the worst person ever. How \n  can I not tell David that I'm seeing Mike?"
Monica	 Maybe he didn't give you a chance."
Phoebe	 He said
Monica	 Oh, well... That had been your window.'
Phoebe	 Yeah! I mean, I don't know. I was just , I was looking, \n  I was looking in his eyes and I was just thinking
Monica	 Really? The scientist guy?'
Phoebe	 Really? Chandler?'
Monica	 Continue...'
Phoebe	 Oh.Okay, then it gets worse, 'cause then I told him \n  that I would see him tomorrow night."
Monica	 Phoebe!'
Phoebe	 I know! (points at herself) Evil! And... and... and... \n  I like Mike so much, you know. It's just going really well. Oh my God!"
Monica	 Wow, isn't it ironic that David would show up on the \n  same day that you and Mike exchange keys?"
Phoebe	 (sarcastically) Uhuh... Yeah...!, you know. And given \n  my life long search for irony, you can imagine how happy I am.'
Monica	 What are you gonna do?'
Phoebe	 I mean I guess, I just have to... tell David that \n  nothing can happen between us. Unless I don't... You know, complicated \n  moral situation, no right, no wrong..."
Monica	 You have to tell David!'
Phoebe	 Okay, I knew I should have had this conversation \n  with Joey.'
Chandler	 (angry) Funniest guy she's ever met! (to the door) \n  I'm funny, right...? What do you know, you're a door... You just like knock-knock \n  jokes... (laughs about himself, but then gets determined again) Save it for \n  inside! (he enters)"
Monica	 Heeeeeey! '
Chandler	 Hey!'
Phoebe	 Hey!'
Chandler	 So... Oklahoma is a crazy place. You know, they \n  call it the Sooner state. Frankly I'd sooner be in any other state. (Monica \n  looks at Phoebe, who also doesn't know what to say.) And what's with Oklahoma \n  having a pan handle? Can all states have stuff like that? Hey yeah, I'm from \n  the waistband, Wyoming. But when I was seven, we headed over to the crotch."
Monica	 (Doesn't believe what she's hearing) Was your cabin \n  pressurised?"
Chandler	 (laughs, but then moves to Phoebe) And don't get \n  me started on the way that people from Tulsa talk."
Phoebe	 Okay. (and she walks away)'
Chandler	 What's with the word y'all? You know, just... two \n  words just... pushed together... Are we all allowed to do that, because if so, \n  I say why stop there? You know, your new poodle could be your noodle. And fried \n  chicken? Could be fricken.Waiter, waiter excuse me, I'll have the fricken? (Monica \n  laughs) See, that's... that's funny with the fricken, right?"
Monica	 No, it just remind me of something this guy did today \n  at work. I told you about that funny guy, Geoffrey, right?'
Chandler	 Yeah, he came up...'
Monica	 Well, he did this bit... You probably had to be there, \n  but it was Liza Minelli locked in our freezer, eating a raw chicken. (Phoebe \n  bursts out in a laugh)'
Chandler	 (to Phoebe) Were you there?'
Phoebe	 No, but it sounds like it was fricken funny...'
Sandy	 I really do understand how hard it's gotta be to leave \n  your child with another person. I mean, it's leaving behind a piece of your \n  heart... (Ross has got that bored/angry/skeptic look and Rachel is very emotional)"
Rachel	 Sandy, that's exactly what it is..."
Ross	 Are you gay? (Rachel turns to Ross in an embarrassed \n  way)'
Rachel	 Ross!'
Sandy	 It's okay. I get that a lot doing what I do. But I \n  am straight. I-I'm engaged actually."
Rachel	 Oh!'
Sandy	 Her name is Deliah.'
Rachel	 Oh, that's pretty."
Ross	 (skeptic) So you're just like a... guy who's a nanny?"
Sandy	 I realise how it's... a bit unorthodox for some people, \n  but I really believe, the most satisfying thing you can do with your life, is \n  take care of a child."
Ross	 (on a yeah, right tone) Okay.'
Sandy	 Like in my last job, I met Daniel when he was three \n  weeks old. And I got to watch him grow into this awesome person... \n  When I left, I said
Ross	 Yeah, kids say all kinds of crap. (In the other room \n  Emma starts to cry.)'
Rachel	 Oh God, she mu... she must need her diaper changed.'
Sandy	 Oh, oh, I can do it for her, if you want...'
Rachel	 Oh, that would be great! (Sandy leaves for Emma's \n  room) I love him, I love him, I love him..."
Ross	 Oh, come on, Rach, he's a guy!"
Rachel	 So wh..? He's smart, he's qualified. Give me one good \n  reason we shouldn't try him out."
Ross	 Because, it's weird!"
Rachel	 Why?'
Ross	 What kind of job is that for a man? A nanny? I-It's \n  like if a woman wanted to be..."
Rachel	 (she\'s got that "yeah, try to say it" look \n  on her face) Yes?'
Ross	 King?'
Sandy	 I er... I hope you don't mind. I used some of my home-made \n  lotion on Emma. It's a mixture of calendula and honey cream. It'll dry that \n  rash right up. Plus... It keeps the hands young... (it makes Rachel smile)"
Rachel	 (whispering and begging) Please? (Ross makes a "whatever" \n  gesture) YES! Sandy you\'re hired.'
Sandy	 That's great! (He gets emotional again and waves his \n  hand in front of his face in a feminine way, like trying to dry his tears) I'm \n  sorry. It's just... such an emotional thing when you're welcomed into a new \n  family..."
Ross	 You gotta be at least bi...'

Chandler	 Hey! (Joey doesn't look up, but gestures 'wait a \n  minute' with his finger while he finishes reading the article. Chandler waits \n  for Joey to finish.) I need you to set me up for a joke. Later, when Monica \n  is around, I need you to ask me about fire trucks."
Joey	 Ooh. I-I don't know Chan. I'm not so good with remembering \n  lines."
Chandler	 (Can't believe what he hears) Well, thank God your \n  livelihood doesn't depend on it."
Joey	 I know, right? (Chandler has really big eyes, and nods) \n  Wh... Wh... Why are we doing this?'
Chandler	 Monica says that her Maitre D. is the funniest guy \n  she's ever met."
Joey	 Seriously? She actually said that?'
Chandler	 Yes! Am I crazy to be this upset?'
Joey	 Nooooo! Being funny is your thing!'
Chandler	 Yeah!'
Joey	 Without that, you just got "lame with women".'
Chandler	 Ye.... (stops because he realises what Joey just \n  said, and stares at him. At this moment Monica enters)'
Monica	 Hi! There you are.'
Joey	 (sees Monica) Fire trucks! (Chandlers eyes double in \n  size and he turns to Monica who doesn\'t understand what\'s happening. Then he \n  turns back to Joey, who says "you\'re welcome" without a sound)'
David	 Wow, you look even... more beautiful than you did yesterday.'
Phoebe	 Oof...'
David	 In fact, ehm... I going to kiss you now. (David holds \n  Phoebe and wants to kiss her.)'
Phoebe	 Oh, wait, wait!'
David	 Yeah, I-I don't, I can't get away with stuff like that. \n  I-I-It sounded sexy in my head, so I..."
Phoebe	 No, no, it's not that. (they go sit on the couch) \n  Uhm... Remember when you asked me if I was seeing someone and I said no? Well, \n  uhm... I am. His ... his name is Mike."
David	 Oh... oh...'
Phoebe	 Yeah, I should have told you.'
David	 No... well, yeah.'
Phoebe	 I'm sorry, I'm sorry."
David	 Well, i-it's okay. I-I-I understand... Well, s... well, \n  are you happy with this guy?"
Phoebe	 I am happy.'
David	 Damn it! I-I'm sorry. I-I don't mean that. I-I want \n  you to be happy... But only with me. No, uhm... that's not fair. Uh, who cares, \n  leave him!. Oh, I don't mean that. Yes I do... I'm sorry Uhm, I... I think I \n  should probably uhm... go..."
Phoebe	 Well... but David, just... I just want you to know \n  that... that... you know... telling you this... is one of the hardest things \n  I've ever had to do."
David	 Well... just so you know... hearing it wasn't exactly \n  a Vladnik carnival either... Can we at least hug goodbye?"
Phoebe	 Of course, yeah.(they hug and Phoebe sighs... a little \n  after that also David sighs and makes his way to the door) You know, a kiss \n  on the cheek wouldn't be totally inappropriate..."
David	 No... no...'
Phoebe	 I mean... (David kisses Phoebe on the cheek, makes \n  his way to the door and turns around again)'
David	 In Minsk...'
Phoebe	 Yeah?'
David	 ...it's uhm... i-it's two on each cheek and uhm... \n  and one on the lips."
Phoebe	 Well, if that's what they do in Minsk... (They kiss \n  2 on each cheek... and then they pause... David turns to the door) In New York... \n  it's... (and then David grabs her by her neck and kisses her full on the lips... \n  They kiss passionately and cannot seem to stop.)"
Rachel	 (in a tearful voice) Oh... Oh boy... (she turns around \n  and sees Ross) Hi...'
Ross	 (very worried) Is everything allright?'
Rachel	 Oh yeah, it's fine, it's fine. Sandy was just... was \n  just telling me about how he proposed to his fianc\xc3\xa9e and it was just \n  sooo beautiful."
Sandy	 Well, her favourite flower is the camellia. From the \n  poem...'
Rachel	 I can't... I can't hear it again."
Sandy	 You know, I can't tell it again... (wipes his tears \n  again)"
Ross	 And I\'m fine never having heard it... (Rachel looks \n  at Ross in a "why do you say that" manner) Rach, can I... can I see \n  you for a sec?'
Rachel	 Yeah! (to Sandy) Excuse me... (She walks to the kitchen \n  with Ross and sighs)'
Ross	 Do you realise that man has cried in our apartment three \n  times...? Huh? I haven't cried that many times since I moved in."
Rachel	 Look, Ross, he's just... Sandy is just sensitive, \n  that's all."
Ross	 (picks up a cookie) Okay, okay, see... that... that \n  is the problem. He is too sensitive. (takes a bite from the cookie)'
Rachel	 What...? Too sensitive to take care of our baby?'
Ross	 (speaking with his mouth full) Yeah, I mean, all things \n  that guy... (looks at the cookie) These are amazing!'
Rachel	 Sandy made Madeleines.'
Ross	 This... this is exactly what I'm talking about. What \n  kind of a guy makes... makes... delicate French cookies, huh? They're not even... \n  butch, manly cookies with... with... you know with... with chunks. (takes a \n  careful bite from the cookie)"
Rachel	 Well, I... you know, I-I-I don't know what to say... \n  I mean, I never thought of you as a guy who needed his men to be men. \n  You know, 'cause I gotta tell you Ross, it not like you just came in \n  from branding cattle."
Ross	 Hey... there's sensitive... and there is too sensitive."
Rachel	 Okay, what? What is too sensitive? (There's \n  music coming from the living room. Ross opens the door to the living room and \n  he and Rachel see Sandy play a song for Emma on his recorder. Rachel is moved \n  by this, but Ross only sees his point proven again, and walks back into the \n  kitchen, angrily. The door he was holding, swings back and hits Rachel.)"
Phoebe	 Hmmm... No, no... No, I can't do this. It's bad."
David	 But... I-I-It's nice... A-a-and... nice is good. A-a-and \n  good is not bad, ergo, w-w-we should keep kissing."
Phoebe	 No, no. No.'
David	 But... ergo...'
Phoebe	 Look David, if... if you had never left, then... yeah, \n  we'd probably still be together right now, but... you did leave, and I-I'm with \n  Mike and I really care about him..."
David	 Uhm... uhm... Goodbye... Uh... Schto ya ztez vigul... \n  ui... (David holds his hands gently on the back of Phoebe's neck. There's \n  a sound of a a bunch of keys rattling, and the door opens... It's Mike)"
Mike	 Well... hey, the key works...! (he looks as if he doesn't \n  want to believe what's happening)"
Phoebe	 (points to David) And you thanks for the \n  face massage. Thank you.'
Ross	 Did Rachel tell you we hired a male nanny?'
Monica	 Yeah! I think that's great!"
Ross	 Oh really? Did she tell you he plays the recorder, recites \n  poetry and bakes Madeleines?'
Monica	 Oh... How are they?'
Ross	 (looks like in heaven) Lighter than air... (changes \n  back to serious) But that's not the point. (Joey now also enters)"
Joey	 Hey!'
Ross	 Hey...! Rachel and I hired a male nanny.'
Joey	 (looks surprised) Really...? Guys do that...? That's... \n  weird..."
Ross	 Thank you!'
Joey	 That's like a woman wanting to be a..."
Ross	 ...a what? A what? What's the end of that sentence?"
Monica	 Yes... What is the end of that sentence?'
Joey	 Uhm... A penis model. (Monica can't believe what's she's \n  hearing and Ross pats Joey on the back.) Anyway, hey... Did you tell Chandler \n  that some guy from work is the funniest guy you've ever met?"
Monica	 Yeah, so?'
Ross	 Wow!'
Joey	 Really? Do you not know Chandler?'
Monica	 Is that why he's acting so weird...? He's jealous...? \n  Oh my God, that is crazy. It's not like I'm attracted to Geoffrey..."
Joey	 So what? Being funny is Chandler's thing... \n  You know, like Ross's thing is... (he can't come up with anything)"
Ross	 Science...? Academia...? Being a good father...?'
Joey	 ...No... (he just can't seem to grasp it)"
Monica	 I can't believe he's that upset about this..."
Joey	 Monica, you have to do some damage control here, okay. \n  'Cause he's feeling like... (the door opens and Chandler walks in with a pizza)"
Chandler	 Hey!'
Joey	 Heeeyy! Hey!'
Chandler	 What are you guys talking about?'
Ross	 Uhm... Rachel and I hired a male nanny. (Joey makes \n  a gesture and sound like "Can you believe that?")'
Chandler	 You got a man who's a nanny...? You got a manny...? \n  (Monica starts laughing, but very exaggerated. Joey realises they also should \n  laugh and punches Ross. Now all three of them laugh, but very fake. Chandler \n  seems happy again.)"
Chandler	 You know, I don't mind a... male nanny, but I do \n  draw the line at a male wetnurse. (again they laugh, even more fake than before)"
Monica	 Ohhh, ooohhh... you are on a roll, mister!'
Chandler	 If I'd known you guys were coming over, I would \n  have brought more pizza. (they all burst out in a thundering laugh)"
Monica	 Okay, okay... Chandler you... you stop it! (Monica \n  wipes away tears)'
Chandler	 What is so funny about that? (they realise \n  it wasn't a joke)"
Monica	 Well, I don't know... I-It's... just the way you say \n  it... I mean, you're funny... You have that funny thing. You're a funny guy! \n  (Chandler turns to Joey)"
Chandler	 Did you tell her what we talked about? (Joey starts \n  laughing hysterically, but then gets serious again...)'
Joey	 Yeah....'
Chandler	 So those were pity laughs? PITY LAUGHS? (Joey and \n  Ross walk away from the kitchen)'
Monica	 Honey, listen... You have nothing to worry about with \n  Geoffrey.'
Chandler	 Oh yeah? Is he funnier than me?'
Monica	 Well, you're... you're different funny... I mean, \n  you're... you're more sarcastic a-a-and... well, he does... bits... and impressions... \n  and... and limericks..."
Chandler	 I do limericks... uhm... There once was a man named \n  Chandler, whose wife made him die inside.'
Monica	 Honey, you know I think you're hilarious! Come on, \n  you know that joke you told me last week? The one about Jerry Lewis and the \n  girl with the lazy eye...? (he laughs) That slayed me."
Ross	 Hey... I made up that joke and told it to you! (He points \n  at Chandler. Joey gestures to Ross "What are you doing?)'
Joey	 Not knowing when to shut up...'
Ross	 Yep! That's my thing..."

Mike	 So... how many guys have your key?'
Phoebe	 No, no, no, no, no... It's not... it's not... i'ts \n  not as bad as it looks... really. I was just saying goodbye to an old friend."
Mike	 Your lipstick's on his mouth."
David	 Oh, uh... we just uh... happen to wear the same shade.'
Phoebe	 No, uhm... David and I did use to go out... but years \n  ago, and he lives in Minsk. He's only... he's only in town for a couple of days."
Mike	 Did you uhm...'
Phoebe	 No, no... '
Mike	 ...kiss him?'
Phoebe	 Oh, well, yeah...'
David	 Yes, but uhm... You should know... she really likes \n  you. I-In fact I-I-I don't think you realise j-just how lucky you are fella. \n  (he points at Mike)"
Mike	 Don't point your finger at me."
David	 Why? Wh-What are you going to do about it?'
Mike	 Well... I'll... just show you what I'm gonna do about \n  it... (he hits David's finger with his finger and they start to finger-fight \n  using their fingers as swords saying all kinds of macho crap)"
Phoebe	 Stop it! Stop it, before someone gets really hurt! \n  (they stop and Phoebe gets David's jacket and gives it to him) Here David, you \n  should just go."
David	 Allright... But... if I ever do come back \n  from Minsk... (points at Mike) well, you just better watch out.'
Mike	 Well, if I ever goto Minsk, you'd \n  better watch out."
David	 Oh, you're going to Minsk?"
Mike	 Well, I might.'
David	 Really? Well, if you do, come in the spring. It's just \n  lovely there."
Phoebe	 Okay, well... guys?'
David	 Right... Goodbye Phoebe. (Makes a move to kiss her.)'
Mike	 Hey, what are you kidding me?'
David	 Right-o, right-o... (to Mike) Take good care of her. \n  (and he leaves)'
Phoebe	 I'm sorry, I'm so sorry. If you... If you want your \n  key back, I totally understand."
Mike	 It's never gonna happen again right?"
Phoebe	 Right! Never! Never! I swear! (They kiss... The door \n  opens and David comes in again.)'
David	 I-I... Oh I...I just wanna say uhm... if you do ever \n  come to Minsk, that's my number (gives Mike a business card) We'll uhm... we'll \n  party up Vladnik style. (He leaves again)"
Joey	 Yeah! Allright! Hey, hey Ross. Check it out! Sandy taught \n  me Hot-cross Buns.'
Ross	 Really? Sounded like Three Blind Mice.'
Joey	 Noooo... Three Blind Mice goes like this... (he puts \n  his fingers in position on the recorder)'
Ross	 (looks angrily at Joey and points at him) I swear to \n  God...! (Joey is in shock)'
Sandy	 Who's up for puppets?"
Joey	 Me! I'm up for puppets!"
Sandy	 Well, please welcome... The Snufflebumps... Who wants \n  to be mr. Wigglemunch and who's gonna be the Grumpus?"
Ross	 Okay, okay... How exactly is a two month old supposed \n  to appreciate puppets?'
Sandy	 Actually studies have shown that the movement and colours \n  help their cerebral development... The whimsical characters are just for us. \n  (He winks to Joey and Rachel. Ross's face says he disapproves. Joey sees that \n  and kind of angrily says...)"
Joey	 I wanna be mr. Wigglemunch. (and makes a "there" \n  nod to Ross)'
Ross	 (shakes his head) Oh my God!'
Sandy	 Well, I guess we know who's gonna be the Grumpus... \n  (Ross goes to the kitchen)"
Rachel	 That was kind of rude!'
Ross	 Oh, I'm sorry. Please apologise to Sandy and the Snufflebumps \n  for me."
Rachel	 You know, he was just doing his job...'
Ross	 Well, you know what... I-I'm sorry I'm the only one \n  who isn't in love with Gary Poppins out there... But I just... I can't... I \n  can't go through with this."
Rachel	 Oh, come on Ross...'
Ross	 No! Hey, you know what? I'm sorry. I would never force \n  you... to hire someone you were this uncomfortable with..."
Rachel	 (sighs) Oh... That's true."
Ross	 Thank you!'
Rachel	 Well, you're the one who wants to fire him, so you're \n  gonna have to do it. (Ross walks to the living room determined to fire Sandy)"
Sandy	 (In a puppet voice) So you see Wigglemunch, that's \n  why it's important to shaaaaaaare..."
Joey	 (kind of emotional) I am learning so much from you.'
Chandler	 Well, I'm off to Tulsa, so if your Maitre D. friend \n  has any funny Oklahoma jokes, tell him to e-mail me at www.hahanotsomuch.com."
Monica	 Honey, you can relax. Last night at work, Geoffrey \n  told this really sexist joke. After that, not so funny anymore.'
Chandler	 Really...? See... that's the thing
Monica	 Okay, don't miss that flight. You know I love you."
Chandler	 I love you too. (Monica and Chandler kiss. He turns \n  to Joey.) And... I like you as a friend. (They hug and pat each other on the \n  back.) '
Joey	 Allright. See you later!'
Chandler	 See ya! (he leaves the apartment)'
Joey	 (to Monica) Did that guy really make that joke?'
Monica	 Naaaa... He still kills me. Last night he had me laughing \n  so hard, I swear... a little pee came out.'
Ross	 Here goes...'
Rachel	 I can't watch. It's like firing Elmo. (Ross walks \n  to the couch where Sandy sits)"
Ross	 Sandy... Hi, we uhm... we kinda need to talk. I'm afraid \n  it's not working out."
Sandy	 (surprised) Oh...'
Ross	 Yeah, uhm... I mean, Rachel and I, think you are great... \n  with Emma... uhm... We just feel...'
Rachel	 (from behind the bedroom door) YOU! You feel!'
Ross	 I... just feel that the... the chemistry isn't right. \n  I'm sorry. We're... we're more than happy to give you good recommendation..."
Sandy	 Oh, no, no, no... That's okay. I got a lot of offers \n  from other families. I just picked you guys because... I liked you the best."
Rachel	 (from bedroom) Oh, damn you Geller!'
Ross	 Anyway, uhm...Well, I'm glad there's no hard feelings."
Sandy	 No, none at all. You need to be happy with whoever \n  is in your home... Although if you don't mind telling me, what was your problem? \n  Maybe it's something I can work on in the future."
Ross	 No, you know, it's uhm... nothing you did, it's... it's \n  uhm... my issue."
Sandy	 What is it...? (Ross hesitates) Please...? (he tilts \n  his head)'
Ross	 You know, I'm just not uhm... that comfortable with \n  a guy who's as sensitive as you."
Sandy	 That's fair... Although, can I ask... why do you think \n  that is?"
Ross	 Why... I... I don't know. (Sandy tilts his head again) \n  Uhm... errrr... maybe... maybe because of my father?"
Sandy	 hmmm... (and shakes his head)'
Ross	 I mean, uhm... you know when I was growing up he was \n  kind of a tough guy... You know a-a-and as a kid I wasn't the athlete I am now."
Rachel	 (from the bedroom) Huh ha ha!'
Ross	 I play squash...! Anyway, uhm... I uhm... I always get \n  the feeling he thought I was too sensitive.'
Sandy	 That must have been hard.'
Ross	 It was hard... I remember... I was in my bedroom... \n  playing with my dinosaurs... playing and learning... and my father \n  walks in and says... he says... "What are you doing with those things? \n  What\'s wrong with you, why aren\'t you... why aren\'t you outside playing like \n  a... like a real boy?'
Sandy	 But you are a real boy!'
Ross	 I know I am! (Ross now starts to cry) ...And when it's \n  summer, and it's hot, why can't you wear a tank top?"
Sandy	 It's allright! Crying is good. It lets the boo-hoos \n  out. "
Ross	 Here come some more...'

Sandy/Grumpus	 And what's the one kind of boat that can never, \n  ever sink?"
Joey/Wigglemunch	 What kind?'
Sandy/Grumpus	 A friend-ship...'
Joey	 Wow! You blow my mind...'
Sandy	 Oh, I gotta go.'
Joey	 Aaahh... How much do I owe you?'
Sandy	 Twenty bucks.'
Joey	 It's like the cheapest college ever."
