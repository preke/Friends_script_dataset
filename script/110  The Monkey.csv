Ross	 Guys? There's a somebody I'd like you to meet. "
All	 Oooh!'
Monica	 W-wait. What is that?'
Ross	 'That' would be Marcel. You wanna say hi?"
Monica	 No, no, I don't."
Rachel	 Oh, he is precious! Where did you get him?'
Ross	 My friend Bethel rescued him from some lab.'
Phoebe	 That is so cruel! Why? Why would a parent name their child Bethel?'
Chandler	 Hey, that monkey's got a Ross on its ass!"
Monica	 Ross, is he gonna live with you, like, in your apartment?'
Ross	 Yeah. I mean, it's been kinda quiet since Carol left, so..."
Monica	 Why don't you just get a roommate?"
Ross	 Nah, I dunno... I think you reach a certain age, having a roommate is\nkinda pathe- (Realises) ....sorry, that's, that's 'pathet', which is Sanskrit for 'really\ncool way to live'."

Phoebe	 So you guys, I'm doing all new material tonight. I have twelve new songs\nabout my mother's suicide, and one about a snowman."
Chandler	 Might wanna open with the snowman.'
All	 Hey, Joey. Hey, buddy.'
Monica	 So, how'd it go?"
Joey	 Ahhhhhh, I didn't get the job."
Ross	 How could you not get it? You were Santa last year.'
Joey	 I dunno. Some fat guy's sleeping with the store manager. He's not even\njolly, it's all political."
Monica	 So what are you gonna be?'
Joey	 Ah, I'm gonna be one of his helpers. It's just such a slap in the face,\ny'know?"
Rachel	 Hey, do you guys know what you're doing for New Year's? (They all\nprotest and hit her with cushions) Gee, what?! What is wrong with New Year's?"
Chandler	 Nothing for you, you have Paolo. You don't have to face the horrible\npressures of this holiday
Rachel	 Well, for your information, Paolo is gonna be in Rome this New Year, so\nI'll be just as pathetic as the rest of you. "
Phoebe	 Yeah, you wish!'
Chandler	 It's just that I'm sick of being a victim of this Dick Clark holiday.\nI say this year, no dates, we make a pact. Just the six of us- dinner."
All	 Yeah, okay. Alright.'
Chandler	 Y'know, I was hoping for a little more enthusiasm. "
All	 Woooo! Yeah!'
Rachel	 Phoebe, you're on."
Phoebe	 Oh, oh, good.'
Rachel	 (Into microphone) Okay, hi. Ladies and gentlemen, back by popular\ndemand, Miss Phoebe Buffay. Wooh!'
Phoebe	 (Takes mike) Thanks, hi. Um, I wanna start with a song that means a lot\nto me this time of year. (Shakes bell as an introduction) (Sung
Phoebe	 (Sung) '
Phoebe	 (Sung) '
Max	 No. No, that's- that's okay."
Phoebe	 Well, c'mon, if it's important enough to discuss while I'm playing, then\nI assume it's important enough for everyone else to hear!"
Chandler	 (Quietly, to the others) That guy's going home with a note!"
David	 Noth- I was- I was just saying to my-'
Phoebe	 Could you speak up please?'
David	 (Stands up and speaks more loudly) Sorry, I wa- I was just saying to my\nfriend that I thought you were the most beautiful woman that I'd ever seen in my- in my\nlife. And then he said that- you said you thought"
Max	 Daryl Hannah.'
David	 Daryl Hannah was the most beautiful woman that he'd ever seen in his life\nand I said yeah, I liked her in Splash, a lot, but not so much in- in Wall Street, I\nthought she had kind of a "
Max	 Hard quality.'
David	 -hard quality. And uh, while Daryl Hannah is beautiful in a conventional\nway, you are luminous with a kind of a delicate grace. Then, uh, that-that-that's when you\nstarted yelling. (Sits down)"
Phoebe	 Okay, we're gonna take a short break. (Goes over to their table)"
Joey	 Hey, that guy's going home with more than a note!"
Ross	 Come here, Marcel. Sit here. (Marcel wanders off)'
Rachel	 Pheebs, I can't believe he hasn't kissed you yet. I mean God, by my\nsixth date with Paolo, I mean he had already named both my breasts! ...Ooh. Did I just\nshare too much?"
Ross	 Just a smidge.'
Phoebe	 David's like, y'know, Scientist Guy. He's very methodical."
Monica	 I think it's romantic."
Phoebe	 Me too! Oh! Did you ever see An Officer and a Gentleman?'
Rachel	 Yeah!'
Phoebe	 Well, he's kinda like the guy I went to see that with. Except, except\nhe-he's smarter, and gentler, and sweeter... I just- I just wanna be with him all the\ntime. Day and night, and night and day... and special occasions... "
Chandler	 Wait a minute, wait a minute, I see where this is going, you're gonna\nask him to New Year's, aren't you. You're gonna break the pact. She's gonna break the\npact."
Phoebe	 No, no, no, no, no, no. Yeah, could I just?'
Chandler	 Yeah, 'cause I already asked Janice."
Monica	 What?!'
Ross	 C'mon, this was a pact! This was your pact! "
Chandler	 I snapped, okay? I couldn't handle the pressure and I snapped."
Monica	 Yeah, but Janice? That-that was like the worst breakup in history!'
Chandler	 I'm not saying it was a good idea, I'm saying I snapped!"
Joey	 Hi. Hi, sorry I'm late."
Chandler	 Too many jokes... must mock Joey! '
Joey	 Nice shoes, huh? (He wiggles his foot and the bells tinkle)'
Chandler	 Aah, y'killing me!"
Monica	 Ross! He's playing with my spatulas again!"
Ross	 Okay, look, he's not gonna hurt them, right?"
Monica	 Do you always have to bring him here?'
Ross	 I didn't wanna leave him alone. Alright? We- we had our first fight this\nmorning. I think it has to do with my working late. I said some things that I didn't mean,\nand he- he threw some faeces..."
Chandler	 Y'know, if you're gonna work late, I could look in on him for you."
Ross	 Oh, that'd be great! Okay, but if you do, make sure it seems like you're\nthere to see him, okay, and you're not like doing it as a favour to me."
Chandler	 Okay, but if he asks, I'm not going to lie."
David	 ...But, you can't actually test this theory, because today's particle\naccelerators are nowhere near powerful enough to simulate these conditions."
Phoebe	 Okay, alright, I have a question, then. '
David	 Yuh.'
Phoebe	 Um, were you planning on kissing me ever?'
David	 Uh, that's definitely a, uh, valid question. And, uh, the answer would be\n(Writes YES on the board) yes. Yes I was. But, see, I wanted it to be this phenomenal kiss\nthat happened at this phenomenal moment, because, well, 'cause it's you."
Phoebe	 Sure.'
David	 Right. But, see, the longer I waited, the more phenomenal the kiss had to\nbe, and now we've reached a place where it's just gotta be one of those things where I\njust like... sweep everything off the table and throw you down on it. And, uh, I'm not\nreally a, uh, sweeping sorta fella."
Phoebe	 Oh, David, I, I think you are a sweeping sorta fella. I mean, you're a\nsweeper! ...trapped inside a physicist's body."
David	 Rrrreally.'
Phoebe	 Oh, yeah, oh, I'm sure of it. You should just do it, just sweep and\nthrow me. "
David	 ...Now? Now?'
Phoebe	 Oh yeah, right now.'
David	 Okay, okay, okay. (Gets ready to sweep, and then picks up a laptop\ncomputer) Y'know what, this was just really expensive. (Puts it down elsewhere. Then picks\nup a microscope) And I'll take- this was a gift. (Moves it)"
Phoebe	 Okay, now you're just kinda tidying. "
David	 Okay, what the hell, what the hell. (Sweeps the remaining papers off the\ndesk and grabs Phoebe) You want me to actually throw you or you-you wanna just hop?'
Phoebe	 I can hop. (She hops onto the table)'
Ross	 So tell me something. What does the phrase 'no date pact' mean to you?"
Monica	 I'm sorry, okay. It's just that Chandler has somebody, and Phoebe has\nsomebody- I thought I'd ask Fun Bobby."
Chandler	 Fun Bobby? Your ex-boyfriend Fun Bobby?'
Monica	 Yeah.'
Joey	 You know more than one Fun Bobby?'
Chandler	 I happen to know a Fun Bob.'
Rachel	 (Brings Joey a mug of coffee) Okay, here we go...'
Joey	 Ooh ooh ooh ooh, there's no room for milk!"
Rachel	 (Glances at Joey and then sips his coffee) There. Now there is.'
Ross	 Okay, so on our no-date evening, three of you now have dates.'
Joey	 Uh, four.'
Ross	 Four.'
Rachel	 Five.'
Ross	 Five. (Buries his head in his hands)'
Rachel	 Sorry. Paolo's catching an earlier flight."
Joey	 Yeah, and I met this really hot single mom at the store. What's an elf to\ndo?"
Ross	 Okay, so I'm gonna be the only one standing there alone when the ball\ndrops?"
Rachel	 Oh, c'mon. We'll have, we'll have a big party, and no-one'll know who's\nwith who."
Ross	 Hey, y'know, this is so not what I needed right now."
Monica	 What's the matter?"
Ross	 Oh, it's-it's Marcel. He keeps shutting me out, y'know? He's walking\naround all the time dragging his hands... "
Chandler	 That's so weird, I had such a blast with him the other night."
Ross	 Really.'
Chandler	 Yeah, we played, we watched TV.. that juggling thing is amazing.'
Ross	 What, uh... what juggling thing?'
Chandler	 With the balled-up socks? I figured you taught him that.'
Ross	 No.'
Chandler	 Y'know, it wasn't that big a deal. He just balled up socks... and a\nmelon..."
Max	 Phoebe. Hi. '
Phoebe	 Oh, hi Max! Hey, do you know everybody?'
Max	 No. Have you seen David?'
Phoebe	 No, no, he hasn't been around."
Max	 Well, if you see him, tell him to pack his bags. We are going to Minsk.'
Phoebe	 Minsk?'
Max	 Minsk. It's in Russia."
Phoebe	 I know where Minsk is.'
Max	 We got the grant. Three years, all expenses paid.'
Phoebe	 So when, when do you leave?'
Max	 January first.'

Phoebe	 Hello?'
David	 Hey!'
Phoebe	 Hi.'
David	 Hi! (Kisses her) What-what're you doing here?"
Phoebe	 Um, well, Max told me about Minsk, so (Puts on a fake cheery voice)\ncongratulations! This is so exciting!'
Max	 It'd be even more exciting if we were going."
Phoebe	 Oh, you're not going? (Fake disappointed voice) Oh, why?"
Max	 Tell her, David. 'I don't wanna go to Minsk and work with Lifson and\nYamaguchi and Flench, on nonononononono. I wanna stay here and make out with my\ngirlfriend!!' (Storms out)"
David	 Thank you, Max. Thank you.'
Phoebe	 So-so you're really not going?"
David	 I don't know. I don't know what I'm gonna do. I just- you decide."
Phoebe	 Oh don't do that."
David	 Please.'
Phoebe	 Oh no no.'
David	 No, but I'm asking-"
Phoebe	 Oh, but I can't do that-"
David	 No, but I can't-"
Phoebe	 It's your thing, and-"
David	 -make the decision-'
Phoebe	 Okay, um, stay.'
David	 Stay.'
Phoebe	 Stay.'
Phoebe	 Getting so good at that! (She hops on)'
David	 It was Max's stuff. (They kiss)"
Janice	 I love this artichoke thing! Oh, don't tell me what's in it, the diet\nstarts tomorrow! (Laughs her Janice laugh)"
Chandler	 You remember Janice.'
Monica	 Vividly.'
Monica	 Hi.'
Sandy	 Hi, I'm Sandy."
Joey	 Sandy! Hi! C'mon in! (She enters, followed by a young boy and a younger\ngirl)...You brought your kids."
Sandy	 Yeah. That's okay, right?"
Ross	 Par-tay! '
Monica	 That thing is not coming in here.'
Ross	 'That thing'? This is how you greet guests at a party? Let me ask you\nsomething, if I showed up here with my new girlfriend, she wouldn't be welcome in your\nhome?"
Monica	 I'm guessing your new girlfriend wouldn't urinate on my coffee table."
Ross	 Okay. He was more embarrassed about that than anyone. Okay? And for him to\nhave the courage to walk back in here like nothing happened...'
Monica	 Alright. Just keep him away from me.'
Ross	 Thank you. (She walks off) C'mon, Marcel, whaddya say you and I do a\nlittle mingling? (Marcel runs off) Alright, I'll, uh... catch up with you later."
Monica	 Oh my gosh! Rachel, honey.. are you okay? Where-where's Paolo?"
Rachel	 Rome. Jerk missed his flight.'
Phoebe	 And then... your face is bloated?'
Rachel	 No. Okay. I was at the airport, getting into a cab, when this woman-\nthis blonde planet with a pocketbook- starts yelling at me. Something about how it was her\ncab first. And then the next thing I know she just starts- starts pulling me out by my\nhair! So I'm blowing my attack whistle thingy and three more cabs show up, and as I'm\ngoing to get into a cab she tackles me. And I hit my head on the kerb and cut my lip on my\nwhistle...oh...everybody having fun at the party? (To Monica) Are people eating my dip?"
Sandy	 Y'know, when I saw you at the store last week, it was probably the first\ntime I ever mentally undressed an elf."
Joey	 Wow, that's, uh, dirty."
Sandy	 Yeah.'
Joey	 Hey, kids...'
Ross	 (Watching Marcel play with Phoebe. To Chandler) Look at him. I'm not\nsaying he has to spend the whole evening with me, but at least check in."
Janice	 (Startles them) There you are! Haaah, you got away from me!'
Chandler	 (Imitating) But you found me!'
Janice	 Here, Ross, take our picture. (Hands him a camera and he starts\nsnapping) Smile! You're on Janice Camera!"
Chandler	 Kill me. Kill me now. '
Monica	 Hey everybody! It's Fun Bobby!"
Fun Bobby	 Hey, sorry I'm late. But my, uh, grandfather, he- died about two\nhours ago. But I-I-I couldn't get a flight out 'til tomorrow, so here I am!"
Joey	 (Approaching) Hey Fun Bobby! Whoah! Who died?'
Fun Bobby	 It's gonna be an open casket, y'know, so at least I'll- I get to see\nhim again."
Janice	 (Ross is still taking their photo) Oh, I'm gonna blow this one up, and\nI'm gonna write 'Reunited' in glitter."
Chandler	 Alright, Janice, that's it! Janice... Janice... Hey, Janice, when I\ninvited you to this party I didn't necessarily think that it meant that we-"
Janice	 Oh, no. Oh, no.'
Chandler	 I'm sorry you misunderstood..."
Janice	 Oh my God. You listen to me, Chandler, you listen to me. One of these\ntimes is just gonna be your last chance with me. (She runs off)'
Chandler	 Oh, will you give me the thing. (Snatches the camera)'
Phoebe	 Hi, Max!'
Max	 Yoko. (To David) I've decided to go to Minsk without you."
David	 Wow.'
Max	 It won't be the same- but it'll still be Minsk. Happy New Year.(Walks off)"
Phoebe	 Are you alright?'
David	 Yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine. "
Phoebe	 You're going to Minsk."
David	 No, I'm... not going to Minsk."
Phoebe	 Oh, you are so going to Minsk. You belong in Minsk. You can't stay here\njust 'cause of me."
David	 Yes I can. Because if I go it means I have to break up with you, and I\ncan't break up with you."
Phoebe	 Oh yes, yes, yes you can. Just say, um, 'Phoebe, my work is my life and\nthat's what I have to do right now'. And I say 'your work?! Your work?! How can you say\nthat?!'. And then you say, um, 'it's tearing me apart, but I have no choice. Can't you\nunderstand that?'. And I say (Hits him) 'no! No! I can't understand that!'."
David	 Uh, ow.'
Phoebe	 Ooh, sorry. Um, and, and then you put your arms around me. And then you\nput your arms around me. (He does so) And, um, and then you tell me that you love me and\nyou'll never forget me."
David	 I'll never forget you."
Phoebe	 And then you say that it's almost midnight and you have to go because\nyou don't wanna start the new year with me if you can't finish it. (They kiss) I'm gonna\nmiss you. You scientist guy."
Dick Clark	 (on TV) Hi, this is Dick Clark, live in Times Square. We're in a\nvirtual snowstorm of confetti here in Times Square..."
Joey	 There y'go, kids."
Chandler	 (To a woman who he has clearly just met) And then the peacock bit me.\n(Laughs) Please kiss me at midnight. (She leaves)'
Joey	 You seen Sandy?'
Chandler	 Ooh. Uh, I don't know how to tell you this, but she's in Monica's\nbedroom, getting it on with Max, that scientist geek. Ooh, look at that, I did know how to\ntell you."
Rachel	 Vrrbddy, the bll is drrbing.'
All	 (in the kitchen) What?'
Rachel	 The bll is drrbing!'
Dick Clark	 (on TV) In twenty seconds it'll be midnight..."
Chandler	 And the moment of joy is upon us.'
Joey	 Looks like that no date pact thing worked out.'
Phoebe	 Everybody looks so happy. I hate that.'
Monica	 Not everybody's happy. Hey Bobby!"
Chandler	 Y'know, I uh.. just thought I'd throw this out here. I'm no math whiz,\nbut I do believe there are three girls and three guys right here. (Makes kiss noise)"
Phoebe	 I dunno. I don't feel like kissing anyone tonight."
Rachel	 I can't kiss anyone."
Monica	 So I'm kissing everyone?"
Joey	 Nonono, you can't kiss Ross, that's your brother."
Ross	 Perfect. Perfect. So now everybody's getting kissed but me."
Chandler	 Alright, somebody kiss me. Somebody kiss me, it's midnight! Somebody\nkiss me!"
Joey	 Alrightalrightalright. (Kisses him. Ross takes a photo) There.'

Ross	 (Watching Marcel and talking to Rachel) I wanted this to work so much. I\nmean I'm still in there, changing his diapers, pickin' his fleas... but he's just phoning\nit in. Just so hard to accept the fact that something you love so much doesn't love you\nback."
Rachel	 ...I think that bitch cracked my tooth.'
