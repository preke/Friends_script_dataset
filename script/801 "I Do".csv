Photographer	 Great. (Takes a picture.) Great! Just give me a sec to change\nfilm.'
Monica	 Okay.'
Ross	 (To Monica) Okay, I know I\xc2\x92m not supposed to know, but I do. And\nI\xc2\x92m so excited for you!'
Joey	 What? What\xc2\x92s going on?'
Ross	 Monica\xc2\x92s pregnant!'
Joey	 Oh my God! Is that why you guys had to get married?!'
Monica	 Guys! I\xc2\x92m not pregnant.'
Joey	 Ah. (To Chandler) Slow swimmers? (Chandler looks at him.)'
Ross	 What?! What do you mean? You-you-you\xc2\x92re not pregnant?'
Monica	 You didn\xc2\x92t tell anybody I was did you?!'
Ross	 No! (Pause) I\xc2\x92ll be right back. (Exits.)'
Photographer	 Now why don\xc2\x92t we get a shot of just Monica and the bloody\nsoldier.'
Monica	 (To Joey) Oh, about that. Joey, you have to change before the party.'
Joey	 I can\xc2\x92t! I-I don\xc2\x92t have any other clothes here.'
Monica	 Find some! Please! Anything that doesn\xc2\x92t say I-I died tragically in\nFrance. (Joey leaves to find clothes.)'
Photographer	 Well then why don\xc2\x92t we see the bride and the groom and the\nbridemaids.'
Phoebe	 Okay. (Phoebe and Rachel join Monica and Chandler on the altar.) Hey\nMon, why did you tell the guys you weren\xc2\x92t pregnant?'
Monica	 Because I\xc2\x92m not.'
Phoebe	 We found your test in the trash, if you\xc2\x92re not pregnant\xc2\x97(She\nsees Rachel shaking her head)\xc2\x97It\xc2\x92s because I am.'
Chandler	 What?! What are you talking about?'
Monica	 What are you talking about?'
Phoebe	 Yes, I\xc2\x85I am with child. (Flash) And I didn\xc2\x92t want to say\nanything because it\xc2\x92s your day; I didn\xc2\x92t want to steal your thunder.'
Monica	 Wait a minute! So you told people I was pregnant?! (Flash) Does this\nlook like a conversation that I want to remember?!'
Chandler	 Who\xc2\x92s the father?'
Monica	 Yeah!'
Phoebe	 I can\xc2\x92t say.'
Monica	 Why?!'
Chandler	 Why not?'
Phoebe	 I can\xc2\x92t say because he\xc2\x92s famous.'
Rachel	 Oh my God, who is it?! (Phoebe rolls her eyes.)'
Monica	 Phoebe, come on, you have to tell us.'
Phoebe	 Okay, okay. It\xc2\x92s James Brolin. James Brolin is the father of my\nbaby.'
Chandler	 As in Barbara Streisand\xc2\x92s husband James Brolin?'
Phoebe	 What?! Well he never said that to me!'

Photographer	 Why don\xc2\x92t we have Monica step away and we\xc2\x92ll get\nChandler and the bridemaids.'
Phoebe	 How about just the bridemaids?'
Chandler	 Y\xc2\x92know I am the groom right? I was told it was kinda big deal.'
Phoebe	 It is.'
Rachel	 For you. (Chandler leaves.)'
Phoebe	 Oh my God!'
Rachel	 Oh, thank you for doing that. I just can\xc2\x92t deal with this just\nquite yet.'
Phoebe	 So instead you told me Monica was pregnant.'
Rachel	 You said that she was, I just didn\xc2\x92t disagree with you.'
Phoebe	 Sneaky.'
Rachel	 Oh yeah.'
Photographer	 Smile ladies.'
Rachel	 Oh! (They smile and the picture is taken.) Oh by the way?'
Phoebe	 Uh-hmm.'
Rachel	 James Brolin?'
Phoebe	 Oh, I know. I could only think of two names, him and Ed Begley Jr. and\nthen I remembered he\xc2\x92s gay.'
Rachel	 Ed Begley Jr. is not gay.'
Phoebe	 (intrigued) Really?!'
Bandleader	 Thank you very much! Ladies and gentlemen, it gives me great\npleasure to introduce to you for the very first time, Mr. and Mrs. Chandler Bing!'
Chandler	 Before we go out there I\xc2\x92ve got a present for ya.'
Monica	 Honey, I\xc2\x92m going to put my hand in your pocket!'
Chandler	 No?'
Monica	 No.'
Chandler	 I\xc2\x92ve been taking dancing lessons.'
Monica	 What?!'
Chandler	 Yeah, the last six weeks. I wanted this to be a moment you will never\nforget.'
Monica	 Oh that is so sweet!'
Chandler	 So? Would you care to join me in our first dance as husband and wife?'
Monica	 Yes.'
Monica	 What\xc2\x92s the matter?'
Chandler	 I don\xc2\x92t know, it\xc2\x92s these new shoes, they\xc2\x92re all\nslippery.'
Monica	 Well, are you going to be able to do this?'
Chandler	 Not well.'
Monica	 Well, the good news is, I don\xc2\x92t think anyone\xc2\x92s looking at us.'
Phoebe	 So, are you ready to talk about it?'
Rachel	 No.'
Phoebe	 Now?'
Rachel	 No!'
Phoebe	 Okay, we\xc2\x92ll talk about something else then.'
Rachel	 Thank you.'
Phoebe	 Who\xc2\x92s the father?!'
Rachel	 Ugh! Look honey y\xc2\x92know what? I haven\xc2\x92t told him yet, so until\nI do I don\xc2\x92t think I should tell anybody else.'
Phoebe	 Yeah. That\xc2\x92s fine. That\xc2\x92s fair. Is it Tag?'
Rachel	 Phoebe!!'
Phoebe	 Okay, I\xc2\x92m sorry. I\xc2\x92ll stop.'
Rachel	 Okay.'
Phoebe	 Is it Ross? It\xc2\x92s Ross isn\xc2\x92t it\xc2\x97Oh my God, it\xc2\x92s Joey!'
Rachel	 Honey, stop it! I am not going to tell you until I tell him.'
Phoebe	 Ah-hah! At least we know it\xc2\x92s a him.'
Monica	 (seeing him) Oh sweet Lord.'
Joey	 I\xc2\x92m sorry! Okay? I went down to the gift shop and it\xc2\x92s either\nthis or a bathrobe! Look, what\xc2\x92s more important, the way I\xc2\x92m dressed or me being\nwith you on your special day?'
Monica	 Honey, I\xc2\x92m not even going to pretend I was listening. (Sees someone\nelse.) Hey! Hey! (Goes over to that person.)'
Ross	 Hi. I\xc2\x92m uh, I\xc2\x92m Ross. I don\xc2\x92t, I don\xc2\x92t believe\nwe\xc2\x92ve met. I\xc2\x92m Monica\xc2\x92s older brother.'
Woman	 Oh hi, I\xc2\x92m, I\xc2\x92m Mona from her restaurant.'
Ross	 Oh! Hello uh, Mona from her restaurant. (He uses his card to mouth those\nwords.) (Pause) Mona, wow what a, what a beautiful name.'
Mona	 You think so? I\xc2\x92ve always kinda hated it.'
Ross	 Aw come on, Mona Lisa?'
Mona	 Uh-huh.'
Ross	 Mona umm\xc2\x85Clickclocken. The famous botanist? Huh? Oh no she\xc2\x92s\nuh\xc2\x97well she\xc2\x92s dead now. No, supposedly she was once quite the hottie of the\nplant world.'
Mona	 Really?! Well see? I never knew about her.'
Ross	 Linda Clickclocken. (Pause) So what uh, what-what table are you at? (She\nshows him.) Oh, uh me too.'
Mona	 Oh good. Now there\xc2\x92ll be someone there who likes my name.'
Ross	 (sexily) Yes there will. (Mona leaves and Ross tries to find the same\ntable.) Oh guess what, Molly Gilbert you\xc2\x92ve just been bumped up to table one. And if\nit\xc2\x92s all right with you I\xc2\x92m gonna take your place at table six\xc2\x97Martin\nClickclocken.'
Joey	 That\xc2\x92s better, now just bend your arms a little more. There you go.\nOkay, look straight ahead. Now this time I want you to really put your ass into it. (They\ndo a practice swing and she really puts her ass into it.)'
Mrs. Bing	 Chandler darling! Look, my date has finally arrived. I\xc2\x92d like\nyou to meet Dennis Phillips.'
Dennis Phillips	 Congratulations.'
Chandler	 Thank you.'
Mrs. Bing	 Dennis is a dear old friend and a fantastic lover.'
Chandler	 Bravo Dennis thanks for pleasing my mother so.'
Dennis Phillips	 Oh, I\xc2\x92m so sorry I missed the ceremony, I was stuck at\nauditions.'
Mrs. Bing	 Oh yes, Dennis is directing a new Broadway show.'
Joey	 I don\xc2\x92t believe we\xc2\x92ve met, Joey Tribbiani.'
Dennis Phillips	 Dennis Phillips'
Joey	 Wow, I\xc2\x92ve admired your work for years. You-you\xc2\x92ve done some\nreally amazing stuff.'
Dennis Phillips	 Oh, thank you. Well if you\xc2\x92ll excuse me, I\xc2\x92m gonna go\nget myself a drink. Be back in a moment. (Walks away.)'
Joey	 Wow Dennis Phillips! That\xc2\x92s great! How did you guys meet?'
Mrs. Bing	 Well, it\xc2\x92s a funny story.'
Chandler	 Funny
Bandleader	 Thank you, thank you very much. If everyone will please take your\nseats, dinner will be served.'
Ross	 Hey! Uh, I thought, I thought you were at table six.'
Mona	 No, nine. (Shows him the card again.)'
Ross	 Oh see, before you uh, when you showed it to me you-you held it that way\n(he turns her hand upside down) which uh, which was misleading. Well I\xc2\x92m\xc2\x85 (He\ngoes at sits down at his new table and the kids stare at him.) Hello.'
Joey	 Chandler. Will you see if your mom can give my resume to Dennis Phillips?\n\xc2\x91Cause if I can get in a Broadway show then I would\xc2\x92ve done it all, film,\ntelevision, and theater. The only think left would be radio, and that\xc2\x92s just for ugly\npeople.'
Chandler	 What size shoes do you wear?'
Joey	 Uh, eleven, eleven and a half.'
Chandler	 Great, because my shoes are giving me a little problem on the dance\nfloor, can I borrow the boots from your costume?'
Joey	 Uh, I don\xc2\x92t even really know where I left those. Sorry.'
Chandler	 (looking at Joey\xc2\x92s feet) Those aren\xc2\x92t eleven and a half.'
Joey	 Okay fine! I\xc2\x92m a seven! All right, I have surprisingly small feet.\nBut the rest of me is good, I\xc2\x92ll show ya!'
Monica	 Can you believe Phoebe got pregnant?!'
Rachel	 Oh y\xc2\x92know what honey? Let\xc2\x92s not talk about that right now?'
Monica	 This is so huge.'
Rachel	 Sure, but come on, as big as your wedding?'
Monica	 Of course not nothing is. Between me and you\xc2\x85'
Rachel	 Yeah.'
Monica	 \xc2\x85in this day and age how dumb do you have to be to get pregnant?'
Rachel	 Hey! Y\xc2\x92know, sometimes you can do everything right, everyone can\nwear everything they\xc2\x92re supposed to wear, and one of those little guys just gets\nthrough!'
Monica	 How?'
Rachel	 I don\xc2\x92t know! Maybe they have tools.'
Monica	 Well I-I talked to and uh, she\xc2\x92s definitely going to have this\nbaby. Y\xc2\x92know, she said she was gonna raise it on her own.'
Rachel	 Well, maybe that\xc2\x92s, maybe that\xc2\x92s really brave.'
Monica	 Maybe. I just hope she realizes how hard it\xc2\x92s gonna be.'
Rachel	 Maybe she hasn\xc2\x92t really thought it through that well.'
Monica	 Well, there\xc2\x92s a lot to think about. I mean, how is she, how is she\ngoing to handle this financially? How is she going to juggle work? Does she realize\nshe\xc2\x92s not going to have a date again for the next eighteen years?'
Rachel	 (starting to cry) I don\xc2\x92t know.'
Monica	 Are you okay?'
Rachel	 Uh-hmm. I\xc2\x92m just thinking about Phoebe; poor knocked up Phoebe.'
Waiter	 Champagne?'
Rachel	 Oh yes! Thank you very much! (She grabs a glass, takes a sip, and\nrealizes what she just did. She then tries to spit the champagne back into the glass\nwithout Monica noticing. It doesn\xc2\x92t work.) Oh that\xc2\x92s-that\xc2\x92s actually how\nthe French drink it.'

Phoebe	 Well, I just got off the phone with my lover, James Brolin\xc2\x85'
Monica	 Oh really?!'
Phoebe	 Yes, and apparently he is married to some singer, but he said he would\nleave her for me. And I said, "James, James Brolin, are you sure?" James Brolin\nsaid\xc2\x85'
Monica	 (interrupting) Rachel\xc2\x92s really the one who\xc2\x92s pregnant.'
Phoebe	 (shocked) What?! (deadpan) Why bother?'
Monica	 How do you feel?'
Rachel	 I don\xc2\x92t know. I don\xc2\x92t know how I feel. This is all happening\nso fast. I have to make all these decisions that I don\xc2\x92t want to make. (Takes another\nsip of champagne and spits it back out) Somebody just take this away from me!!'
Phoebe	 Calm down. Maybe you\xc2\x92re not pregnant.'
Rachel	 What?!'
Phoebe	 When I got pregnant with the triplets, I took that test like three times\njust to make sure.'
Monica	 Yes! Maybe it\xc2\x92s a false positive. Are you sure you peed on the\nstick right?'
Rachel	 How many ways are there to do that?'
Phoebe	 I\xc2\x92m-I\xc2\x92m just saying, don\xc2\x92t freak out until you\xc2\x92re a\nhundred percent sure.'
Rachel	 All right, I\xc2\x92ll-I\xc2\x92ll take it again when I get home.'
Monica	 You-you gotta take it now. Come on, do it as a present to me.'
Rachel	 Okay. Thank you.'
Monica	 Okay.'
Phoebe	 I\xc2\x92ll run out and get you one.'
Rachel	 Oh, you guys are so great.'
Monica	 Oh, wait a minute! Who\xc2\x92s is the father?!'
Phoebe	 Oh no, she won\xc2\x92t tell us.'
Monica	 Oh, come on it\xc2\x92s my wedding! That can be my present.'
Rachel	 Wh\xc2\x97Hey, I just gave you peeing on a stick.'
Phoebe	 See? This is why you register.'
Ross	 It was the chair again! Okay? I\xc2\x92m not doing it! It what\xc2\x97look, I\ndon\xc2\x92t\xc2\x97y\xc2\x92know what\xc2\x97eh-eh\xc2\x85 (He walks away and goes over to Mona.)\nHi.'
Mona	 Hi!'
Ross	 Umm, would you like to dance?'
Mona	 Sure.'
Ross	 Yeah?'
Mona	 Yeah.'
Ross	 Oh great! (They get up to dance and Ross is interrupted by a little girl.)'
Little Girl	 Dr. Geller?'
Ross	 I wasn\xc2\x92t farting! (To Mona) Uh, a little game from our table. (To the\nlittle girl) Yes?'
Little Girl	 Dr. Geller, will you dance with me?'
Ross	 Oh umm, well uh, maybe-maybe later. Right now, I\xc2\x92m about to dance\nwith this lady. '
Little Girl	 Okay. (She drops her head in disappointment and walks away.)'
Mona	 Ohhhh!'
Ross	 Uh, unless! Unless, uh this lady wouldn\xc2\x92t mind letting you go first.'
Mona	 I\xc2\x92d be happy to. (To Ross) You are very sweet.'
Ross	 Yes I-I am. In fact umm hey, why don\xc2\x92t we try it my special way? You\ncan dance on my feet.'
Little Girl	 Sure!'
Ross	 Yeah? Hop on. (They start dancing and Mona sits down.) Is the pretty lady\nlooking?'
Little Girl	 Uh-huh.'
Ross	 Keep dancing.'
Chandler	 And the world will never know.'
Joey	 Hey! Did you talk to Dennis about me yet?'
Chandler	 Yes, I told him how talented you were. I told him all about Days Of\nOur Lives.'
Joey	 No-no! No! No! You don\xc2\x92t tell a Broadway guy that! Now he just thinks\nI\xc2\x92m a soap actor.'
Chandler	 But you\xc2\x92re not just a soap actor. You are a soap actor\nwith freakishly tiny feet.'
Joey	 Hey!'
Little Girl	 Thank you.'
Ross	 No-no, thank you Miranda.'
Little Girl	 Melinda!'
Ross	 All right. (Walks over to Mona.)'
Mona	 How cute was that?'
Ross	 Oh-oh, were you, were you watching?'
Second Girl	 Can I go next?'
Ross	 What? Of course you can! Hop on!'
Mona	 Okay, but I get to hop on after her. (Ross bites the air in response.)'
Ross	 I am so gonna score.'
Second Girl	 What?'
Ross	 I like your bow.'
Joey	 (clinks his glass) I\xc2\x92d like to propose a toast. To Monica and\nChandler, the greatest couple in the world. And my best friends. Now, my when I first\nfound out they were getting married I was, I was a little angry. I was like, (overly\nangry) "Why God? Why? How can you take them away from me?!" But then I thought\nback over all our memories together, some happy memories. (Does a fake laugh.) And-and\nthere was some sad memories. (Starts to break down and cry.) I\xc2\x92m sorry. And-and some\nscared memories\xc2\x97Whoa! (He jumps back, startled.) Eh? And then, and then I realized\nI\xc2\x92ll always be their friend, their friend who can speak in many dialects and has\ntraining in stage combat and is willing to do partial nudity. (Starts to walk away, but\nrealizes something.) Oh! To the happy couple!'
Bandleader	 Thank you.'
Ross	 (to the second girl) That was very nice Ashley.'
Ross	 No-no. (Walks over to Mona again.) '
Mona	 So, is it my turn now?'
Fat Girl	 I\xc2\x92m next!'
Ross	 Oh! (Recoils in horror.)'
Mona	 Uh, that\xc2\x92s okay. You can dance with her first.'
Ross	 Oh, you-you sure? (She nods yes.) Okay. (To the girl) Okay. So what\xc2\x92s\nuh, what\xc2\x92s your name.'
Fat Girl	 Gert!'
Ross	 That\xc2\x92s, that\xc2\x92s pretty. (They start to dance and Gert tries to\nstep on Ross\xc2\x92s feet, but he pulls them out of harm\xc2\x92s way.) Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!\nWhat are you doing there Gert?'
Gert	 Dancing on your feet! Like the other girls did it.'
Ross	 Okay. (Swallows hard.) Hop on Gert. (She does and Ross winces in pain.)'
Gert	 Why aren\xc2\x92t you moving your feet?'
Ross	 I\xc2\x92m trying. (He strains to move his feet.)'
Gert	 Faster! You\xc2\x92re not going fast enough!'
Ross	 Maybe I should stand on your feet! (Gert\xc2\x92s shocked and Ross realizes\nwhat he said and tries to brush it off.)'
Joey	 So did you uh, happen to catch my toast up there?'
Dennis Phillips	 Oh my God, that was for my benefit?'
Joey	 Well, I\xc2\x92d like to think there was something for everyone. Look, I\nknow you\xc2\x92re casting for this new show\xc2\x85'
Dennis Phillips	 Look umm Joey, I-I don\xc2\x92t think you\xc2\x92re quite right for\nthis project.'
Joey	 Oh, see that\xc2\x92s where you\xc2\x92re wrong. Whatever it is I can do it.\nAnd if didn\xc2\x92t see it up there, just-just try me.'
Dennis Phillips	 It\xc2\x92s an all Chinese cast. Can you be Chinese?'
Joey	 Well I\xc2\x92m not proud of this, but\xc2\x85 (He turns around and starts to\nmess with his eyelids.)'
Dennis Phillips	 Oh my God! No-no-no! Please! Please!\nDon\xc2\x92t-don\xc2\x92t-don\xc2\x92t!'
Monica	 Hey, are you ready to get back on the dance floor?'
Chandler	 Did it turn into sand?'
Monica	 Ohh come on, I love this song! Come on, you\xc2\x92ll be fine. (She starts\nto walk towards the floor.)'
Chandler	 (sliding up behind her) No. No, I won\xc2\x92t. Do you know why I took\nall those lessons? See, for the first time I didn\xc2\x92t want you to be embarrassed to be\nseen on the dance floor with some clumsy idiot.'
Monica	 Oh sweetie, you can never embarrass me. (Chandler grunts.) Okay, you can\neasily embarrass me. But come on, it doesn\xc2\x92t matter. All right? I married you! So I\nwant to dance on my wedding night with my husband. Come on. (They go onto the floor.) Just\ntry not to move your feet at all. (Chandler starts to get into the groove and bust a\nmove.) There you go.'
Mr. Geller	 Chandler, I\xc2\x92m gonna have you arrested.'
Chandler	 Why?'
Mr. Geller	 You stole my moves. (He starts to dance like Chandler was and\nChandler stops.)'
Rachel	 How much longer?'
Phoebe	 30 seconds.'
Rachel	 30 seconds, okay.'
Monica	 (entering) Did I miss it? (Phoebe nods no.) Rachel, I-I want you to know\nthat, if it\xc2\x92s positive, we\xc2\x92re gonna\xc2\x85'
Rachel	 Oh I know. I know. (They hug.)'
Phoebe	 It\xc2\x92s time.'
Monica	 Go ahead Rach.'
Rachel	 Oh wait! Y\xc2\x92know what? I can\xc2\x92t, I can\xc2\x92t look at it. I\ncan\xc2\x92t. Somebody else tell me, somebody tell me.'
Phoebe	 Okay.'
Rachel	 Okay.'
Phoebe	 Umm, it\xc2\x92s negative.'
Rachel	 What?'
Phoebe	 It\xc2\x92s negative.'
Rachel	 Oh. Oh. Well there you go. Whew! (Pause) That is\xc2\x97that\xc2\x92s\ngreat\xc2\x97that is really great-great news. (Pause) Y\xc2\x92know \xc2\x91cause the whole not\nbeing ready and kinda the financial aspects, all that. Whew. Wow, this is so just the way\nit was supposed to be. (Starts to cry.) God.'
Monica	 Well\xc2\x85 Well, great.'
Phoebe	 Here. (Gives Rachel a tissue.)'
Rachel	 Thanks. (Crying) God this is so stupid! (Pause) How could I be upset\nover something I never had? It\xc2\x92s negative?'
Phoebe	 No, it\xc2\x92s positive.'
Rachel	 What?!'
Phoebe	 It\xc2\x92s-it\xc2\x92s not negative, it\xc2\x92s positive.'
Rachel	 Are you sure?'
Phoebe	 Well yeah, I lied before.'
Rachel	 Oh!'
Monica	 Oh God\xc2\x85'
Phoebe	 Now you know how you really feel about it.'
Rachel	 Oh-oh, that\xc2\x92s a risky little game!'
Monica	 Are you really gonna do this?'
Rachel	 Yeah. I\xc2\x92m gonna have a baby. I\xc2\x92m gonna have a baby. I\xc2\x92m\ngonna have a baby! (They all hug.)'
Phoebe	 With who?'
Rachel	 Ah, it\xc2\x92s still not the time.'


Ross	 I just didn\xc2\x92t see the fast song coming.'
Joey	 Shh. Shh. Don\xc2\x92t try to talk, we\xc2\x92ll get you up to your room,\nwe\xc2\x92ll soak your feet, you\xc2\x92ll be okay.'
Ross	 Oh, thank you.'
Mona	 That is so sweet!'

Mona	 No, I mean it. There are so few genuinely nice guys out there.'
Joey	 Tell me about it, I feel like I\xc2\x92m holding down the fort all by\nmyself.'
Mona	 It\xc2\x92s Joey right?'
Joey	 Yeah.'
Ross	 Wait a minute! No! I\xc2\x92m the nice one! I\xc2\x92m the one who danced with\nthe kids all night! How\xc2\x85How small are your feet?! (They all look down.)'
