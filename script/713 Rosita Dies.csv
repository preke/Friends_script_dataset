Joey	 Hey.'
Rachel	 Hey.'
Joey	 What are you doing?'
Rachel	 Well, y\xc2\x92know I was thinking of moving the couch over here.'
Joey	 (laughs) Why would you want to do that?'
Rachel	 So that there will be a decent place for me to sit.'
Joey	 Rach, there is a decent place to\xc2\x85'
Rachel	 And your lap does not count! Okay? Come on help me move this.'
Joey	 No. No. No.'
Rachel	 No?'
Joey	 No. Rosita does not move.'
Rachel	 I\xc2\x92m sorry, Rosita? As in\xc2\x85'
Joey	 As in Rosita does not move.'
Rachel	 Joey, it\xc2\x92s just a chair! What\xc2\x92s the big deal?'
Joey	 The big deal is that it is the exact equal distance from the bathroom to\nthe kitchen and it\xc2\x92s at the perfect angle so you don\xc2\x92t get any glare coming of\noff Stevie.'
Rachel	 Stevie the TV?'
Joey	 (glaring at her) Is there a problem?'
Rachel	 No! (Joey sets his beer and bag of chips down and heads into his room.)\nOh what does he know! Come on Rosita, us chichas got to stick together! (She tries pulling\non the back of the chair, until the hinge breaks and the back falls off.) You bitch!'

Ross	 Hey, y\xc2\x92know what\xc2\x92s weird? After you guys get married, when you\nintroduce me to people you\xc2\x92re gonna have to say, "This is my brother-in-law\nRoss." Not, "My friend Ross," "brother-in-law Ross." That\xc2\x92s\nweird isn\xc2\x92t it?'
Chandler	 Couldn\xc2\x92t I just say, "This is Ross?"'
Ross	 (disappointed) Sure, do whatever you want.'
Monica	 (entering, carrying a newspaper) Hey Ross! So, I was checking out the\nuh, real estate section\xc2\x85'
Ross	 Yeah?'
Monica	 Look at this. (Hands him the newspaper.)'
Ross	 Oh, it looks like mom and dad\xc2\x92s house. Oh, it even has a tree with a\nbroken limb out front and the uh, the window in the attic is\xc2\x85Oh my God!!'
Phoebe	 What? What happened to the window in the attic?!'
Monica	 I can\xc2\x92t believe mom and dad are selling the house!'
Ross	 I can\xc2\x92t believe they-they didn\xc2\x92t even tell us!'
Phoebe	 I can\xc2\x92t believe I still don\xc2\x92t know what happened to the window\nin the attic!'
Ross	 (on phone) Uh, hello dad! Monica and I just saw the house in the paper!\n(Listens) Yes we\xc2\x92re surprised! (Listens) Who did you leave a message with?'
Chandler	 (knocking on the window while outside) Sorry! (Runs off.)'
Rachel	 Joey, Joey I am so sorry.'
Joey	 I told you not to move it! Rach, how would you feel if say, I wanted to\nmove you mom, and you said don\xc2\x92t, and I did it anyway and her head fell off?'
Rachel	 Okay, come on\xc2\x97Joey, I\xc2\x92ll buy you a new one! All right?\nWe\xc2\x92ll go down to the store right now and we\xc2\x92ll-we\xc2\x92ll get you a new chair.'
Joey	 (slowly turning and glaring at her) She\xc2\x92s not even cold yet!'
Rachel	 But don\xc2\x92t you think Rosita would\xc2\x92ve wanted you to move on? I\nmean y\xc2\x92know, she did always put\xc2\x85your comfort first.'
Joey	 That\xc2\x92s true.'
Rachel	 (grabbing her coat) Okay? You ready?'
Joey	 Yeah, I\xc2\x85 (Shuts off the TV.) I don\xc2\x92t want Stevie to see her like\nthis.'
Ross	 I can\xc2\x92t believe we have to say goodbye to the house we grew up in.\nMan, some-some stranger\xc2\x92s gonna be living in my room.'
Monica	 Well, after 15 years of mom and dad keeping it as a shrine to you,\nit\xc2\x92s time the velvet ropes came down.'
Ross	 They kept your room for a while.'
Monica	 Oh please! Dad turned my room into a gym 20 minutes after I moved out! I\ngotta say, a tanning bed and a stack of Victoria\xc2\x92s Secret catalogues, not a\ngym!'
Ross	 Come on, you know they love you.'
Monica	 As much as they love you?'
Ross	 I was their first born! They thought she was barren! It\xc2\x92s not my\nfault.'
Phoebe	 (entering) Hey.'
Ross	 Hey.'
Monica	 Hey!'
Phoebe	 Ugh, I hate this year!'
Ross	 What\xc2\x92s wrong with this year?'
Phoebe	 Well okay, it\xc2\x92s already February and I\xc2\x92ve only given two\nmassages and they were both the worst tippers in the world!'
Monica	 That was me and Ross.'
Phoebe	 Oh that\xc2\x92s right!'
Ross	 Hey, y\xc2\x92know if you want to pick up some extra cash? Some friends of\nmine made good money doing telemarketing.'
Monica	 Oh that\xc2\x92s a great idea. You\xc2\x92re really good on the phone.'
Phoebe	 Yeah and yeah, and it would probably be better than the last telephone\njob I had. Y\xc2\x92know, I probably wouldn\xc2\x92t have to say spank as much. (Monica and\nRoss are shocked.) '
Ross	 What?'
Phoebe	 Oh yeah, like you never called!'
Supervisor	 So basically this is very easy. You read from the script and try to\nsell as much toner as you possibly can.'
Phoebe	 Okay, I can do that! Oh, by the way, I love my office.'
Supervisor	 (laughs) Why don\xc2\x92t we do a trial run.'
Phoebe	 Oh okay. Umm, all right. (Picks up the phone and starts reading from the\nscript.) Hi, this is Phoebe from Empire Office Supplies, can I speak to your supply\nmanager please?'
Supervisor	 I\xc2\x92m the supply manager.'
Phoebe	 Umm, okay I would like to talk to you about your toner needs.'
Supervisor	 We don\xc2\x92t need any toner.'
Phoebe	 Oh okay, well I\xc2\x92m sorry to bother you. Bye-bye. (Hangs up the\nphone.) Yeah you\xc2\x92re right, this is easy.'
Supervisor	 Okay, what was wrong with that call?'
Phoebe	 Oh well, all right\xc2\x85um, no offense, but you were kind of rude.'
Supervisor	 They\xc2\x92re always going to tell you they don\xc2\x92t need toner,\nbut that\xc2\x92s okay because whatever they say, you can find the answer to it here in this\nscript.'
Phoebe	 Oh.'
Supervisor	 So, I think you\xc2\x92re ready to sell toner, do you have any last\nquestions?'
Phoebe	 No. (Pause) Oh wait yes! I do, I do have one question. What is toner?'
Chandler	 Joey! Joe! (Sees that he\xc2\x92s not here and starts investigating. He\npicks up the bag of chips.) Full bag. (He picks up the beer.) Beer\xc2\x92s still cold.\nSomething terrible must\xc2\x92ve happened here! (He decides it\xc2\x92s not that\nimportant; sits down on Rosita, and the back falls off causing him to flip over.) Oh\nno-no-no-no-no-no! (Runs over to Stevie.) Stevie, I was never here! (Runs out.)'
Ross	 Dad?'
Mr. Geller	 I\xc2\x92m here!'
Ross	 (entering with Monica) Hey!'
Mr. Geller	 Hi. God, it seems like just yesterday you guys used to come out to\nwatch me work.'
Ross	 Dad, we-we can\xc2\x92t believe you\xc2\x92re selling the house.'
Mr. Geller	 Well, it\xc2\x92s time for a new family to start their memories here\nand hopefully their check will clear before they find the crack in the foundation and the\nasbestos in the ceiling.'
Ross	 (To Monica) Let\xc2\x92s grab our stuff and get the hell out of here.'
Mr. Geller	 I\xc2\x92m sorry we can\xc2\x92t store your childhood things anymore.'
Monica	 Oh, that\xc2\x92s okay, I can\xc2\x92t wait to see everything again! All of\nthe memories\xc2\x85'
Mr. Geller	 Well, I don\xc2\x92t know what\xc2\x92s in the boxes down here, but I do\nknow there are six or seven Easy Bake Ovens in the attic.'
Monica	 I used to love to play restaurant.'
Ross	 Yeah, not as much as you used to love to play uncooked batter eater.'
Monica	 Hey, it is unreasonable to expect a child to wait for a light\nbulb to cook brownies! (She goes to the attic.)'
Mr. Geller	 So, I think you\xc2\x92re boxes are over here. (They walk over to\nthem.)'
Ross	 Wow! Great! (Finds a pack of cigarettes.) Wait, dad who-who\xc2\x92s\ncigarettes are these?'
Mr. Geller	 I don\xc2\x92t know. They-they must be your mother\xc2\x92s, but please,\nplease don\xc2\x92t ask her. I\xc2\x92ll throw these away. (He puts them in his pocket as Ross\nfinds something of interest in one of his boxes.)'
Ross	 Cool! Dad! My report cards! Hey, check this out dad, (reading his grades)\nMath, A. Science, A. History, A. Gym\xc2\x85(He puts it away and finds something else.)\nOooh, my rock polisher!'
Mr. Geller	 Oh look, look there\xc2\x92s your old makeup kit!'
Ross	 It\xc2\x92s a clown kit! Clown kit!'
Mr. Geller	 Well, the white seems to be untouched. (He throws it back into the\nbox as Mr. Geller moves a tarp and makes a discovery.) Uh-oh.'
Ross	 What?'
Mr. Geller	 Y\xc2\x92know how the garage floods every Spring?'
Ross	 How are you ever going to sell this place?'
Mr. Geller	 I think I accidentally used Monica\xc2\x92s boxes to keep the water\naway from the Porsche.'
Ross	 Oh no. Dad! Dad! What\xc2\x85(He goes to open one of her boxes and it rips\napart.) Oh God\xc2\x85everything\xc2\x92s ruined! Dad, she\xc2\x92s gonna be crushed!'
Mr. Geller	 You don\xc2\x92t secretly smoke do you?'
Ross	 No!'
Mr. Geller	 So it\xc2\x92s just your mother then.'
Phoebe	 (on phone) Hi, this Phoebe from Empire Office Supplies, can I speak to\nyour supply manager please? (Listens) Earl, thanks. (Listens) Hi Earl, this is Phoebe from\nEmpire Office Supplies I\xc2\x92d like to talk to you about your toner needs. (She\xc2\x92s\nreading from the script.)'
Earl	 I don\xc2\x92t need any toner.'
Phoebe	 I\xc2\x92m hearing what you\xc2\x92re saying, but at our prices everyone\nneeds toner.'
Earl	 Not me.'
Phoebe	 May I ask why?'
Earl	 You wanna know why. You wanna know why?'
Phoebe	 I surely do!'
Earl	 Okay, I don\xc2\x92t need any toner because I\xc2\x92m going to kill myself.'
Phoebe	 (doesn\xc2\x92t have any luck) Umm, is-is that because you\xc2\x92re out of\ntoner?'

Earl	 Okay, so\xc2\x85no toner today. Thanks anyway, bye-bye.'
Phoebe	 No-no wait-wait! I can\xc2\x92t just let you hang up! Just please talk to\nme.'
Earl	 Well\xc2\x85I only have one thing to do today. (He looks at his board in his\noffice that reads, "Today\xc2\x92s Tasks
Phoebe	 Yeah! Now, why do you want to kill yourself?'
Earl	 It\xc2\x92s just that I uh, have been working for ten years now at this\nmeaningless, dead-end job and nobody here even knows I exist!'
Phoebe	 Chandler?'
Earl	 I-I\xc2\x92m sorry?'
Phoebe	 No look, I-I\xc2\x92m sure that people know you exist!'
Earl	 Oh yeah? I work in a cubicle surrounded by people. I\xc2\x92ve been talking\nto you for five minutes now about killing myself and no one\xc2\x92s even looked up from\ntheir desk. Hang-hang on. (To the people standing around his cubicle.) Hey everybody! Uh,\nI\xc2\x92m gonna kill myself! (There\xc2\x92s no response; no one even looks up.) I\xc2\x92ll\nget back to ya. (To Phoebe) I got nothing. Wait. (He sets the phone down.) Uh, hey Marge!\n(Mimes putting a gun to his head, pulling the trigger, and splattering his brain on the\nwall behind him. Then points to himself. Marge watches this, then goes back to work.) (To\nPhoebe) Ehh, nothing. Nothing.'
Chandler	 My chair. Now, if anybody asks, your name is Rosita! (He runs out the\ndoor, grabs the back of Rosita, and we can hear Joey and Rachel talking as they are coming\nup the stairs. Neither of them have reached the landing yet.)'
Rachel	 You will like it!'
Joey	 No I won\xc2\x92t.'
Rachel	 You don\xc2\x92t even know!'
Joey	 Because, I know what I like and what I don\xc2\x92t like! It\xc2\x92s not the\nsame thing!'
Rachel	 Well look, if you don\xc2\x92t like this\xc2\x85(The audience\xc2\x92s\nlaughter at Chandler\xc2\x92s progress cuts out the rest of Rachel\xc2\x92s line.)'
Joey	 I don\xc2\x92t know why you say that so soon.'
Rachel	 Come on Joey, I just bought you a new chair! The most expensive one in\nthe store! Hey, y\xc2\x92know what I was thinking? We could name her Francette.'
Joey	 Francette? What is she? A couch?'
Joey	 Poor thing. Cut down in her prime.'
Rachel	 Joey, the new chair will be here in an hour. Maybe we should actually\nmove Rosita out of here. Y\xc2\x92know, start the heeling process?'
Joey	 Well, I guess you\xc2\x92re right. Maybe, maybe I\xc2\x92ll take her down to\nthe incinerator. It\xc2\x92s gonna be so said, and kinda cool. (He goes to remove the back,\nbut it doesn\xc2\x92t come off. So he sits down in it, puts his feet up, stands up, and\nlooks back at it.) She\xc2\x92s heeled!'
Rachel	 That\xc2\x92s weird.'
Joey	 No it\xc2\x92s not weird, it\xc2\x92s a miracle!'
Rachel	 It\xc2\x92s not a miracle Joey! I\xc2\x92m sure there\xc2\x92s some\nexplanation.'
Joey	 Oh there is! If you want something enough and your heart is pure, wondrous\nthings can happen!'
Rachel	 Joey, I really don\xc2\x92t\xc2\x85'
Joey	 (interrupting her) Can you tell me how this happened?'
Rachel	 Well no.'
Joey	 Miracle!'
Rachel	 No, y\xc2\x92know what? Maybe somebody came in here and fixed it! Or\nsomething!'
Joey	 Someone like an\xc2\x85angel?'
Rachel	 That\xc2\x92s right Joey, the chair angel came in and heeled your chair.\n(She sits down in the chair.)'
Joey	 (angrily) Get your non-believer ass outta my chair! (She gets up and heads\nfor her room.)'
Mr. Geller	 Well, she\xc2\x92ll understand right? It\xc2\x92s not like I did it on\npurpose.'
Ross	 Dad that won\xc2\x92t matter to her. Look, all my stuff is safe and dry and\nall her is-is, is growing new stuff! See, this is exactly the kind of thing that makes her\nthink you guys love me more than you love her.'
Mr. Geller	 Oh my God, does she really thinks that?'
Ross	 Well, can you blame her?'
Mr. Geller	 Well I don\xc2\x92t know, I-I suppose we may have favored you\nunconsciously, you were a medical marvel! The doctor said your mother could\xc2\x85'
Ross	 Dad, dad I don\xc2\x92t want to hear about it.'
Mr. Geller	 Really?'
Ross	 Well, not right now. Okay look, Monica came here for some memories and\ndamnit, we\xc2\x92re gonna give her some! Okay, grab\xc2\x85grab some empty boxes. Okay?\nWe\xc2\x92ll-we\xc2\x92ll take stuff from mine and whatever we can pass off as hers\nwe\xc2\x92ll-we\xc2\x92ll put \xc2\x91em in their. '
Mr. Geller	 Great!'
Ross	 Like uh y\xc2\x92know like this! This! (He picks up one of those art\nprojects that kids make in kindergarten and first grade.) She-she could\xc2\x92ve made this!'
Mr. Geller	 Sure!'
Ross	 Right? And this! (He picks up a trophy) She-she could\xc2\x92ve won this!'
Mr. Geller	 (grabbing a glove) This could\xc2\x92ve been hers!'
Ross	 Sure! Ooh-ooh, what about this?'
Mr. Geller	 Your make-up kit? I\xc2\x92d feel better.'
Rachel	 (grabbing a beer out of the chair\xc2\x92s fridge) I am so psyched I kept\nthis chair for myself!'
Joey	 Yeah, me too. (He flips up his armrest in disgust.)'
Rachel	 Hey, how\xc2\x92s\xc2\x85how\xc2\x92s the uh, miracle chair?'
Joey	 Fine.'
Rachel	 Yeah? Wow! Y\xc2\x92know, that this thing has speakers in the headrest!'
Joey	 No. Really?'
Rachel	 Yeah! You can hook it up to your TV and you get radio!'
Joey	 (quietly) My chair heels itself.'
Phoebe	 Earl, you\xc2\x92re not hearing me! All I\xc2\x92m saying is that\nyou\xc2\x92re not alone all right? Everybody hates the people they work with! (One of her\ncoworkers overhears that, and she mimes that she didn\xc2\x92t mean him.)'
Guy	 (walking past Earl\xc2\x92s desk) Hey guy!'
Phoebe	 Wait, what was that? That sounded like someone being nice to you.'
Earl	 No! That\xc2\x92s just the "Hey Guy" guy. He says that to\neverybody! He\xc2\x92s the worst! I\xc2\x92d like to take him with me!'
Phoebe	 All right so Earl, let\xc2\x92s just forget about the people at the\noffice, okay? There-there\xc2\x92s gotta be someone else in your life worth sticking around\nfor! What about-what about your family, your friends, or maybe your girlfriend?'
Earl	 (laughs) Yeah! Right!'
Phoebe	 Oh sorry, boyfriend!'
Earl	 Oh no.'
Phoebe	 No, whatever! Anything!'
The "Hey Guy" Guy	 Hey guy!'
Phoebe	 Yeah, he\xc2\x92s gotta go.'
Earl	 Okay, I should, I should probably be getting back to my thing now. See ya.\n(Hangs up.)'
Phoebe	 No! I\xc2\x92m not finished yet! Don\xc2\x92t! Don\xc2\x92t you dare hang up\non me!!!'
Supervisor	 (walking by and overhearing that) (to the rest of the staff) The new\ngirl\xc2\x92s good.'
Monica	 Hey guys! Hey!'
Ross	 Hey.'
Monica	 Hey, I just whipped us up some Easy Bake treats, they should be\nready in about three days.'
Mr. Geller	 (overacting) That\xc2\x92s a good one! Do you hear that Ross? Three\ndays!'
Ross	 (overacting as well) Yeah! Yeah! (Laughs.) Oh, this will make a great\nmemory.'
Monica	 (wary) Okay. So, which boxes are mine?'
Ross	 Well, these. These are yours right here. (Pointing to the boxes they just\ncreated for her.)'
Monica	 Okay. (Starting to go through them) Oh! A coloring book! (Holding it\nup.)'
Ross	 Yeah. Yeah, oh you loved that thing. You always had it with you. You never\nwent anywhere without-without that coloring book.'
Monica	 (looking through it) Really? Wow! It looks like I had some trouble\nstaying inside the lines.'
Ross	 Nu-uh! (Grabs it and examines it.)'
Monica	 (holding up a glove) Oh, an old glove?'
Mr. Geller	 Oh, yeah you loved that glove! You took it every place you went. You\nnever went any place without that glove.'
Monica	 Wow! Look at this! (Picking up a shirt.) I can\xc2\x92t believe I even fit\ninto this shirt! (She holds it up and it reads
Ross	 Oh, I don\xc2\x92t know how that got in there.'
Monica	 (holding up a small cowboy hat) This isn\xc2\x92t mine. (Sets it down and\nlooks at the rest of the boxes.) Hey, this isn\xc2\x92t, this isn\xc2\x92t my stuff! Ugh,\nRoss! (Grabs and holds up a doll.) These are your boxes! Where are my boxes?'
Ross	 Umm, your boxes are umm\xc2\x85'
Monica	 What?'
Ross	 Dad?'
Mr. Geller	 Well, the garage flooded sweetie and it ruined everything in your\nboxes. I\xc2\x92m sorry.'
Monica	 Just mine?'
Mr. Geller	 I\xc2\x92m afraid so.'
Monica	 So why-why wasn\xc2\x92t Ross\xc2\x92s stuff ruined? (Pause) And if you say\nthe words medical marvel I\xc2\x92m going to Easy Bake your head!'
Mr. Geller	 Well, I used your boxes to divert water away from the Porsche.'
Monica	 So wait, Ross\xc2\x92s stuff is fine, but I have no memories because you\nwanted to keep the bottom two inches of your car away from water!!!'
Mr. Geller	 There was also leaves and guk and stuff.'
Monica	 I can\xc2\x92t believe this! (Storms out.)'
Mr. Geller	 (To Ross) Screw it! I\xc2\x92m having one. (Takes out and lights a\ncigarette.)'

Rachel	 Hey Chandler!'
Chandler	 Hey!'
Rachel	 How would you like to sit in a chair that fully reclines, has a rolling\nmassage, and speakers in the head rest?'
Chandler	 Yeah, I\xc2\x92d love to but I\xc2\x92ve tried that so many times they\nwon\xc2\x92t even let me in the store anymore.'
Rachel	 Well what if I told you, you can do it in my apartment?'
Chandler	 (excitedly) Are you telling me that you bought the chair that is\nmaking all other lounge systems obsolete? The chair that Sit magazine called the Chair of\nthe Year?'
Rachel	 I just purchased the La-Z-Boy E-cliner 3000. (Which is an actual\nproduct by the way, I\xc2\x92m not sure about the 3000 part.)'
Chandler	 That\xc2\x92s awesome! That\xc2\x92s great! What made you do it?!'
Rachel	 Well, it\xc2\x92s a long story, but umm I broke Joey\xc2\x92s chair\xc2\x85'
Chandler	 Whoa-whoa-whoa! You broke Joey\xc2\x92s chair?'
Rachel	 Yeah.'
Chandler	 I thought I broke Joey\xc2\x92s chair! That\xc2\x92s why I replaced\nit with mine!'
Rachel	 Ohhhhh. That\xc2\x92s how it got fixed!'
Chandler	 Well, what did you think, that-that elves came in and fixed it?'
Rachel	 Noo! (Laughs) Angels.'
Chandler	 I\xc2\x92m gettin\xc2\x92 my chair back! (Heads for Joey and\nRachel\xc2\x92s.)'
Rachel	 What? Wh-hey!'
Joey	 Well, it looks like it wasn\xc2\x92t heeled after all! Yeah! So, I guess\nthis chair is mine now! (Sits down in it and groans.)'
Chandler	 Joey you broke my chair!!'
Joey	 Your chair?!'
Rachel	 Yeah, he thought he broke your chair so he switched the chairs!'
Joey	 So, there was no miracle?!'
Rachel	 No Joe, no miracle.'
Joey	 (sarcastic) Oh no this is devastating! My faith is shaken. I\xc2\x92m so\nglad I have the new chair to get my through this difficult time in my life.'
Rachel	 Uh-huh! Nice try, but you don\xc2\x92t get that chair anymore! All right?\nThat is my chair now! You can sit on my lap! (Joey starts to get up.) No I take that back!'
Chandler	 I think I should get the chair!'
Joey	 How do you figure?'
Chandler	 Because you (Points to Joey) broke a chair and you (Points to\nRachel) broke a chair! The only one around here that hasn\xc2\x92t broke a chair, is me!'
Rachel	 No-no-no! This chair\xc2\x92s not going anywhere.'
Chandler	 Well, where\xc2\x92s the logic in that?!'
Rachel	 The logic is, that there are two of us and we are both strong enough to\nbreak a chair in half!'
Chandler	 So Joey breaks my chair and I get nothing!'
Joey	 That\xc2\x92s right!'
Chandler	 What are you guys? Like a gang or something?!'
Joey	 Yeah! We are!'
Rachel	 We\xc2\x92re the Cobras!'
Phoebe	 (to Marge) Excuse me! Can you tell me where I can find Earl? He\xc2\x92s\nthe supply manager around here.'
Marge	 Sorry, I don\xc2\x92t know any Earl.'
Earl	 (screaming) I\xc2\x92m right here!!!!'
Phoebe	 (goes over to his desk) Earl! I\xc2\x92m Phoebe.'
Earl	 Phoebe? The lady who sells toner?'
Phoebe	 Umm, look it, you-you can\xc2\x92t kill yourself.'
Earl	 (exhales) Look, um I really appreciate your coming down\xc2\x85'
Phoebe	 No-no I can\xc2\x92t! I can\xc2\x92t let you do it!'
Earl	 Why?!'
Phoebe	 Because it was fate that made me call you today!'
Earl	 I thought it was toner.'
Phoebe	 No! Think about it okay? This isn\xc2\x92t even my regular job!\nOkay? And my first day on the job, you\xc2\x92re my first call! And-and somebody else\nmight\xc2\x92ve hung up on you, but I wouldn\xc2\x92t do that because I know about this stuff.\nMy mom killed herself.'
Earl	 Really?!'
Phoebe	 Yes.'
Earl	 How?'
Phoebe	 I\xc2\x92m not gonna give you tips! Look don\xc2\x92t you see that\nthis-this\xc2\x85this all came together so that I could stop you from doing this.'
Earl	 Couldn\xc2\x92t it just be a coincidence?'
Phoebe	 No, it\xc2\x92s fate!'
Earl	 It doesn\xc2\x92t really seem like enough to be fate.'
Phoebe	 Oh. Well umm, okay here\xc2\x92s a weird thing. My mother was also a\nsupply manager.'
Earl	 I\xc2\x92m actually the office manager.'
Phoebe	 Oh my God! So was she! And! Get this, okay? Your-your name is Earl,\nright? Her name was Pearl, P-Earl.'
Earl	 Well, was there anything else?!'
Phoebe	 Sure! (Thinks.) Umm, where are you from?'
Earl	 Philadelphia.'
Phoebe	 Oh my God! So was she! Oh, I\xc2\x92ve got-I\xc2\x92ve got goose bumps. (She\nholds out her arm.)'
Earl	 (inspecting it) Really?'
Phoebe	 Well, y\xc2\x92know I\xc2\x92m wearing layers and it\xc2\x92s warm.'
Earl	 Yeah-yeah.'
Phoebe	 But if\xc2\x97no look, okay. These jerks might not care about you, but the\nuniverse does! And that says a lot!'
Earl	 (To All) Did you hear that?! I don\xc2\x92t need you guys to care about me!\nBecause the universe cares! The whole universe! (Laughs as everyone ignores him.) (To\nPhoebe) I really wished they\xc2\x92d care just a little bit though.'
Phoebe	 Y\xc2\x92know, I don\xc2\x92t-I don\xc2\x92t think it\xc2\x92s you. This is a\nfreaky place. (To All) Hey! Guys! (Everyone looks up.) (To Earl) Oh no, it\xc2\x92s you.'
Earl	 Yeah.'
Monica	 Oh, this terrible! Everything is destroyed! Look at this. (She\npicks up some kind of furry thing.) It obviously meant enough for me to save it, and I\ndon\xc2\x92t even know what it is! Ohh, it\xc2\x92s still soft. (She rubs it against her\ncheek.) What do you think this is?'
Ross	 All right. I think it was a mouse.'
Mr. Geller	 (entering) How are you honey?'
Monica	 How do you think I am?! You\xc2\x92ve wrecked all my childhood memories.\nYou love Ross more than me. And I just rubbed a dead mouse on my face!'
Mr. Geller	 Sweetheart, we love you just as much as Ross! Now, I\xc2\x92m sorry\nabout everything that happened and I\xc2\x92d probably never be able to make it up to you,\nbut here\xc2\x92s a start. (He hands her a small box.)'
Monica	 (opening it) What\xc2\x92s this?'
Mr. Geller	 It\xc2\x92s the key to my Porsche. Well, the key to your Porsche.'
Monica	 (shocked) What?!'
Ross	 (even more shocked) What?!!!'
Mr. Geller	 I\xc2\x92ve been thinking about getting rid of it. I was driving it\nthe other day and saw my reflection in a store window. Your mother\xc2\x92s right, I do\nlook like an ass.'
Monica	 Wait, you\xc2\x92re giving me your Porsche, you\xc2\x92re kidding me\nright?!'
Ross	 Well w-w-w-w-wait, w-wait, wait, wait a minute! I mean a couple of stupid\nboxes get wet and she gets a Porsche?!'
Mr. Geller	 (To Monica) Why don\xc2\x92t we take it for a spin?'
Monica	 All right!'
Ross	 Well, what about me?! I\xc2\x92m a medical marvel!!'

Joey	 Oh yeah.'

Joey	 Ahhh\xc2\x85\xc2\x85 (To Rachel) Eh?'
Rachel	 Uh-huh.'
Monica	 (entering) Hey guys!'
Rachel	 Hey!'

Monica	 Do you guys know what happened to Chandler\xc2\x92s barca lounger?'
Rachel	 Oh yeah, Joey broke it. Had to get rid of it.'
