Chandler	 Are you looking at naked tribe's women?"
Joey	 No, look. (Shows him the magazine.)'
Chandler	 That's a pig."
Joey	 I know, I know, but look at the knobs on her.'
Chandler	 Hey! (Joey quickly hides the magazine under the couch.)'
Ross	 Emily's cousin kicked me out!"
Chandler	 What?! '
Joey	 Why?'
Ross	 Well, when you're subletting an apartment from your wife's cousin and then\nyou get a divorce, sometimes the cousin suddenly wants his apartment back."
Chandler	 How can he do that? Didn't you sign a lease?"
Ross	 Who needs a lease when it's family!"
Joey	 Hey, you can stay with us! We'll take care of ya!"
Chandler	 Oh, yeah! Absolutely! Anything you need man! But you have to promise\nme the second you are feeling better so that we can make fun of your hair!'
Joey	 Yeah.'
Ross	 You got it.'
Joey	 Okay.'
Ross	 Thanks you guys, I really appreciate this. All right, I'm gonna get\npacking again. Man, I've been moving around so much I'm beginning to feel like a nomad."
Ross	 What?'
Chandler	 He thought you said gonad.'

Monica	 Oh, Larry.'
Phoebe	 Umm, do health inspectors work on commission? '
Larry	 No, bribes.'
Phoebe	 It's okay to laugh right?"
Larry	 Yeah, I was just kidding.'
Phoebe	 Okay. (She laughs harder.)'
Larry	 I'll check the kitchen floors."
Monica	 Okay, knock yourself out, Larry.'
Phoebe	 Yum-my!'
Monica	 Larry?'
Phoebe	 Oh yeah! I'd let him check out my kitchen floors."
Larry	 (entering) A 98. I deducted 2 points because you are not wearing your\nchef's hat, and that is a Section 5 violation."
Monica	 Uh, look, Larry honey, umm, I wrote the book on Section 5 and I know\nthat you don't have to wear your hat unless you're in the kitchen."
Larry	 And where is your hat?'
Monica	 It's in the kitchen, I'll go get it. "
Larry	 Ahh that's the 2 points."
Phoebe	 Hey, you should really read that book you wrote. (To Larry) Wow! You saw\nthe hat in the kitchen and knew that she'd have to go in there hatless to get it.\nYou can have your own health inspector detective show!"
Larry	 Oh, I don't know about that."
Phoebe	 Yeah, but then I can be you sidekick Vunda.'
Larry	 Maybe uh, Vunda could give me her number and I can ask her to dinner\nsometime.'
Phoebe	 Okay, she would love that! Y'know, 'cause you know all the clean places\nto eat."
Larry	 I-I'll call ya."
Phoebe	 Okay.'
Phoebe	 He's so funny! (She imitates what he just did.)"
Monica	 Thanks.'
Rachel	 Thank you. (To Monica) Mon?'
Monica	 Hmm?'
Rachel	 How's Ross doing? Y'know since all the Emily stuff."
Monica	 He's not great umm, but he's dealing with it. Oh wait a minute, you're\nnot gonna try\xc2\x85"
Rachel	 Oh, honey, please, no, I can't get started with all that Ross stuff\nagain. I mean, he's gonna screwed up for a looong time. And besides y'know, I don't, I\ndon't go for guys right after they get divorced."
Monica	 Right, you only go for them 5 minutes before they get married.'
Danny	 (To Gunther) Two pounds of Moca Java please.'
Monica	 (To Monica) Danny. Are you guys ever gonna go out again?'
Rachel	 I don't know! He hasn't called me since that one time when we went out.\nI see him in the hallway, we flirt, I'm all ha-ha-ha-ha, and nothing."
Danny	 (To them) Hey!'
Rachel	 Hi Danny! (Notices his box of liquor he's carrying.) Wow! Thirsty huh?"
Danny	 Uh, actually, actually, I'm having a party at my place on Saturday, it's\nsort of a house warming kind of thing."
Monica	 Ohh, fun!'
Rachel	 Ohh, great!'
Danny	 Yeah, I'm really looking forward to it."
Rachel	 Yeah.'
Danny	 Okay, see ya. (Heads out.)'
Monica	 Well, I guess we won't be warming his house."
Rachel	 (laughs) Okay. All right, I see what he's doing! He's not asking me out,\nbecause he wants me to ask him out."
Monica	 And you're not gonna do that."
Rachel	 That's right! 'Cause that would give him the control! So now he's\nall ooh, coming up with this whole I've got a party thing y'know, trying to get me to hint\naround for an invitation. Blew up in his face, didn't it?"
Monica	 So-so there is no party.'
Rachel	 No, there's a party. There's a party. But the power, that is still up\nfor grabs. You follow me?"
Monica	 I think so. Se, he-he's not inviting you to his party because he likes\nyou."
Rachel	 Exactly.'
Joey	 Ross?'
Ross	 (entering from the bathroom) Hey roomies!'
Chandler	 Love what you've done with the place."
Ross	 Oh, yeah I know, I know, it's a lot of boxes, but again I really\nappreciate you guys letting me stay here."
Joey	 Not a problem. And listen, hey! Since you're gonna be here for a while,\nwhy don't\xc2\x97I was thinking we uh, put your name on the answering machine."
Chandler	 Oh yeah!'
Ross	 Oh, I uh, hope you don't mind, I kinda uh, jazzed it up a little. Check\nthis out. (He plays the greeting, and We Will Rock You starts to play and Ross's\nvoice comes over it.) We will, we will, call you back!"
Joey	 Hey, all right!'
Ross	 Pretty cool, huh?'
Joey	 (To Chandler) You're fake laughing too, right?"
Chandler	 Oh, the tears are real.'
Larry	 You look beautiful this evening.'
Phoebe	 (smiles) Show me the badge again.'
Phoebe	 Shiny. '
Larry	 Oh, will you mind if I wash up? Because I came straight from work and who\nknows where these babies (Holds up his hands) have been.'
Phoebe	 (laughing) You are just nonstop!'
Larry	 (coming back) We're outta here!"
Phoebe	 Why?!'
Larry	 Just walking past the kitchen I saw 10 violations! I'm shutting this\nplace down!"
Phoebe	 (awed) You have the power to do that?'
Larry	 This does. (Shows her his badge.)'
Phoebe	 (excited) Shut it down.'
Joey	 Hey.'
Chandler	 What are you doing?'
Joey	 Nothing.'
Chandler	 You built a fort didn't ya?"
Joey	 (smiles) Kinda.'
Chandler	 (notices something) Oh my God, the air purifier! Ross's air purifier!\nAll I heard through 4 years of college was (makes a humming noise.)"
Joey	 Dude, you should've gone out once and a while."
Chandler	 I hate this thing!'
Joey	 Come on, Chandler, Ross is our friend. He needs us right now, so why don't\nyou be a grown up and come and watch some TV in the fort!"
Rachel	 Oh, hi Danny.'
Danny	 Hey guys, I just uh, wanted to invite you to the party tomorrow night.'
Monica	 Oh, thanks! We'll try to stop by."
Rachel	 Uh, actually, I think I'm gonna be busy."
Monica	 You are?'
Rachel	 Yeah! Remember I got that uh, gala.'
Danny	 Yeah, what's the gala for?"
Rachel	 It's a uh, regatta gala."
Danny	 Really! You-you sail?'
Rachel	 No-no, but I support it.'
Danny	 Okay, (To Monica) hope I see you tomorrow night.'
Monica	 Okay.'
Danny	 Take care. (Leaves.)'
Rachel	 Okay. (Closes the door.) Walked right into that one didn't he?"
Monica	 What one? You wanted him to invite you to the party and he did it!'
Rachel	 Yeah, but he waited until the last minute! So if I said yes, he would\nknow I had nothing better to do than wait around for an invitation to his stupid party. I\nsaid, "No!" Which puts me right back in the driver seat.'
Monica	 Great. So the ball is in his court?'
Rachel	 Ball? There is no ball.'
Ross	 (glaring at him) Joey, please! (Motions to his computer.)'
Joey	 Sorry.'
Joey	 Ahhhhhhhhhh\xc2\x85 '
Chandler	 (entering) Hello children!'
Joey	 Hey! Wanna play some foosball? Please?'
Chandler	 Okay. (Starts to head for where the foosball table usually is.)'
Joey	 No-no, no! We have to move the table into my room, yeah! 'Cause of all the\nboxes. Come on!"
Joey	 All right, I have one question. What is the deal with this?\n(Imitates Ross's 'quiet down' maneuver, but does move his hands up and down he just flaps\nhis hands as if he's waving good-bye.)"
Chandler	 Bye-bye little puppet Joey hand?'
Joey	 No, the quiet down thing!'
Chandler	 You mean this. (Does the maneuver perfectly.)'
Joey	 Um-hmm! Look, I-I-I don't know how much more of this I can take! Did you\nknow he taped over my Baywatch tape with some show about bugs! My God! What if that\nhad been porn?"
Chandler	 (gasps) All right look, y'know, this maybe tough but come on, this is\nRoss! I survived college with him!"
Joey	 All right, I guess I can hold out a little longer. Let's have a game."
Chandler	 Okay.'
Chandler	 No-no-no-no!'
Joey	 YES!!'
Ross	 (entering) Uh fellas, (Does the maneuver and gives them a double thumbs\nup, which Chandler returns as he closes the door.)'
Chandler	 Okay, so he's out of here."
Joey	 Um-hmm.'

Joey	 (entering) Hey!'
Monica	 Hey!'
Joey	 You guys got anything to eat? I just went down to Johnos for some chicken\nand it was closed!'
Phoebe	 Oh, I took Larry there to eat but it was all violated. So we shut it\ndown!'
Joey	 Pheebs, if this guy keeps closing down all of our favorite places, where\nare we gonna eat?!'
Monica	 I don't know, clean places?"
Joey	 Umm, yum!'
Monica	 (looking through the peephole) It's Danny."
Rachel	 Don't let him in! I'm supposed to be at a regatta gala."
Monica	 (to Danny) We'll be right there! (To Rachel) Can't you just say it\nstarts later?"
Rachel	 What? What kind of a regatta gala starts at night?!'
Monica	 The fake kind! '
Danny	 Hey, hi, I need a ladle. You got a ladle?'
Monica	 We have a ladle. (Gives him one.)'
Danny	 Thanks, see you at the party.'
Monica	 Okay, great! '
Phoebe	 Hey, guys, you know what Larry would say? He would say, "See you\nladle." (Laughs.)'
Chandler	 Well, I-I-I'm done with this. You want anything Ross? Sports?\nInternational? Apartment listings?"
Ross	 I'll take sports."
Joey	 Mine! (He grabs it.)'
Ross	 All right. Uhh, international.'
Joey	 Oh that's mine too! (Grabs it and Ross looks at him.) I'm Italian!"
Ross	 Well, I guess I can check out those apartment listings, even though\nthere's never anything in here."
Chandler	 Not even on page 7?'
Ross	 (looks) Oh yeah! You're\xc2\x97hey, you're right! Here's an affordable\nplace, (reading ad) two bedroom, close to work, ooh, it's available in five weeks!"
Chandler	 What about that circled one?'
Ross	 Oh, I-I don't know, it's kind of expensive for a studio."
Joey	 But it's available now! Isn't it?"
Chandler	 Yes, it is.'
Joey	 Hey, let's go look at it! (They both jump up.)"
Ross	 Okay, let's go."
Joey	 Okay!'
Chandler	 There we go!'
Ross	 Oh-oh-ooh, hey guys, I was wondering if you guys would uh, maybe chip in\non some new air filters for the air purifier? I mean after all, we all are using it.'
Chandler	 Let's go quicker."
Joey	 Yeah!'
Ross	 Oh my God! (Looking around, which doesn't take him long.)"
Chandler	 Yeah, well look at this kitchen, slash bathroom. Well that's great!\nY'know so you can cook while in the tub."
Joey	 Somebody was using his head. Hey, let's check out the rest of the place."
Ross	 I think this is it. I don't know, maybe we should keep looking."
Joey	 But hey, Ross, this place is available now!'
Chandler	 Yeah, you don't want to be stuck with us for the next five weeks."
Joey	 Yeah.'
Ross	 (To Joey) So, you-you think I should go ahead and take this place?'
Joey	 Oh, it's perfect!"
Ross	 (To Chandler) How about you?'
Chandler	 It's a kitchen slash bathroom."
Ross	 All right, I see what you guys are saying. I'll uh, I'll go downstairs and\nfill out an application."
Chandler	 We are bad people.'
Joey	 He knew we were trying to get rid of him. He knew! (Pause.) You think we\ncould get a bathtub in our kitchen?'
Larry	 (entering) Hey, ready for dinner?'
Phoebe	 Ooh, absolutely!'
Larry	 Great! How about you wanted to go the Italian place down on Bleaker\nStreet right?'
Phoebe	 Ooh, I love that place! (Thinks about it.) So, no.'
Larry	 How about Mama Lisettie's?"
Phoebe	 Enh. Sure!'
Larry	 (notices something) I wonder how long that milk (on the counter) has been\nsetting out.'
Phoebe	 Oh, no-no, this place is totally healthy! That\xc2\x97this milk is mine. I\nbought this today, 'cause I was thirsty for milk, y'know. (She takes a swig of it, but has\nto turn away from him as she makes a face to show that it has gone bad.) Okay, let's go!"
Larry	 Hey, buddy! (Flashes his badge.) Are you familiar with Section 11-B of\nthe Health Code that requires all refuse material out the back exit?'
Gunther	 But then I'd have to go all the way around the dry cleaner place."
Larry	 Oh, so you're saying you'd choose convenience over health?!"
Phoebe	 Okay, stop! Larry, okay, can't you just be Larry and not Larry the\nhealth inspector guy? Y'know I mean it was really exciting at first but now it's like,\nokay, so where are we gonna eat ever?"
Larry	 Well, I suppose I could give him a warning.'
Phoebe	 Thank you. (To Gunther, who's standing there frozen) Okay, go! Go! Go!\n(He runs off.) (To Larry) Now, if after dinner you still really need to bust someone, I\nknow a hot dog vendor who picks his nose."
Joey	 Maybe, maybe we did a good thing, helping Ross get back on his feet!'
Chandler	 Yes that was a nice place!'
Joey	 Yeah!'
Chandler	 Not a lot of closet space, but he can just hang his stuff out the\nwindow in a bag!'
Joey	 Yeah!'
Chandler	 What are we gonna do?'
Joey	 I don't know. Maybe pizza?"
Chandler	 About Ross!'
Joey	 Oh! Oh!'
Joey	 Hello! (Listens.) Oh yeah! (To Chandler) It's the apartment manager; Ross\nput us down as references. (To the apartment manager.) Ross is the greatest guy you'll\never meet! Yeah, he's very reliable."
Chandler	 (grabbing the phone) Of course he has this big huge dog! That uh,\nbarks into the night. (Listens.) Well, who doesn't love dogs? (Thinks.) Ah, he's a tap\ndancer! (Listens.) Yes, some would say that is a lost art. (Thinks.) He's a pimp!\n(Listens.) There you go! Yes, he's a pimp. He's a big, tap dancing pimp! (Pause.) Hello? "
Chandler	 Ohhhhh!'
Rachel	 Shoot, shoot, this is never gonna work! He's right there!"
Monica	 Just go over and say hi.'
Rachel	 No, I have to go downstairs and come back up as if I'm coming home from\nthe regatta gala. Okay? So just go distract him. But don't be sexy."
Monica	 Hey, Danny!'
Danny	 Hey! What's going on?"
Monica	 (turns his back to the stairs) Oh, it's a great party! Great food.\nY'know, most parties it's all chips and salsa, chips and salsa. (As she's saying this\nRachel tries to head downstairs but is blocked by people coming upstairs. She quickly\nretreats back up the stairs.) (Sees that she has to keep him distracted longer.) So umm,\nwhat's this? (Points to his plate.)"
Danny	 Salad.'
Monica	 Ooooh! (Rachel now succeeds in getting downstairs.) And-and-and\nwhat-what's this? (Points again.)"
Danny	 Bread. Aren't you a chef?"
Monica	 (upon seeing Rachel she points) Oh.'
Danny	 Hey! Rachel!'
Rachel	 Hey! Oh right, tonight was your party.'
Danny	 Oh wow, you look great! Glad you could make it.'
Rachel	 Oh well, y'know, the gala had to end sometime."
Danny	 Don't go anywhere, I'll be right back. (He heads off.)"
Rachel	 Yeah, sure. (To Monica) All right, whose court is the ball in now?'
Monica	 I thought there wasn't a ball?"
Rachel	 Oh, come on! He's glad that I came, he doesn't want me to go anywhere,\nballs flying all over the place!"
Danny	 (returning, with a friend) Rachel, this is my friend Tom. (To Tom) This\nis the girl I told you about.'
Rachel	 Oh, go on! You telling people about me?'
Danny	 You two could really hit it off! I'm gonna go mingle. (Leaves.)"
Tom	 So you work at Bloomingdale's, huh? My mom calls it Bloomies."
Rachel	 (laughs) Yeah, okay, at ease solider!'
Tom	 I'm sorry?"
Rachel	 No, it's all right, you can just drop the act Tommy. I know what's going\non here. Your Danny's wingman right? You guys are best buds. Frat bros!"
Tom	 I'm gonna go talk to uh, a friend."
Rachel	 Yeah, yeah, you go talk to your friend. You tell him, "Nice\ntry."'
Rachel	 Man! He just keeps lobbing them up and I just keep knocking them right\nout of the park!'
Monica	 I think I need a drink.'
Rachel	 Yeah!'
Chandler	 98. 99. 100. Okay, go!'
Joey	 (getting up) Dude, I'm telling ya! I'm fine! (He tries to take a step and\nfalls flat on his face.)"
Chandler	 Here we go! Here we go!'
Joey	 Hey!'
Chandler	 Hey!'
Ross	 Hey. So I uh, I didn't get that apartment. Some problem with my\napplication."
Joey	 You're kidding!"
Chandler	 You're kidding, no!"
Ross	 Yeah. But, the good news is that Phoebe said that I could stay at her\nplace for a while. So\xc2\x85'
Joey	 But you can't stay with Phoebe, Ross! We're-we're roomies! "
Ross	 Look, you guys don't need me here taking up your space."
Joey	 Well, we got plenty of space! There-there's still some over there (Points\nto where the window is but sees that there isn't any space there and points towards his\ndoor.) by-by that speaker. Please, just stay!"
Chandler	 Yeah!'
Ross	 Are you guys sure about this?'
Joey	 Definitely!'
Chandler	 Yes! Ross, you have to stay!'
Ross	 All right.'
Joey	 All right!'
Chandler	 All right, buddy!'
Ross	 So I'm a pimp huh? It's okay! Look, I know that sometimes I can be a pain\nin the ass, but you just have to talk to me. Tell me if something is bothering you. Okay?\nAnd for my part I will do everything I can to keep my annoying habits just (Does the\n'quiet down' maneuver)."

Chandler	 Well, I see you've had a very productive day. Don't you think the\ncowboy hat is a little much?"
Ross	 (popping up behind Joey wearing an Indian headdress) Come on, it's fun!"
Chandler	 All right! (He joins them in the fort and comes up putting on a\nbonnet.) Isn't this a woman's hat?"
Joey	 Dude, stop talking crazy and make us some tea!'
