Chandler	 Our eyes are closed and we\xc2\x92re about to cross the street. Very\ngood.'

Phoebe	 Yeah, it\xc2\x92s for our catering business!'
Joey	 I think I know that girl.'
Monica	 All right, umm, we\xc2\x92re not gonna really keep it this way though.'
Rachel	 No?'
Phoebe	 No, we\xc2\x92re gonna paint over the sword, and replace it with a\nbaguette. '
Rachel	 Oh!'
Phoebe	 And also, we don\xc2\x92t know what to do with this. (She turns on a\nswitch and the girl\xc2\x92s nipples light up.)'
Joey	 Oh yeah, I definitely know her.'

Monica	 (to Phoebe) Remember that guy from cooking school I told you about that\nput cilantro with everything?'
Phoebe	 Oh sure, Cilantro Larry.'
Monica	 Well, I\xc2\x92m gonna fill in for him as food critic for the Chelsea\nReporter.'
Monica	 Wow, Monica! What an amazing opportunity to influence\xc2\x85 dozens of\npeople.'
Phoebe	 How could you say yes, what about our catering business?'
Monica	 Oh no-no-no, it\xc2\x92s only one night a week, and plus I get to take all\nof you out for a lot of free dinners.'
All	 Yay!!'
Phoebe	 Oh, in that case\xc2\x97(hops up and down in joy)\xc2\x97Yay! (Monica looks\nconfused) That was me hopping on board.'
Monica	 Oh.'
Chandler	 (entering) Hey, you guys! Hey, Ross, quick question for ya. Are you\nready to party?'
Ross	 I don\xc2\x92t know, I could maybe go out for a couple of beers, but\nthere\xc2\x92s this thing about bumblebees on The Discovery Channel that I was\nplanning to watch.'
Chandler	 No-no, I don\xc2\x92t think you heard me. Are you ready to party?!'
Ross	 Nooo!! Gandolf?! Gandolf is coming to town?'
Chandler	 Kathy\xc2\x92s with her parents, I have nothing to do, so tomorrow we\nare partying with Gandolf dude!'

Ross	 I\xc2\x92m gonna call after you!'
Chandler	 This is gonna be soo cool, dude, we never party anymore!'
Chandler and Ross	 Woooo!!!'
Monica	 All right, were you guys smoking something in the back of our van?'
Joey	 Really. And what do you mean you never have fun anymore? You have fun with\nme, remember that time we saw those strippers and you paid me 50 bucks to eat that book?'
Ross	 Joey, you are gonna love this guy. Gandolf is like the party wizard!'
Joey	 Well, why do you call him Gandolf?'
Ross	 Gandolf the wizard. (Joey is still confused) Hello! Didn\xc2\x92t you read Lord\nof the Rings in high school?'
Joey	 No, I had sex in high school.'
Rachel	 Oh, uh, Joanna I was wondering if I could ask you something.\nThere\xc2\x92s an opening for an assistant buyer in Junior Miss\xc2\x85'
Joanna	 (interrupting) Okay, but that would actually be a big step down for me.'
Rachel	 Well, actually, I meant for me. The hiring committee is meeting people\nall day and\xc2\x85'
Joanna	 Oh. Well, I wish I could say no, but you can\xc2\x92t stay my assistant\nforever. Neither can you Sophie, but for different reasons.'
Rachel	 God, I am so glad you don\xc2\x92t have a problem with this, because if\nyou did, I wouldn\xc2\x92t even consider applying.'
Joanna	 Really? Well, in that case\xc2\x85'
Rachel	 (interrupting) And that\xc2\x92s I\xc2\x92m so glad\xc2\x85 there\xc2\x92s no\nproblem.'
Joanna	 That\xc2\x92s fine, actually I\xc2\x92m on the hiring committee, so\nthere\xc2\x92ll be at least one friendly face.'
Rachel	 Ohh! That\xc2\x92s great!'
Joanna	 You know, Junior Miss is where I started. Oh, I had to sleep with the ugliest\nguy to get that job.'
Rachel	 Really?!'
Joanna	 No-ho-ho! (pause) Yeah. (pause) I mean, no-no-no-no-no, don\xc2\x92t you\nworry, I\xc2\x92m sure with your qualifications you won\xc2\x92t need to sleep with some guy\nto get that job. Although, I might need some convincing.'
Rachel	 Well, I, umm\xc2\x85'
Joanna	 Kidding! God, I feel wild today!'
Chandler	 Oh man! I am so excited\xc2\x97I may vomit!'
Joey	 Will you calm down, he\xc2\x92s just a human guy.'
Chandler	 Look you don\xc2\x92t understand, Gandolf is amazing. Y\xc2\x92know\nyou\xc2\x92re never know what\xc2\x92s gonna end up happening, you go out for a couple of\nbeers and end up on a fishing boat to Nova Scotia! '
Joey	 Really?!'
Chandler	 Oh yeah, it\xc2\x92s beautiful country up there.'
Ross	 (entering) Hey! Okay! I got my passport, fresh socks, and a snake bite\nkit!'
Chandler	 It\xc2\x92s not gonna be exactly like last time.'
Joey	 All right, I\xc2\x92ll see you guys.'
Chandler and Ross	 Whoa-whoa-whoa!'
Chandler	 Whoa-wh-wh-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa!'
Joey	 I have an audition, but I\xc2\x92ll definitely hook up with you later. Where\nare you gonna be around noon?'
Ross	 Somewhere maybe along the equator?'
Joey	 Okay. (leaves as the phone rings)'
Chandler	 (answering it) Hello. (listens) (to Ross) It\xc2\x92s Gandolf!!! (on\nphone) So, are you in town? (listens) (disappointed) Oh, well, well maybe next time then.\n(Hangs up)'
Ross	 What happened?'
Chandler	 He\xc2\x92s not gonna make it, he\xc2\x92s stuck in Chicago.'
Ross	 Ohh, man! Chicago, is sooo lucky!'
Chandler	 Stupid, useless Canadian money!'
Mr. Posner	 You have a very impressive resume, Ms. Green. I especially like what\nI see here about implementing a new filing system.'
Rachel	 Thank you.'
Joanna	 Filing system? Oh-oh! You mean those-those little colored labels you put\non all the folders? (to the committee) It certainly did brighten up the inside of the\nfiling cabinets. '
Rachel	 Well, they uh, they-they do more than that.'
Mrs. Lynch	 I notice that you\xc2\x92ve been trusted with a lot of rather\nimportant responsibilities.'
Rachel	 Yes, Joanna really has been an incredible mentor to me.'
Joanna	 Oh. And Rachel has been really incredible in getting my morning bagel\nfor me. It\xc2\x92s amazing how she gets it right almost every time!'
Rachel	 I-I-I of course, I have more responsibilities than that.'
Joanna	 Oh yes, well there\xc2\x92s the coffee too. (to the committee) Rachel can\ncarry two things at once!'
Mr. Posner	 Yes, that\xc2\x92s very good. Now a uh, big part of this job is\ncultivating personal relationships, especially with designers.'
Rachel	 Yes, I realize that\xc2\x85'
Joanna	 (interrupting) And Rachel shouldn\xc2\x92t have any problem with that. The\nonly problem might be getting a little too friendly, if you know what I mean.'
Rachel	 I love working with designers!'
Joanna	 With them, under them, what\xc2\x92s the difference? Eh, Rach?'
Monica	 Hey! My first review is out!'
Phoebe	 Ohh! Oh, the Chelsea Reporter, ohh, this used to keep me so warm.'
Monica	 All right, look at my on the back page.'
Phoebe	 Oh, okay! (reading) "Would I go back to Allesandro\xc2\x92s? Sure,\nbut I\xc2\x92d have to order two meals, one for me and one for the guy pointing the gun to\nmy head." (to Monica) Wow! You really laid into this place.'
Monica	 Hey, they don\xc2\x92t pay me a penny a word to make friends.'
Phoebe	 Ooh, I gotta go. I found a guy that who could fix up the van for\ncatering.'
Monica	 Oh! Do you need me to go with you?'
Phoebe	 No-no, it\xc2\x92s okay. But are we sure we don\xc2\x92t want the waterbed?'
Monica	 Haven\xc2\x92t we made this decision?'
Phoebe	 Yeah, all right. (starts to leave)'
Monica	 Bye!'
Phoebe	 Bye!'
Monica	 (answering it) Who is it?'
Allesandro	 It\xc2\x92s Allesandro, from Allesandro\xc2\x92s.'
Monica	 Oh my God.'
Allesandro	 I want to talk to you about your review.'
Monica	 Oh my God, oh my God. (on intercom) Call me on the phone!'
Allesandro	 Why? So you could hang up on me?'
Monica	 Look, I-I\xc2\x92m never gonna let you up so you may as well just go away.'
Allesandro	 Just give me a chance too\xc2\x85'
Phoebe	 (on intercom) Hey, do you need to get in? Here you go.'
Monica	 No! Phoebe!'
Phoebe	 Hey, Monica!'

Allesandro	 (entering) I want a retraction! Our food is not\ninedible swill!'
Monica	 I couldn\xc2\x92t eat it! I had five friends who couldn\xc2\x92t eat it, and\none of them eats books.'
Allesandro	 Well our service is not grossly incompetent.'
Monica	 The waiter carried the breadsticks in his pants!'
Allesandro	 Well, you said that we except the Discover Card, which we\ndo not!'
Monica	 All right, that I\xc2\x92ll retract. But I stand by my review, I know food\nand that wasn\xc2\x92t it. You\xc2\x92re marinara sauce tasted like tomato juice! You should\nserve it with vodka and a piece of celery. '
Allesandro	 Hey! I\xc2\x92m proud of that sauce, it\xc2\x92s delicious.'
Monica	 Oh my God! You own an Italian restaurant and you think that tastes\ngood?! Where are you even from?'
Allesandro	 (shyly) Lebanon.'
Monica	 Hand me those tomatoes, I\xc2\x92m gonna show you what it should taste\nlike! Come on, hand me them.'
Allesandro	 How long is this gonna take? \xc2\x91Cause I got another critic to go\nyell at.'
Rachel	 (entering Joanna\xc2\x92s office) Umm, Joanna? I wanna talk about that\ninterview.'
Joanna	 I thought it went very well.'
Rachel	 No! It didn\xc2\x92t! That\xc2\x92s what I want to talk to you about.\n(starts to break up) Now, just to brief you\xc2\x85 (starts to cry) I may cry, but they are\nnot tears of sadness or of anger, but just of me having this discussion with you.'
Joanna	 Rachel, please, don\xc2\x92t make a scene.'
Rachel	 There\xc2\x92s nobody here!'
Joanna	 Sophie, get in here! (Sophie enters) You see! Now you\xc2\x92re making\nSophie uncomfortable!'
Sophie	 She\xc2\x92s not making me uncomfortable.'
Joanna	 Congratulations! You now just crossed the line into completely useless.\nGet out. (Sophie starts to cry and leaves)'
Rachel	 Do you want me to quit?'
Joanna	 What?! What would make you think that?'
Rachel	 Well of those things that you said in the interview, I mean if you\nbelieve any of them, I must not be a very good assistant. Y\xc2\x92know what? I\nam just gonna pack up my desk, (She goes over to get all of her belongings from the desk,\nwhich amount to a muffin and a pen) and I will be gone by the end of the day! (Realizes\nshe has nothing.) Well, I guess there\xc2\x92s no use to me sticking around \xc2\x91til the\nend of the day! (Starts to leave.)'
Joanna	 Wait-wait-wait-wait! You can put your sad little muffin back in\nit\xc2\x92s drawer. If you must know the truth, I didn\xc2\x92t want to lose a perfectly good\nassistant.'
Rachel	 What?'
Joanna	 That\xc2\x92s why I said all those things about your flirting and your\ndrinking\xc2\x85'
Rachel	 My drinking? '
Joanna	 Oh, I must\xc2\x92ve said that after you left.'
Rachel	 Said what? Exactly.'
Joanna	 That you enjoyed the occasional drink\xc2\x85ing binge.'
Rachel	 Oh my God!! Ohh, that is it! I\xc2\x92m leaving! You are just a horrible\nperson!'
Joanna	 Wait-wait-wait-wait-wait-wait-wait-wait!! If you\xc2\x92re gonna get all\nsensitive about it! I don\xc2\x92t want to lose you. What if I, create a position for you?\nI\xc2\x92ll make you an assistant buyer in this department.'
Rachel	 Say more things like that.'
Joanna	 You can have your own office, and a raise! Effective tomorrow.'
Rachel	 I\xc2\x92d need an expense account.'
Joanna	 Done!'
Rachel	 And an assistant.'
Joanna	 Sophie, get in here! (Sophie peeks in around the corner)'
Joey	 Hey! What are you guys doing here? I thought you\xc2\x92d be out partying\nwith Gandel-worf.'
Ross	 It\xc2\x92s Gandolf, and he\xc2\x92s not coming.'
Joey	 So you\xc2\x92ve been sittin\xc2\x92 around here all mornin\xc2\x92?'
Ross	 No! I balanced my checkbook. '
Chandler	 Yeah, and I-I gave first names to all of the foosball players.'
Ross	 I can\xc2\x92t believe he didn\xc2\x92t come!'
Joey	 So what if he didn\xc2\x92t come! We can still go out and party ourselves!'
Chandler	 Oh-no, y\xc2\x92know with Gandolf we\xc2\x92d be out all\nnight!'
Ross	 Yeah! We\xc2\x92d meet, we\xc2\x92d meet total strangers, and hang out with\nthem!'
Joey	 Well, we could do that! '
Ross	 There\xc2\x92s other stuff too.'
Joey	 We\xc2\x92ll do it all, and better! Look, after tonight, Gandolf will want\nto party with us, dude! Come on!'
Ross	 Yeah!'
Joey	 Yeah!'
Ross	 Yeah!!'
Joey	 Yeah!! '
Ross	 It\xc2\x92s not like we don\xc2\x92t know how to party!!'
Joey	 Yeah! All right? Let\xc2\x92s go!'
Chandler	 And may-maybe we could end up on a boat again?'
Joey and Ross	 Yeah!!!'
Chandler	 All right!!'
Ross	 (to Chandler) Hey-hey-hey, when uh, when were we on a boat?'
Chandler	 Remember that really cold morning, you woke up and those dogs were\nlicking your face?'
Ross	 Yeah.'
Chandler	 Well, those were seals, man.'
Rachel	 Hey Mon, little question for ya! How do you think this suit will look on\nan assistant buyer?'
Monica	 Okay, the owner of Allesandro\xc2\x92s came over to yell at me, but\ninstead I made him some sauce, and he offered me the job as head chef!!'
Rachel	 Oh my God!! You just ruined the thing I was practicing the whole way\nhome, but I\xc2\x92m soo happy!'
Monica	 Can you believe it? I finally get to run my own kitchen!'
Rachel	 Ohh, you\xc2\x92ve waited soo long. '
Phoebe	 (entering) Hey!'
Rachel	 Hey, Pheebs, quick question for ya.'
Phoebe	 Yeah.'
Rachel	 How do you think this suit would look on an assistant buyer at Bloomingdale\xc2\x92s?'
Phoebe	 I don\xc2\x92t know, it would totally depend on her coloring and\xc2\x85\n(realizes) You got the job!!'
Rachel	 Yes!!!'
Monica	 You got the job?! Why didn\xc2\x92t you tell me?'
Rachel	 Ohh, it\xc2\x92s gonna be so great! I\xc2\x92m gonna get to help decide what\nwe sell, I\xc2\x92m gonna have an office with walls and everything. (turns to Monica)\nI\xc2\x92m gonna have walls!'
Phoebe	 Okay, is this the day of good news or what? I got us a job! The wedding\nreception.'
Monica	 Ohh! Umm, Phoebe, I kinda need to talk to you about that. (Rachel\nexcuses herself) Umm, well I-I-I think it might be time for me to take a step back from\ncatering.'
Phoebe	 But we\xc2\x92ve only had one job.'
Monica	 I know, but now we have this second one and it just, it feels like\nit\xc2\x92s snowballing, y\xc2\x92know?'
Phoebe	 Yeah! What are you saying?'
Monica	 I got offered the head chef job at Allesandro\xc2\x92s.'
Phoebe	 What?'
Monica	 It\xc2\x92s okay, \xc2\x91cause y'know what? You don\xc2\x92t really need me\nfor the business."
Phoebe	 You\xc2\x92re the cook! With out you it\xc2\x92s just me driving up to\npeople\xc2\x92s houses with empty trays and asking for money!'
Monica	 All right. But umm, I-I-I\xc2\x92ll pay you back all the money you\ninvested, and you can keep the van.'
Phoebe	 For what? I can\xc2\x92t believe this! I gotta get out of here. (leaves) '
Monica	 Phoebe, wait a minute! (runs after her, leaving Rachel alone)'
Rachel	 I\xc2\x92m an assistant buyer!!'
Joey	 All right, so we\xc2\x92ll get a little coffee, and get energized, and\nwe\xc2\x92ll head back out.'
Chandler	 Yeah, all right.'
Ross	 Okay.'
Joey	 So, we\xc2\x92re having fun, right?'
Chandler and Ross	 Yeah.'
Joey	 We don\xc2\x92t need that wizard guy. We hit a couple of clubs, talked to\nsome strangers, and uh, after this, we\xc2\x92ll head down to the docks and see about that\nboat thing.'
Ross	 I\xc2\x92m kinda beat.'
Chandler	 Actually, me too.'
Joey	 Are you serious?!'
Chandler and Ross	 Yeah.'
Joey	 Thank God! I\xc2\x92m exhausted!'
Gunther	 So you guys want coffees?'
Joey	 Yeah, but uh, I don\xc2\x92t want to be up too late, so uh, I\xc2\x92ll have a\ndecaf. '
Ross	 Yeah, me too.'
Chandler	 Actually, can I get some hot water with a little lemon? I think I\nstrained my voice screaming in there. Does it have to be so loud?'
Joey	 I can\xc2\x92t hear a word you\xc2\x92re saying, my ears are ringing so bad.'
Ross	 I\xc2\x92m just glad I brought that extra pair of socks, y\xc2\x92know? I used\nthem as mittens, I didn\xc2\x92t want to touch a thing in that last place.'
Ross	 How sad are we?'
Joey	 Yeah, I know.'
Chandler	 Y\xc2\x92know what? We\xc2\x92re not sad, we\xc2\x92re not sad, we\xc2\x92re\njust not 21 anymore. Y\xc2\x92know? I\xc2\x92m 29 years old, damnit! And I want to sit in a\ncomfortable chair, and watch television and go to bed at a reasonable hour!'
Joey and Ross	 Yeah!'
Joey	 Yeah! And I like to hang out in a quiet place where I can talk to my\nfriends.'
Chandler and Ross	 Yeah!'
Ross	 And so what if I like to go home, throw on some Kenny G, and take a bath!'
Joey	 We\xc2\x92re 29, we\xc2\x92re not women.'
Monica	 (entering) Ohh, here you are. Y\xc2\x92know, I\xc2\x92m-I\xc2\x92m glad you\ndecided to hear me out.'
Phoebe	 Okay, I\xc2\x92m hearing.'
Monica	 I\xc2\x92ve been doing a lot of thinking. A lot! And umm, well, I came up\nwith a whole bunch of businesses you can do with your van. Okay umm, you could be flower\ndelivery person.'
Phoebe	 What?!'
Monica	 Or! A bakery delivery person.'
Phoebe	 I wa-I wa-I wa\xc2\x85'
Monica	 Pizza?!'
Phoebe	 Monica! '
Monica	 All right, I\xc2\x92ve got a whole bunch of uh-uh, stuff in this area, but\numm, I\xc2\x92m getting the feeling that you don\xc2\x92t want to deliver.'
Phoebe	 No.'
Monica	 Okay. I\xc2\x92m guessing that if you don\xc2\x92t want to deliver, you\nprobably don\xc2\x92t want to pick stuff up either.'
Phoebe	 No.'
Monica	 Y\xc2\x92know what, let\xc2\x92s do the catering business.'
Phoebe	 Really?! Are you sure?'
Monica	 Yeah, y'know I-I made a commitment to you. Y\xc2\x92know what, it\xc2\x92d\nbe, it\xc2\x92d be fun."
Phoebe	 Oh! It will be fun! Ohh! Yay! Oh! Okay, ooh, let\xc2\x92s\nplan the wedding reception. (She grabs the notebook which Monica used for her ideas and\nstarts flipping page after page after page after page after page to find a blank one.)\nWow! You really wanted me to do something with this van. (pause)\nY\xc2\x92know what, I want you to take the chef job.'
Monica	 Really?!'
Phoebe	 Yeah. That\xc2\x92s what you really want. Yeah, I don\xc2\x92t want to be\nthe reason you\xc2\x92re unhappy, that would just make me unhappy, and I really\ndon\xc2\x92t want to be the reason I\xc2\x92m unhappy.'
Monica	 Thank you.'
Phoebe	 Besides, it might be kinda fun to form the new A-Team.'
Rachel	 Oh, hi Mrs. Lynch! Is Joanna in already?'
Mrs. Lynch	 Oh my goodness! You haven\xc2\x92t heard!'
Rachel	 Heard what?'
Mrs. Lynch	 Joanna passed away last night.'
Rachel	 Oh my God! How?!'
Mrs. Lynch	 Well, she was leaving work and she was hit by a cab.'
Rachel	 Oh my God! Oh, I cannot believe it!'
Mrs. Lynch	 I know!'
Rachel	 Oh, God. Oh, God. (gets worried) Oh God.'
Mrs. Lynch	 I didn\xc2\x92t realize that she was so close.'
Rachel	 Yes, so close. Mrs. Lynch, I know that this is an\nemotional and difficult time, for all of us. But by any chance did Joanna send any\npaperwork your way before\xc2\x85 it happened.'
Mrs. Lynch	 No. Nothing. Imagine, if she had just stepped off that curb a few\nseconds later.'
Rachel	 Yes-yes, just a few seconds and she\xc2\x92d still be with us\xc2\x97nothing\nabout an assistant buyer?'
Mrs. Lynch	 (starting to cry) No, I\xc2\x92m sorry. I have to go. (She leaves as\nSophie arrives.)'
Sophie	 (happily) Good morning!'
Rachel	 Oh, Sophie, I guess you didn\xc2\x92t hear about Joanna\xc2\x85'
Sophie	 I sure did! (smiles)'

Allesandro	 I\xc2\x92m so excited about having Monica come on board with us.\nAlthough I do feel bad about having fired chef Emillio, it\xc2\x92s like losing a member of\nthe family. Of course, that literally is the case for several of you.\nTony, Carlos, Marie, please, tell your father how much we\xc2\x92re gonna miss him. Now, I\nknow that Monica has a lot of great ideas for this place, well, you all read the review.\nSo without much further ado, I present to you our new head chef.'
Monica	\xc2\xa0 Umm, I just wanna say, uh (reads from a 3 X 5 card) that with a\npinch of exictement, a dash of hard work, a dollup of cooperation, we can have the\nrecipe... (Looks up and sees eveyone glaring at her) Are you gonna kill me?'
