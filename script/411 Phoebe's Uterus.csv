Phoebe	 Oh my God! I can\xc2\x92t believe my little brother is married!'
Frank	 Oh I know!! (Both he and Alice squeal hysterically)'
Phoebe	 You guys, why didn\xc2\x92t you tell me you were eloping?'
Frank	 \xc2\x91Cause it just sorta happened, y\xc2\x92know we were at the\ncourthouse, we were having lunch\xc2\x85'
Phoebe	 Wait, wait, why were you at the courthouse? '
Frank	 We were having lunch. Yeah and then all of the sudden we were like,\n"Hey! Y\'know, we\xc2\x92re here, having lunch let\xc2\x92s get married!'
Phoebe	 Wow, a year and a half ago I didn\xc2\x92t even know I had a brother, and\nnow I have a sister too. (They all hug, and Frank and Alice start kissing.) Okay. Okay.\nStop it, don\xc2\x92t. So, I gotta get you a gift now. Is there anything you need?'
Frank	 Uhh, yeah.'
Alice	 We\xc2\x92ve been trying to get pregnant, uh pretty much ever since we got\nengaged, we thought we\xc2\x92d get a jump on things, y\xc2\x92know no one\xc2\x92s getting any\nyounger.'
Frank	 See the thing is umm, we\xc2\x92re not able to y\xc2\x92know, uh, conceive.'
Alice	 And we\xc2\x92ve tried everything, we\xc2\x92ve seen a bunch of doctors.'
Frank	 Yeah, and they-and they say that our-that our only chance to have a baby\nis that if they take my sperm, her egg and put it together in a dish and then put it into\nanother girl. So we were wondering if you could be the girl that we could put it into.'
Phoebe	 (shocked) That\xc2\x92s a really nice gift. I was thinking of like a gravy\nboat.'

Joey	 (entering with Ross) Hey! You guys! Check it out, check it out! (He\xc2\x92s\nwearing a blue blazer) Guess which job I got.'
Chandler	 I don\xc2\x92t know, but Donald Trump wants his blue blazer black.'
Ross	 What?'
Chandler	 Blue blazer back. He-he wants it back.'
Rachel	 But you-you said black. Why would he want his blue blazer black?'
Chandler	 Well, you-you know what I meant.'
Monica	 No, you messed it up. You\xc2\x92re stupid.'
Chandler	 So what job did you get Joe?'
Joey	 Oh, ah, tour guide at the museum. Yeah, Ross got it for me.'
Rachel	 Well, how can you be a tour guide, don\xc2\x92t you have to be a dinosaur\nexpert or something?'
Joey	 No, not really. They give you all the information, it\xc2\x92s uh, it\xc2\x92s\nlike memorizing a script. (Making like a tour guide) "And on your left, you have\nTyrannosaurus Rex, a carnivore from the Jurassic period.'
Chandler, Monica, and Rachel	\xc2\xa0 Great!! That\xc2\x92s great!'
Ross	 Uh actually Joey, it\xc2\x92s the Cretasous period.'
Joey	 Yeah but, I can pronounce Jurassic.'
Phoebe	 (entering) Hey!!'
All	 Hey!'
Phoebe	 Guess what. Frank Jr., and Alice got married!'
All	 Oh my God!!'
Phoebe	 And! And, they\xc2\x92re gonna have a baby! (The gang is shocked.) And!\nAnd, they want me to grow it for them in my uterus. (The gang is stunned into silence.)'
Ross	 My God!'
Monica	 Are you serious?'
Phoebe	 Yeah'
Joey	 You\xc2\x92re really thinking about having sex with your brother?!'
Phoebe	 Ewww! And "Oh no!" It\xc2\x92s\xc2\x97they just want me to be the\nsurrogate. It\xc2\x92s her-it\xc2\x92s her egg and her sperm, and I\xc2\x92m-I\xc2\x92m just the\noven, it\xc2\x92s totally their bun. '
Joey	 Huh.'
Monica	 What did you tell them?'
Phoebe	 Well, they said that I had to think about it first, but what is there to\nthink about? I\xc2\x92m gonna be giving them the greatest gift you can possibly give.'
Chandler	 You\xc2\x92re gonna be carrying their baby and give them a Sony Play\nStation?'
Rachel	 Honey, this really is an incredible thing to do for them, but there are\nthings to think about.'
Monica	 Yeah, like you\xc2\x92re gonna be pregnant. I mean pregnant.'
Phoebe	 I know!'
Ross	 Pheebs, you\xc2\x92re talking about putting your body through an awful lot,\nI mean morning sickness, uhh, labour, and it\xc2\x92s all for somebody else!'
Phoebe	 Yeah, what\xc2\x92s your point?'
Ross	 Well, the stuff I just mentioned.'
Rachel	 Wow! I don\xc2\x92t know if I could ever do that. I always figured the\nfirst time I had a baby was with somebody I love and that baby would be a\xc2\x85keeper.'
Phoebe	 Y'know you guys were a lot more supportive when I wanted to make denim\nfurniture."
Joey	 No, Pheebs, listen, if you decide to do this, we\xc2\x92ll be supportive\nlike crazy.'
All	 Yeah.'
Monica	 We just want you to think it through.'
Rachel	 Yeah, honey, maybe you can talk to somebody who\xc2\x92s had a baby. Like\nyour mom?'
Phoebe	 My mom never gave birth. Oh! But my birth mom did.'
Kathy	 Umm, (moves her hand\xc2\x92s down to his butt) I love this touchy. Can I\ntake it to work with me?'
Chandler	 Oh, yeah, sure, it\xc2\x92s not mine anyway. It can with the pants.'
Kathy	 Oh! (They kiss and she leaves)'
Monica	 I am so jealous.'
Rachel	 You guys are really right\xc2\x85there aren\xc2\x92t you?'
Chandler	 Yes. Right where?'
Monica	 In the beginning where y\xc2\x92know it\xc2\x92s all sex and talking and sex\nand talking and\xc2\x85'
Chandler	 Yeah, you-you gotta love the talking.'
Monica	 And the sex?'
Chandler	 All right, we haven\xc2\x92t had sex yet. Okay, what\xc2\x92s the big\ndeal? Y\xc2\x92know? This is special, and I want our love to grow until we move on to the\nnext level.'
Rachel	 Oh, Chandler that is so nice.'
Ross	 That is really nice\xc2\x85lying! No way is that the reason!'
Rachel	 Why? Just because you\xc2\x92re not mature enough to understand something\nlike that?!'
Chandler	 No, he\xc2\x92s right, I\xc2\x92m totally lying.'
Monica	 Then what is it?'
Chandler	 Well, Kathy\xc2\x92s last boyfriend was Joey.'
Ross	 And you\xc2\x92re afraid you won\xc2\x92t be able to\xc2\x85fill his shoes.'
Chandler	 No, I\xc2\x92m afraid I won\xc2\x92t be able to make love as well as him.'
Ross	 Yeah, I was going for the metaphor.'
Chandler	 Yes, and I was saying the actual words.'
Monica	 So big deal, so Joey\xc2\x92s had a lot of girlfriends, it doesn\xc2\x92t\nmean he\xc2\x92s great in bed.'
Chandler	 We share a wall! So either he\xc2\x92s great in bed, or she just likes\nto agree with him a lot.'
Monica	 Sweetie, with you it\xc2\x92s gonna be different. The sex is gonna be\ngreat, \xc2\x91cause you-you guys are in love.'
Chandler	 Yeah?'
Rachel	 Yeah!'
Ross	 Just go for it Chandler.'
Monica	 Yeah, you should.'
Rachel	 Yeah, you should, really.'
Monica	 Go on.'
Chandler	 All right, all right, I\xc2\x92ll go sleep with my girlfriend. But\nI\xc2\x92m just doing it for you guys.'
Joey	 Okay, now the Mastodon is from the semi-late Jurassic period.'
Smart Kid	 Isn\xc2\x92t the Mastodon from the Pliocene Epic?'
Joey	 Shhh! This is a museum, no talking. Right down here, (Motions to a\nfossilised dinosaur foot.) we have a large foot. (Sees Ross working in one of the display\ncases.) Uhh, and over here we have Ross Geller. (Knocks on the glass) Everyone wave\n\xc2\x91Hi\xc2\x92 to Ross. Ross is one of our most important scientists, look at him, hard at\nwork. (Ross does the old "Putting a cigarette in your ear and pulling it out of your\nmouth trick.") Okay, moving right along. Come on.'
Phoebe Sr	 It\xc2\x92s open! Come in!'
Phoebe	 Hi!'
Phoebe Sr	 Hi!'
Phoebe	 I\xc2\x92m sorry, I\xc2\x92m late.'
Phoebe Sr	 Oh, that\xc2\x92s okay, it gave me time to finish glazing my nipples.'
Phoebe	 Wow! You really go all out when you\xc2\x92re expecting company.'
Phoebe Sr	 No, I was working on my pottery.'
Phoebe	 Oh! Ooh! Oh, I didn\xc2\x92t know that you did\xc2\x85pot.'
Phoebe Sr	 Well, yeah, mostly nudes. It combines my two passions, pottery and\nerotica.'
Phoebe	 Ooh, erotiery!'
Phoebe Sr	 Hey! Okay! Well thanks for coming out to see me. I just-I just\nthought it would be a very good idea to talk about this baby stuff in person.\nY\xc2\x92know\xc2\x85'
Phoebe	 Okay.'
Phoebe Sr	 I really don\xc2\x92t think it\xc2\x92s a very good idea, Phoebe.'
Phoebe	 Why not?'
Phoebe Sr	 Well, because you\xc2\x92d be giving up a baby, and I-I really\ndon\xc2\x92t\xc2\x97I don\xc2\x92t know if there\xc2\x92s anything I can say that could make you\nunderstand the pain of giving up a baby. So, umm, (Picks up a puppy in the box next to the\ncouch.)'
Phoebe	 Oh no! No-no! I understand the pain! Don\xc2\x92t-don\xc2\x92t hurt the\npuppy.'
Phoebe Sr	 No-no-no, the-the puppy\xc2\x92s yours.'
Phoebe	 Oh, I get a puppy!!'
Phoebe Sr	 Well, yeah! I mean yeah, but only for three days.'
Phoebe	 Why?'
Phoebe Sr	 I realise I don\xc2\x92t have any right to start get all parenty on you\nand everything now, but umm, (Sees that Phoebe isn\xc2\x92t paying attention and is busy\nmimicking the puppy.) uhh\xc2\x85 Phoebe, would you please look at me and not the puppy,\nit\xc2\x92s very important. '
Phoebe	 Okay.'
Phoebe Sr	 I mean, I know what I\xc2\x92m talking about. I gave up two babies, and\nI only wish I had someone there that had given up babies, that could tell me how terrible\nit is to give up babies. I just think that, it would be something you will regret every\nsingle day for the rest of your life. So, how ever hard it is to give up this puppy, it\nwould be like a million times harder to give up a child. (Phoebe is playing with the puppy\nagain, and not listening) I really shouldn\xc2\x92t have given you the puppy first.'
Phoebe	 All right, I\xc2\x92m sorry.'
Joey	 Uhh, do you mind sitting there. I\xc2\x92m-I\xc2\x92m saving this for my\nfriend Ross.'
Tour Guide	 You mean Dr. Geller?'
Joey	 Doctor? Wow! I didn\xc2\x92t know he had a nickname.'
Tour Guide	 Oh, he won\xc2\x92t sit here. Only the people in the white coats sit\nover there, (Points to there table) and only the people in the blue blazers sit here.'
Joey	 Well, how-how come?'
Tour Guide	 That\xc2\x92s just the way it is.'
Joey	 That\xc2\x92s crazy.'
Tour Guide	 Maybe it\xc2\x92s crazy in a perfect world, a world without lab coats\nand blazers, but you not in a perfect world, you in a museum now. See that scientist in\nthe classes, he and I used to play together all the time in grade school, but\nnow\xc2\x85(Turns around) Peter! Hey, Peter! It\xc2\x92s me Rhonda! From PS-129! I shared my\npuddin\xc2\x92 which you man! I gave you my Snack Pack! (to Joey) See, he pretend\nhe don\xc2\x92t even here me!'
Joey	 I-I think everybody\xc2\x92s pretending they don\xc2\x92t hear you. Anyway,\nlook, I don\xc2\x92t know about you and your jackets and your separate tables, but Ross is\none of my best friends, and if I save him a seat, I\xc2\x92m telling you, he will sit\nin it! (Ross enters and goes over to the white table) Ross! Ross! Over here, man! I-I\nsaved you seat.'
Ross	 That\xc2\x92s okay, I\xc2\x92m cool over here. I\xc2\x92ll catch up with you\nlater, Joey. (Joey is shocked.)'
Tour Guide	 Op, this is saved. (Joey wonders why) Gift shop.'

Ross	 (entering) Hey, uh, I\xc2\x92m really, really sorry about what happened in\nthe cafeteria today.'
Joey	 It\xc2\x92s no big deal. Hey, y\xc2\x92know, you do what you gotta do. Right?'
Ross	 But hey, it\xc2\x92s not just me, I mean the scientists and the tour guides never\nsit together.'
Joey	 Whatever.'
Ross	 It\xc2\x92s like that everywhere, Joey! Okay, Mon, back me up here. Where\nyou work the uh, waiters eat with the waiters, right? And the chefs eat with the other\nchefs, right?'
Monica	 I eat by myself in the alley because everybody hates me.'
Joey	 Look, Ross, really it\xc2\x92s-it\xc2\x92s no big deal. Y\xc2\x92know you wear a\nwhite coat, I wear a blue blazer, if that means we can\xc2\x92t be friends at work, then so\nbe it. Y\xc2\x92know, hey I understand. Y\xc2\x92know? Hey, when I\xc2\x92m in a play and\nyou\xc2\x92re in the audience, I don\xc2\x92t talk to you, right? So it\xc2\x92s y\xc2\x92know,\nit\xc2\x92s uh, it\xc2\x92s cool. I\xc2\x92ll see you tomorrow. (Leaves)'
Rachel	 Yeah, when we\xc2\x92re in the audience he doesn\xc2\x92t talk to us, but he\ndoes wave.'
Chandler	 Hi.'
Monica	 Hey!'
Chandler	 Why is Phoebe singing to Carl Mulden?'
Phoebe	 Ooh, y\xc2\x92know what, I think it\xc2\x92s time for puppy to go out again.\nCome on, let\xc2\x92s go to the balcony.'
Monica	 What?!'
Phoebe	 Umm, the street. Come on, let\xc2\x92s go to the street. Ooh, listen,\ndon\xc2\x92t go onto the balcony until after I get back. (Leaves)'
Monica	 (to Chandler) So, did you do it?'
Chandler	 Yes, yes, we had the sex.'
Monica	 Uh-oh, it was bad?'
Chandler	 It was fine, y\xc2\x92know? But she didn\xc2\x92t agree with me as\nstrongly as she agreed with Joey. She was more like, "I see you point, I\xc2\x92m all\nright with it."'
Monica	 Well, it was the first time. Y\xc2\x92know, there\xc2\x92s not always a lot\nof agreement the first time.'
Rachel	 Yeah, not girls anyway, guys agree (snaps her fingers) like that.'
Chandler	 Look, you have to help me! Okay? I mean, I know what to do with a\nwoman, y\xc2\x92know, I know where everything goes, it\xc2\x92s always nice. But I need to\nknow what makes it go from nice to, "My God! Somebody\xc2\x92s killing her in\nthere!"'
Monica	 All right, I\xc2\x92m gonna show you something a lot of guys don\xc2\x92t\nknow. Rach, give me that pad, please? (She does so and Monica starts drawing on it) All\nright. Now\xc2\x85'
Chandler	 Look, you don\xc2\x92t have to draw an actual wo\xc2\x97whoa! She\xc2\x92s\nhot!'
Monica	 Now everybody knows the basic erogenous zones. (She starts labelling\nthem) You got one, two three, four (Chandler is shocked to find out there\xc2\x92s more than\nthree), five, six, and seven!'
Chandler	 (shocked) There are seven?!'
Rachel	 Let me see that. (Monica shows her) Oh, yeah.'
Chandler	 (Points to one) That\xc2\x92s one?'
Monica	 It\xc2\x92s kind of an important one!'
Chandler	 Oh, y\xc2\x92know-y\xc2\x92know what, I was looking at it upside down.'
Rachel	 Well, y\xc2\x92know, sometimes that helps. (She realises what that\ncould\xc2\x92ve meant.)'
Monica	 (continuing) Now, most guys will hit uh, 1-2-3 and then go to 7 and set\nup camp.'
Chandler	 That-that\xc2\x92s bad?'
Rachel	 Well if you go to Disneyland, you don\xc2\x92t spend the whole\nday on the Materhorn.'
Chandler	 Well you might if it were anything like 7!'
Monica	 All right uh, the important thing is to take your time, you want to hit\n\xc2\x91em all, and you mix \xc2\x91em up. You gotta keep them on their toes.'
Rachel	 Oo, toes!! Well, for some people. (Chandler eyes her and her toes.)'
Monica	 All right. Umm, you could uh start out with a little 1, a 2, a 1-2-3, 3,\n5, a 4, a 3-2, 2, a 2-4-6, 2-4-6, 4, (Rachel starts getting worked up) 2, 2, 4-7, 5-7,\n6-7, 7, \xc2\x857..\xc2\x857\xc2\x857-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7\xc2\x85(mouths 7)! (They both lean\nback on the couch satisfied.)'
Older Scientist	 Dr. Geller, there\xc2\x92s a seat over here. (Motions to\nan empty chair at the \xc2\x91white\xc2\x92 table.)'
Ross	 Thank you, Dr. Phillips, but I\xc2\x92m having my lunch at this table, here\nin the middle. I\xc2\x92m having lunch right here, with my good friend Joey, if he\xc2\x92ll\nsit with me.'
Joey	 (standing up) I will sit with you Dr. Geller. (He goes over to his table\nand they shake hands.)'
Ross	 Y\'know, we work in a museum of natural history, and yet there is something\nunnatural about the way we eat lunch. Now, I look around this cafeteria, and y\xc2\x92know\nwhat I see, I see-I see division. Division, between people in white coats and people in\nblue blazers, and I ask myself, "My God why?!" Now, I say we shed these-these\ncoats that separate us, and we get to know the people underneath. (He takes off his coat\nand throws it down.) I\xc2\x92m Ross! I\xc2\x92m divorced, and I have a kid!'
Joey	 (stands up, and throws his coat on the floor) I\xc2\x92m Joey! I\xc2\x92m an\nactor! I don\xc2\x92t know squat about dinosaurs!'
Another Tour Guide	 (standing up and removing his coat) I\xc2\x92m Ted, and I just\nmoved here a month ago, and New York really scares me.'
Ross	 All right, there you go!'
Joey	 Yeah, you hang in there Teddy!'
Older Scientist	 I\xc2\x92m Andrew, and I didn\xc2\x92t pay for this pear.'
Ross	 Okay, good-good for you.'
Tour Guide	 I\xc2\x92m Rhonda, (motions to her breasts) and these aren\xc2\x92t\nreal! (Joey and Ross look at each other, shocked)'
Ross	 Wow, Rhonda.'
Another Scientist	 I\xc2\x92m Scott.'
Ross	 Yeah, okay, Scott!'
Another Scientist	 And I need to flip the light switch on and off 17 times\nbefore I leave a room or my family will die.'
Phoebe	 My mom\xc2\x92s gonna be here any minute. I can\xc2\x92t do this, I\ncan\xc2\x92t give him up. Yes\xc2\x97no, I can. I don\xc2\x92t want to. But I can. No.'
Rachel	 Oo, I can\xc2\x92t watch this, it\xc2\x92s like Sophie\xc2\x92s Choice.'
Monica	 Y\xc2\x92know, I never saw that.'
Rachel	 Ooh, it was only okay.'
Phoebe	 Ooh, I can\xc2\x92t do this. My mom was right. If I can\xc2\x92t-if I\ncan\xc2\x92t give him up, then there\xc2\x92s no way I can give up a baby. Ohh, God, Frank and\nAlice are gonna be so crushed. What-what else, what else can I give \xc2\x91em\xc2\x97a\nkidney!'
Alice	 (entering with Frank) Hi!'
Frank	 Hi!'
Alice	 Uhh, we were just in the neighbourhood, so\xc2\x85'
Frank	 Yeah, so we just thought we\xc2\x92d stop by and let you know there\xc2\x92s\nstill no pressure.'
Alice	 None. But if there was something you wanted to tell us, we\xc2\x92re just\ngonna be right over there (points to the counter) having coffee.'
Phoebe	 Okay.'
Frank	 (noticing the puppy) Oh, who\xc2\x92s this little guy?! (Grabs the puppy)'
Phoebe	 Oh! Ooh! Umm!'
Frank	 Oh, he\xc2\x92s so cute, he reminds me of my old dog, Tumour.'
Alice	 You are so precious, I could just take you home.'
Phoebe	 Hey, why don\xc2\x92t you?'
Frank	 Are you serious?'
Phoebe	 Uh-huh, yeah!'
Frank	 Oh, thanks.'
Monica	 What are you doing?'
Phoebe	 No, I\xc2\x92m really okay with this. Y\xc2\x92know why? \xc2\x91Cause look at\nthem, and I made that, so\xc2\x85 I know it\xc2\x92s gonna be like a million times harder to\ngive up a baby but, oh my God, it\xc2\x92s gonna feel like a million times better, right? I\nwanna do this. (To Frank and Alice) I wanna carry your baby.'
Alice	 (shocked) Oh! Oh! Oh! Thank you so much! You don\xc2\x92t know what this\nmeans to us! Oh!'
Frank	 Oh my God, I think I\xc2\x92m gonna cry!'
Monica	 It\xc2\x92s gonna be so great.'
Phoebe Sr	 (entering) Hi! What\xc2\x92s going on?'
Phoebe	 Oh, I-I gave them the puppy and it made them so happy that I decided\nI\xc2\x92m gonna carry their baby.'
Phoebe Sr	 But Phoebe\xc2\x85'
Phoebe	 No-no-no, I know, but you and I are different people though, and this is\na totally different situation, and I know that I am not gonna regret this.'
Phoebe Sr	 Oh, I-I-I understand all that, but it\xc2\x92s just\xc2\x97that was my\npuppy.'
Phoebe	 Oh!'

Monica	 Would you ever be a surrogate for anyone?'
Rachel	 It depends on who asked.'
Monica	 What if I asked?'
Rachel	 Oh, Mon, sure.'
Monica	 Really?'
Rachel	 Yes. (Pause) You\xc2\x92re not asking are you?'
Monica	 No.'
Rachel	 Yes! Totally!'
Kathy	 Oh! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Yes! Thank you! (Runs back to\nChandler)'
