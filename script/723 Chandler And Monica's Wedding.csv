Ross	 (going up to Rachel\xc2\x92s closed door) Chandler? (He opens the door and\nlooks inside and doesn\xc2\x92t see him.) Chandler? (He checks the bathroom and still\ndoesn\xc2\x92t find him. He then finds a note on the counter. He picks it up and reads it.)'
Ross	 Hey! '

Ross	 He left that.'
Rachel	 (reading the note) Tell Monica I\xc2\x92m sorry.'
Phoebe	 (walking up) What\xc2\x92s up? (Rachel hands her the note and she reads\nit.) Tell Monica I\xc2\x92m sorry. (Pause) Tell her yourself!'

Phoebe	 Oh my God! Chandler just left though!'
Rachel	 Yeah but, maybe it\xc2\x92s not what we think. Maybe it\xc2\x92s tell Monica\nI\xc2\x92m sorry I\xc2\x85drank the last of the milk.'
Phoebe	 Or maybe he-he was writing to tell her that-that he\xc2\x92s changed his\nname, y\xc2\x92know? Tell Monica I\xc2\x92m sorry.'
Ross	 I think it means he freaked out and left!'
Phoebe	 Don\xc2\x92t be so negative! Good God! Isn\xc2\x92t it possible that Sorry\nis sitting in there (Joey and Rachel\xc2\x92s apartment) right now?!'
Rachel	 Okay. Phoebe, I-I think Ross is right. What are we gonna do?'
Ross	 Look\xc2\x97Okay, I\xc2\x92m just gonna\xc2\x97I\xc2\x92m gonna have to go find\nhim and bring him back! Okay? You-you make sure Monica does not find out, okay?'

Joey	 Oh man! They-they just redid my make-up!'
Richard	 Just the last two pages.'

Mrs. Geller	 I certainly see what the girls like coming here.'
Ross	 Why?!'
Mrs. Geller	 The sexy blonde behind the counter. (She waves at Gunther who waves\nback.)'
Ross	 (shocked) Gunther?!'
Mr. Geller	 Your mother just added him to her list.'
Ross	 What? Your-your list?'
Mrs. Geller	 Yeah, the list that\xc2\x97of people we\xc2\x92re allowed to\nsleep\xc2\x85'

Rachel	 (closing the door) Ross said there\xc2\x92s still no word from Chandler.'
Phoebe	 Oh man.'
Rachel	 Oh but he did say that they found the grandmother wandering down fifth\navenue.'
Phoebe	 Okay. Well there\xc2\x92s one down.'
Monica	 (entering from her room, excitedly) I\xc2\x92m getting married today!!!\n(She trips and falls.) (Getting up) I think I just cracked a rib. But I don\xc2\x92t care\nbecause today\xc2\x92s my wedding day! My day is finally here!! (Runs back into her room.)'
Phoebe	 Y\xc2\x92know she might not even notice he\xc2\x92s gone.'
Monica	 (re-entering) I\xc2\x92m gonna start getting ready! (Goes back into her\nroom.)'
Rachel	 God! Don\xc2\x92t\xc2\x97We can\xc2\x92t let her start getting ready! This is\ntoo awful! Oh God, but wait she\xc2\x92ll be in the gown and then he won\xc2\x92t show up and\nthen she\xc2\x92s gonna have to take off the gown\xc2\x85'
Phoebe	 Shhh! Stop it! Stop it Rachel! You can\xc2\x92t do this here! (She drags\nher into the bathroom.)'
Rachel	 I\xc2\x92m sorry. I\xc2\x92m sorry. It\xc2\x92s just\xc2\x85It\xc2\x92s just so\nsad!'
Phoebe	 Yeah, but you\xc2\x92ve got to pull yourself together! Monica can\xc2\x92t\nsee you like this! Then she\xc2\x92ll know something\xc2\x92s wrong!'
Rachel	 I know. I know. Oh God. (Looking around) There\xc2\x92s no tissue! Can you\ngrab me some toilet paper?'
Phoebe	 Yeah. (Looks.) Oh, that\xc2\x92s gone too. This is Monica\xc2\x92s\nbathroom right?!'
Rachel	 Oh!'
Phoebe	 No-no! I-I\xc2\x85I found one.'
Rachel	 Okay.'
Rachel	 Oh thank you! (Wiping her nose.) Oh God! (She throws it out.) Can I have\nanother one?'
Phoebe	 (looking into the trash can) Sure. (Reaching into the trash can.) Do you\nneed some floss? (Grabs a piece of it.)'
Rachel	 Oh God I just can not imagine what is gonna happen if Chandler\ndoesn\xc2\x92t show up!'
Phoebe	 Oh here\xc2\x92s a whole bunch.'
Rachel	 Oh, I mean she\xc2\x92s gonna be at the wedding waiting for him and people\nwill be whispering, "Oh that poor girl." Y\xc2\x92know? Then she\xc2\x92ll have to\ncome back here and live all alone.'
Phoebe	 (finding something interesting in the trash can) Oh my God!'
Rachel	 What?'
Phoebe	 There was a pregnancy test in the garbage, and it\xc2\x92s positive.\nMonica\xc2\x92s pregnant. (Rachel covers her mouth.) So I guess she won\xc2\x92t be totally\nalone.'

Rachel	 Oh my God!'
Phoebe	 I know! Monica\xc2\x92s gonna have a baby! Hey, can this count as her\nsomething new?'
Rachel	 Oh my God!'
Phoebe	 Hey, do you think this is why Chandler took off?'
Rachel	 No, she had to have just taken that test because I took out the trash\nlast night.'
Phoebe	 Oh God, this is turning into the worst wedding day ever! The bride is\npregnant. The groom is missing. And I\xc2\x92m still holding this. (She throws the test back\ninto the trash.)'
Rachel	 Okay Phoebe, we can not tell anyone about this.'
Phoebe	 Right.'
Rachel	 Okay?'
Phoebe	 Yeah, okay. Hey, wait. Do you know what kind of birth control she was\nusing?'
Rachel	 No. Why?'
Phoebe	 Just for the future, this is hardly a commercial for it.'
Rachel	 Anything?'
Ross	 No! I talked to Joey on the set, he hasn\xc2\x92t heard from him. I-I-I\ntalked to Chandler\xc2\x92s parents again!'
Phoebe	 You told them he was missing?'
Ross	 No! I made it seem like I was just calling to chat. Pretty sure, they both\nthink I\xc2\x92m interested in them.'
Rachel	 All right, we\xc2\x92ve got to tell her he\xc2\x92s gone. (Starts to leave.)'
Ross	 No! Hey! Hey! We can\xc2\x92t!'
Rachel	 Ross, she\xc2\x92s gonna start getting ready soon!'
Ross	 Well, can\xc2\x92t you at least stall her a little? I\xc2\x92ll-I\xc2\x92ll go\nback to some of the places I went last night.'
Rachel	 All right, well how much time do you need?'
Ross	 Well how much time before she absolutely has to start getting ready?'
Rachel	 One hour.'
Ross	 Give me two.'
Rachel	 Then why do you ask?!'
Ross	 Okay, wish me luck.'
Phoebe	 Okay. I\xc2\x92m going with you.'
Ross	 Why?!'
Phoebe	 Ross, you\xc2\x92re tired. You\xc2\x92ve been looking all night. And clearly\nyou suck at this.'
Rachel	 All right, I\xc2\x92ll see you guys later.'
Phoebe	 Okay. Wait, do you know how you\xc2\x92re going to stall her?'
Rachel	 I\xc2\x92ll figure something out.'
Phoebe	 All right. Good luck.'
Rachel	 Thanks.'
Monica	 Hey! Okay, so I thought we\xc2\x92d start with my make up and then do my\nhair.'
Rachel	 Okay uh, but before you do that. I-I, I need you to talk to me.'
Monica	 About what?'
Rachel	 Umm\xc2\x85 I\xc2\x92m never gonna getting married!'
Monica	 Yeah you will! The right guy is just around the corner! Okay, are we\ndone with that?'
Rachel	 No Monica! I\xc2\x92m serious! Oh, maybe I should just forget about it.\nBecome a lesbian or something.'
Monica	 Any woman would be lucky to have ya.'
Rachel	 Well maybe it would make me feel better if I slept with Joey.'
Monica	 (jumping up) Rachel! You okay?'
Joey	 Excuse me, Aaron? (The director turns around.) Hi! Umm, I have a little\nproblem with the schedules. Originally, I wasn\xc2\x92t supposed to work today, and I have\nthis wedding that I really have to be at. It\xc2\x92s my best friend\xc2\x92s, and I\xc2\x92m\nofficiating so I really can\xc2\x92t work past four.'
The Director	 Joey, you gotta stay until the end. We can\xc2\x92t stop filming\njust for you. It\xc2\x92s not like it\xc2\x92s your wedding. (Starts to walk away.)'
Joey	 I\xc2\x92m having surgery!'
The Director	 What?!'
Joey	 Yeah, I-I just made up the stuff about the wedding because I didn\xc2\x92t\nwant you to worry about me. But, I\xc2\x92m having surgery today.'
The Director	 What kind of surgery?!'
Joey	 Transplant.'
The Director	 But you\xc2\x92re supposed to work on Monday.'
Joey	 Hair transplant.'
The Director	 But you\xc2\x92re not bald.'
Joey	 It\xc2\x92s not on my head.'
The Director	 Look Joey, there\xc2\x92s nothing I can do. Besides, you\xc2\x92re\nprobably gonna be out by four anyway. We\xc2\x92ve just got one short scene. It\xc2\x92s just\nyou and Richard, and God knows he\xc2\x92s a pro. You\xc2\x92ll be fine. (Walks away and sees\nRichard entering.) Morning Richard.'
Joey	 Hey! You\xc2\x92re here! Great! Great! Great! Let\xc2\x92s get going buddy,\nwe\xc2\x92ve got a scene to shoot!'
Richard	 I\xc2\x92m wearing two belts.'
Joey	 Are you drunk?'
Richard	 No!'
Joey	 Yes you are!'
Richard	 All right.'
Ross	 We are never gonna find him! He\xc2\x92s one guy in a huge city!'
Phoebe	 Oh my God! Is that him? (She points at someone.)'
Ross	 That is an old, Chinese woman!'
Phoebe	 He could be in disguise, y\xc2\x92know.'
Ross	 Aw, y\xc2\x92know\xc2\x85Y\xc2\x92know, maybe we\xc2\x92re-we\xc2\x92re just\napproaching this all wrong. If you\xc2\x92re Chandler and-and you wanna hide, where is the\nlast place on Earth people would think you\xc2\x92d go?'
Ross	 So this is your office?'
Chandler	 How did you guys find me? I knew I should\xc2\x92ve hid at the gym!'
Phoebe	 What the hell are you doing?!'
Chandler	 Panicking! And using the Internet to try to prove that I\xc2\x92m\nrelated to Monica. How is she?'
Ross	 She\xc2\x92s fine. She doesn\xc2\x92t know you\xc2\x92re gone. And she\ndoesn\xc2\x92t have to know, okay? Now come on, we\xc2\x92re going home.'

Chandler	 Because if I go home, we\xc2\x92re gonna become the Bings! I can\xc2\x92t\nbe the Bings!'
Ross	 What\xc2\x92s wrong with being the Bings?'
Chandler	 The Bings have horrible marriages! They yell. They fight. And they use\nthe pool boy as a pawn in their sexual games!'
Ross	 Chandler, have you ever put on a black cocktail dress and asked me up to\nyour hotel room?'
Chandler	 No.'
Ross	 Then you are neither of your parents!'
Chandler	 It\xc2\x92s not just their marriage! I mean, look at yours. Look at\neverybody\xc2\x92s! The only person that can make marriage work is Paul Newman! And\nI\xc2\x92ve met me; I am not Paul Newman. I don\xc2\x92t race cars! I don\xc2\x92t make popcorn!\nNone of my proceeds go to charity.'
Phoebe	 But look Chandler, right now, no one has a lower opinion of you than I\ndo. But I totally believe you can do this.'
Chandler	 I want to. I love her so much, but I\xc2\x92m afr\xc2\x85It\xc2\x92s too\nhuge.'
Ross	 Y\xc2\x92know, okay. You\xc2\x92re right. It is huge. So why don\xc2\x92t we\ntake it just a little bit at a time? Okay? Umm, forget getting married for a sec; just\nforget about it. Can you just come home and take a shower?'
Chandler	 Well yeah, but then\xc2\x85'
Ross	 (interrupting him) Yeah\xc2\x97No-but-but-but-but! We\xc2\x92re just gonna go\nhome and take a shower. Now, that\xc2\x92s not scary right?'
Chandler	 Depends on what you mean by we.'
Rachel	 The nights are the hardest. (Checks her watch.) But then the day comes!\nAnd that\xc2\x92s every bit as hard as the night. And then the night comes again\xc2\x85'
Monica	 (interrupting) The days and nights are hard! I get it! Okay? Look umm,\nRachel I\xc2\x92m sorry! I have to start getting ready! I\xc2\x92m getting married today!'

Rachel	 Okay. But wait!'
Monica	 What?!'
Rachel	 Let\xc2\x92s go to lunch.'
Monica	 I can\xc2\x92t go to lunch!!'
Rachel	 Right.'
Rachel	 Oh good God! I\xc2\x92ve fallen down! (She trips and falls.)'
Monica	 (entering) What\xc2\x92s going on?'

Phoebe	 (entering) Found the vest! I mean we\xc2\x92re gonna have to keep an eye\non it, y\xc2\x92know make sure we don\xc2\x92t lose it again\xc2\x85'
Rachel	 Oh!'
Monica	 Oh wow! Okay. Don\xc2\x92t scare me like that okay? I mean for a minute\nthere I was like, "Oh my God! The worst has happened!" '

Joey	 What?! He got me! Owwwwww!!!'
The Director	 Let\xc2\x92s take it from there.'

Joey	 Look, my best friends are getting married in like an hour. Okay? And\nI\xc2\x92m the minister. Please! Please! Can you pull it together?'
Richard	 Of course! I\xc2\x92m-I\xc2\x92m sorry. I-I\xc2\x92d hate you to miss\nanything like that on account of me. I can do this!'
Joey	 Thank you. Thank you.'
The Director	 Still rolling, annnnd action!'
Joey	 I would sooner die in this hellhole then see her back with you!'

Phoebe and Ross	 Cigarettes?!!'
Chandler	 Big picture please! So I was in the gift shop, and that\xc2\x92s when I\nuh, saw this. (He holds up a little, tiny baby jumper that reads I (heart) New York.)\nYeah, y\xc2\x92know what? I thought anything that can fit into this, can\xc2\x92t be scary.'
Phoebe	 Well you obviously didn\xc2\x92t see Chucky 3.'
Chandler	 But come on, look at how cute and small this is! So I got it to give\nMonica so she\xc2\x92d know I was okay.'

The Rabbi	 Are you Chandler?'
Chandler	 Are you Joey?'
Ross	 Huh. This is nice.'
Phoebe	 What?'
Ross	 I\xc2\x92ve never walked down the aisle knowing it can\xc2\x92t end in\ndivorce.'
Mrs. Geller	 Oh I wish you\xc2\x92re grandmother had lived to see this.'
Monica	 She\xc2\x92s right there.'
Mrs. Geller	 Not that old crow, my mother. (They stop and she kisses Monica on\nthe cheek.) Congratulations darling.'
Mr. Geller	 I love you sweetheart. (He kisses her and they sit down.)'
Chandler	 You look beautiful. Is this new? (Her dress.)'
Monica	 Not now.'
Chandler	 Okay.'
Monica	 (To Chandler) Who is this?'
The Rabbi	 I am Father Kalebasous.'
Chandler	 (in Monica\xc2\x92s ear) He\xc2\x92s Greek Orthodox.'
Rachel	 (leaning in) As are you\xc2\x85'
The Rabbi	 Let us begin. Dearly beloved\xc2\x85'
Joey	 (entering) That\xc2\x92s my line! (He walks up the aisle and to the rabbi) I\ncan take it from here, thanks. (To all) Dearly beloved, I\xc2\x92m sorry I\xc2\x92m a little\nlate. You may be confused by this now, (He\xc2\x92s still in costume) but you won\xc2\x92t be\nMemorial Day weekend 2002. Well, let\xc2\x92s get started before the groom takes off again.\nHuh? (Monica is shocked and looks around.) We are gathered here today, to join this man\nand this woman in the bonds of holy matrimony. I\xc2\x92ve known Monica and Chandler for a\nlong time, and I can not imagine two people more perfect for each other. And now,\nas I\xc2\x92ve left my notes in my dressing room. We shall proceed to the vows. Monica?'
Monica	 (To Rachel) He took off?'
Rachel	 Go on! Go on. (She turns back to Chandler.)'
Monica	 Chandler, for so long I\xc2\x85I wondered if I would ever find my prince,\nmy soul mate. Then three years ago, at another wedding I turned to a friend for comfort.\nAnd in stead, I found everything that I\xc2\x92d ever been looking for my whole life. And\nnow\xc2\x85here we are\xc2\x85with our future before us\xc2\x85and I only want to spend it with\nyou, my prince, my soul mate, my friend. Unless you don\xc2\x92t want to. You go!'
Joey	 Chandler?'
Chandler	 (To Ross) No, that\xc2\x92s okay. (Ross nods and retreats.) Monica I\nthought this was going to be the most difficult thing I ever gonna had to do. But when I\nsaw you walking down that aisle I realized how simple it was. I love you. Any surprises\nthat come our way it\xc2\x92s okay, because I will always love you. You are the person I was\nmeant to spend the rest of my life with. You wanna know if I\xc2\x92m sure? (He leans in and\nkisses her.)'
Joey	 You may not kiss the bride. So, I guess by the powers vested in my by the\nstate of New York and the Internet guys, I now pronounce you husband and wife. Oh wait! Do\nyou take each other?'
Chandler	 I do.'
Monica	 I do.'
Joey	 Yeah you do!'
Ross	 Rings?'
Joey	 Aw crap! Okay\xc2\x97uh\xc2\x85uh let\xc2\x92s-let\xc2\x92s do the rings. '
Joey	 We good? Yeah? Good? Once again, I pronounce you husband and wife. (To\nChandler) Now kiss her again.'
Chandler	 (To Monica) I love you. And I know about the baby.'
Monica	 What baby?'
Chandler	 Our baby.'
Monica	 We have a baby?'
Chandler	 Phoebe found your pregnancy test in the trash.'
Monica	 I didn\xc2\x92t take a pregnancy test.'
Chandler	 Then\xc2\x85who did?'
Phoebe	 Oh and they\xc2\x92re gonna have a baby.'
Rachel	 Uh-huh.'
