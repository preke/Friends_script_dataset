Phoebe	 (To Joey) Oh hey! How was your audition?'
Joey	 I\xc2\x92m sorry, do I know you?'
Phoebe	 What are you doing?'
Joey	 Nothing, I\xc2\x92m just practicing blowing you off because I\xc2\x92m gonna\nbe a big movie star!'
Phoebe	 Oh! You got it?!'
Joey	 Well, no not yet. But the audition went really good.'
Monica	 What was it for?'
Joey	 Oh, it\xc2\x92s this big budget period movie about these three Italian\nbrothers who come to America around the turn of the century. It\xc2\x92s really classy! Oh,\nand the director is supposed to be the next, next Martin Scorcese.'
Phoebe	 The next, next?'
Joey	 Yeah, there\xc2\x92s this guy from Chicago who\xc2\x92s supposed to be the\nnext Martin Scorcese, all right? But then this guy\xc2\x92s right after him. (Joey\xc2\x92s\ncell phone rings and he answers it.) Hello!'
Estelle	 Joey! It\xc2\x92s Estelle! I just talked to the casting people;\nthey loved you!'
Joey	 (to Monica and Phoebe) They loved me!'
Estelle	 Yeah, they wanna see you again tomorrow.'
Joey	 (on phone) Oh my God!'
Estelle	 There\xc2\x92s just one thing. Do you have a problem with full\nfrontal nudity?'
Joey	 Are you kidding me? I never rent a movie without it! (Listens) Oh.\n(Listens) Uh, okay uh let me call you back. (Hangs up.)'
Phoebe	 What\xc2\x92s the matter?'
Joey	 They want me to be totally naked in the movie!'
Monica	 Wow!'
Joey	 I know! My grandmother\xc2\x92s gonna see this!'
Phoebe	 Grandma\xc2\x92s gonna have to get in line.'

Phoebe	 Hey the wedding is so close! Are you getting nervous?'
Monica	 Yeah. But a part of me also can\xc2\x92t wait \xc2\x91til it\xc2\x92s over.\nChandler and I have this pact not to have sex again until the wedding.'
Ross	 A no sex pact huh? I actually have one of those going on with every woman\nin America.'
Monica	 Hey Phoebe, will you give me a hand? '
Phoebe	 Sure.'
Monica	 I gotta make up the guest bedroom. (To Ross) Hey, Cousin Cassie is\ncoming to stay with us a few days.'
Ross	 Cassie?'
Monica	 Uh-hmm.'
Ross	 Wow, I haven\xc2\x92t seen her for like forever. I wonder if she still\ncarries that Barbie everywhere she goes.'
Monica	 Ross, she\xc2\x92s 25 years old.'
Ross	 So what! I still have\xc2\x97No you\xc2\x92re probably right.'
Rachel	 (entering) Hi!'
Monica	 Hey!'
Phoebe	 Hey!'
Rachel	 Hey Pheebs, can I talk to you over here for a second?'
Phoebe	 Yeah!'
Monica	 Subtle guys!'
Phoebe	 What?!'
Monica	 I know you\xc2\x92re planning my surprise bridal shower.'
Rachel	 (laughs) Well okay\xc2\x97Well don\xc2\x92t ruin it! Just play along at\nleast!'
Monica	 Okay. Sorry. (She goes into the guest bedroom.)'
Rachel	 (To Phoebe) Oh my God! We have to throw her a shower?!'
Monica	 Hey! What did you decide to do about the movie?'
Joey	 I don\xc2\x92t know! It\xc2\x92s not like it\xc2\x92s porn! This is a serious,\nlegitimate movie. Y\xc2\x92know? And the nudity is really important to the story.'
Monica	 That\xc2\x92s what you say about porn.'
Joey	 You\xc2\x92re right. Maybe I shouldn\xc2\x92t even go on the call back.'
Monica	 No! No you should! A lot of major actors do nude scenes! I mean the\nchance to star in a movie? Come on!'
Joey	 Well that\xc2\x92s true. And I am only naked in one scene. Plus it sounds\nreally great. My character\xc2\x92s catholic and he falls in love with this Jewish girl. Who\nrun away together and they get caught in this big rainstorm. So we go into this barn and\nundress each other and hold each other. It\xc2\x92s really sweet and-and tender.'
Monica	 Plus, everyone\xc2\x92s gonna see your thing. (Giggles.)'
Phoebe	 Well when can we have this shower?'
Rachel	 She has got so much going on we-we have only two options. We have\nFriday\xc2\x85'
Phoebe	 Well that\xc2\x92s only two days away. What is the other option?'
Rachel	 Yesterday!'
Phoebe	 Well if we make it yesterday, woo-hoo! We\xc2\x92re done!'
Rachel	 Oh my God Phoebe, this is impossible! We can\xc2\x92t do this by Friday!\nWe have to find a place. We have to invite people! We have to get food! There\xc2\x92s just\ntoo much to do! It\xc2\x92s impossible! We can\xc2\x92t do it! We cannot do it! We cannot do\nit!'
Phoebe	 Rachel, calm down!'
Rachel	 (calmly) Okay. I\xc2\x92m sorry. You\xc2\x92re right, you\xc2\x92re right.'
Phoebe	 (grabs and shakes Rachel) Just calm down woman!'
Rachel	 Phoebe, I already, I already did.'
Phoebe	 Oh okay. All right, then I need to calm down a little.'
Rachel	 Okay. Okay. (They sit down.) I think we can do this if we just get\norganized. All right? We have two days to plan this party. We just need to make fast\ndecisions! Okay? All right, where are we gonna have it?'
Phoebe	 Uh, here. What time?'
Rachel	 4 o\xc2\x92clock. Food?'
Phoebe	 Finger sandwiches and tea.'
Rachel	 Ooh great! Very Monica.'
Phoebe	 And chili!'
Rachel	 Ah you went one too far. Uh, flowers or balloons?'
Phoebe	 Both!'
Rachel	 We\xc2\x92re paying for this y\xc2\x92know.'
Phoebe	 Neither.'
Rachel	 Okay. Umm, what should we do for the theme?'
Phoebe	 Lusts of the flesh.'
Rachel	 (pause) What?'
Phoebe	 I don\xc2\x92t know. (Timidly) A cowboy theme?'
Chandler	 Hey!'
Monica	 Hey!'
Chandler	 Y\xc2\x92know I\xc2\x92m-I\xc2\x92m really glad we decided not to sleep\ntogether before the wedding.'
Monica	 Oh boy me too!'
Chandler	 Y\xc2\x92know I was thinking if we had a\xc2\x85a big fight and uh we\nbroke up for a few hours\xc2\x85'
Monica	 Yeah?'
Chandler	 Technically we could have sex again. What do you think, bossy and\ndomineering?!'
Monica	 The wedding is off, sloppy and immature!'
Chandler	 That\xc2\x92s me! Come on!'
Monica	 Okay. (They both jump up to head for there room, but Monica stops.) But\nwait, we can\xc2\x92t. My Cousin Cassie is in the guest room, we\xc2\x92re supposed to have\nlunch.'
Chandler	 Well get rid of her, obsessive and shrill.'
Monica	 Shrill?! The wedding is back on!'
Cassie	 I thought I heard voices. You must be Chandler.'
Chandler	 (transfixed) Hi! Nice to meet you!'
Cassie	 Nice to meet you too.'
Monica	 So, are you ready to go?'
Cassie	 Yeah.'
Monica	 (catching him) Chandler!'
Chandler	 I\xc2\x92ll be right with you.'
Monica	 (To Ross) Cassie needs to stay at your place.'
Ross	 What\xc2\x97why?'
Monica	 Because Purvry Perverson over here can\xc2\x92t stop staring at her.'
Ross	 What?! Chandler she\xc2\x92s our cousin!'
Chandler	 I was not staring at her. Okay? I was just listening intently.\nIt\xc2\x92s called being a good conversationalist. Watch. (Stares at Monica\xc2\x92s eyes.)\nSay something.'
Monica	 You were staring about eight inches south of there.'
Ross	 Fine, she can stay at my place. By the way, what-what does Cassie even\nlook like now.'
Monica	 She looks exactly like Aunt Marilyn.'
Chandler	 Umm, so this Aunt Marilyn is-is-is-is she coming to the wedding?'
Monica	 Wafer thin ice!'
Joey	 Hey, I\xc2\x92m back!'
The Casting Director	 Hi-hi Joey.'
Joey	 Uh so, will-will I be reading the same scene again?'
The Casting Director	 Actually, I tried to call to you. You didn\xc2\x92t need to\ncome down here today.'
Joey	 Oh great! Y\xc2\x92know I would\xc2\x92ve been perfect for this part, but\nwhatever! Y\xc2\x92know, thanks for making a bad decision and ruining your movie! Good day!\n(Starts to leave.)'
The Casting Director	 Wait Joey! You didn\xc2\x92t need to come down because the\ndirector saw your tape from yesterday and loved it.'
Joey	 And scene! Huh? Wasn\xc2\x92t that fun? We did a little improv there. Yeah!\nOkay! So you-you-you-you were saying?'
The Casting Director	 Well, the director thinks you\xc2\x92re really right for the\npart and wants to meet you tomorrow.'
Joey	 Wow! Sure! That\xc2\x92s great!'
The Casting Director	 Oh and your agent said you were okay with the nudity.'
Joey	 Yeah! Yeah sure, just long as it\xc2\x92s handled tastefully and that barn\nis not too cold.'
The Casting Director	 Terrific! Well uh, there\xc2\x92s one more thing. Uhh, uh\nit\xc2\x92s really important to the director that everything in this movie is authentic.\nYeah and so in your love scene with Sarah she talks about how she\xc2\x92s never seen a\nnaked man who wasn\xc2\x92t Jewish. So\xc2\x85 (Laughs.)'
Joey	 So\xc2\x85What?'
The Casting Director	 So uh well the director is insisting that whoever play\nthat part be authentically, anatomically not Jewish. Do you know what I\xc2\x92m saying?'
Joey	 Yes!'
The Casting Director	 Okay.'
Joey	 No. What?'
The Casting Director	 An Italian Catholic immigrant at this time would not\nbe\xc2\x85'
Joey	 Barmifsaed?'
Monica	 So to get this part you can\xc2\x92t be?'
Joey	 Nope.'
Monica	 But you are?'
Joey	 Yep.'
Monica	 But you told them you weren\xc2\x92t?'
Joey	 That\xc2\x92s right.'
Monica	 Wow! Wow! And it\xc2\x92s definitely all gone? There\xc2\x92s nothing there\nto work with? (Joey glares at her.) What were you thinking?'
Joey	 I don\xc2\x92t know! I really want this part! And they tell you no matter\nwhat you get asked at an audition you say yes. Like if-if they want you to ride a horse,\nyou tell \xc2\x91em you can! And just figure out how to do it later.'
Monica	 Joey! This is not like learning to ride a horse! This is like learning\nto\xc2\x85grow a turtleneck!'
Joey	 I kn-I know! I know! Okay? And apparently tomorrow when I go in to meet\nthe director I have to take off my clothes so that they can see what my body looks like.'
Monica	 Oh my God, what are you gonna do?!'
Joey	 I just have to call my agent and tell her I can\xc2\x92t do the part. (Gets\nup for the phone.)'
Monica	 Unless!'
Joey	 Unless what?'
Monica	 Well, this may sound crazy, but there maybe something we could fashion.'
Joey	 Like what?'
Monica	 Well I\xc2\x92m not sure yet, but umm of the top of my head I\xc2\x92m\nthinking double sided tape and some sort of luncheon meat.'
Phoebe	 Hey! I\xc2\x92ve got a great idea for party favors for the shower. Okay,\nwe get some uh mahogany boxes and carve everyone\xc2\x92s names in them and inside is\neveryone\xc2\x92s individual birth stone.'
Rachel	 Okay. Okay. All right, you take care of that. And meanwhile, the party\nis tomorrow and we still don\xc2\x92t have a guest list.'
Phoebe	 Okay. Okay! Well okay, who do we know that\xc2\x92s coming? Me. Are you?'
Monica	 (entering) Hey!'
Phoebe	 Hey!'
Rachel	 Hey! What\xc2\x92s up Mon?'
Monica	 Well uh, I\xc2\x92m trying to make something for Joey. Do you mind if I\nraid your fridge?'
Rachel	 Have at it.'
Monica	 Okay. (Opens the fridge.) All right, turkey. Eh, that won\xc2\x92t work.\nCheese? (Picks it up) That won\xc2\x92t work. Olive loaf? (Picks it up) I hope that\nwon\xc2\x92t work.'
Rachel	 Are you makin\xc2\x92 him a sandwich?'
Monica	 No it\xc2\x92s umm, more like a wrap. Okay so uh, I\xc2\x92m gonna go guys. '
Phoebe and Rachel	 Okay.'
Monica	 I guess you can get back to deciding on what to get me for a present!\n(Runs out.)'
Rachel	 (To Phoebe, after Monica\xc2\x92s gone) We have to get her a present?!'
Phoebe	 Okay but look! Look at what I got! It\xc2\x92s her address book! (Holds it\nup.) We have a guest list!'
Rachel	 Oh my God you\xc2\x92re amazing! Did you just pull that out of her purse?'
Phoebe	 Uh-huh, and a little seed money for the party. (Holds up $40.)'
Ross	 (shocked at her beauty) Cassie?!'
Cassie	 Hey Ross!'
Ross	 Hey!'
Cassie	 (hugs him) It\xc2\x92s been so long! Last time I saw you, you were setting\nup your tent in line to see Return of the Jedi.'
Ross	 Oh. Oh, that\xc2\x92s right. So-so you did see me that day because it seemed\nlike you didn\xc2\x92t.'
Cassie	 Ah yeah, sorry about that.'
Ross	 It\xc2\x92s okay. Come, come on in.'
Cassie	 Thanks for letting me stay here! I mean Monica\xc2\x92s place was nice,\nbut her fiancee sure stares a lot.'
Ross	 Oh.'
Cassie	 Oh my God! You do a great Chandler!'
Ross	 Uh-huh. Yeah I-I have a knack for impressions.'
Cassie	 Well, maybe after we get reacquainted uh, you can do me.'
Ross	 Yeah\xc2\x97No!!'

Ross	 Cassie, how you-how you doin\xc2\x92 on that\xc2\x85hot dog.'
Cassie	 I\xc2\x92m all done.'
Ross	 (quietly) Thank God.'
Cassie	 I guess the last time we really hung out was when our parents rented\nthat beach house together.'
Ross	 Oh right. Right. Ooh, remember the time I uh, I pinned you down and\ntickled you \xc2\x91til you cried? (She laughs) We\xc2\x92re probably too old to do that now.'
Cassie	 I\xc2\x92ll always remember that summer, because it\xc2\x92s when I got all\nof these freckles. (She pulls her blouse open to show him her shoulder and bra strap.)'
Ross	 (looking then moving away quickly) Uh-huh! Uh-huh! And-and-and I\xc2\x92ll\nalways remember that summer because that\xc2\x92s when I realized that we are related.'
Cassie	 It took you that long to figure it out, huh?'
Ross	 Well I\xc2\x92m, I\xc2\x92m a little slow. (To himself) Just as our children\nwould be.'
Phoebe	 Hi!'
Woman	 Hi!'
Phoebe	 How are you? (The woman nods) Good. (She goes over to another couple of\nwomen.) Hi, thanks for coming.'
Woman	 Oh thank you.'
Phoebe	 Thank you. (To the other woman) No? (She nods.) All right. (She goes to\nanother pairing.) Oh, it\xc2\x92s so nice to see you.'
Woman	 No.'
The Other Woman	 No thanks.'
Phoebe	 Okay. (Goes over to Rachel.) Hey Rach?'
Rachel	 Yeah?'
Phoebe	 Who the hell are all these people?'
Rachel	 Well, I don\xc2\x92t know. I called all the people in Monica\xc2\x92s phone\nbook and these are the only ones who could show up on 24 hours notice.'
Phoebe	 Hmm, y\xc2\x92know there\xc2\x92s another word for people like that. Losers!'
Rachel	 (to her) Hi! I\xc2\x92m Rachel. This is Phoebe. I\xc2\x92m the maid of\nhonor. How do you know Monica?'
Woman	 I was her accountant four years ago.'
Rachel	 Ohhhh!'
Woman	 I\xc2\x92m very interested to find out who\xc2\x92s been doing her taxes\nthese last four years.'
Rachel	 That\xc2\x92s great!'
Woman	 So, what time is Monica supposed to get here?'
Phoebe and Rachel	 (to each other) I don\xc2\x92t know.'
Rachel	 (to the woman) Excuse us for a minute. (They go into the kitchen.) You\ndidn\xc2\x92t tell her to come?!'
Phoebe	 You were supposed to tell her!'
Rachel	 No I wasn\xc2\x92t! You were supposed to tell her to come and I was\nsupposed to bring the cake!'
Phoebe	 Fine, I\xc2\x92ll go call her.'
Rachel	 Yes! And please tell her to bring a cake!'
Monica	 Okay, we have a lot of options here, a number of prototypes for you to\ntry on.'
Joey	 Wow! This looks great!'
Monica	 Yeah! Okay, this one is a mushroom cap. (Points to it.) Umm, this one is\nmade of bologna. (Points.)'
Joey	 And-and-and-and-and the toothpicks?'
Monica	 Oh, just until the glue dries.'
Joey	 Thank God!'
Monica	 (to a whole group) Now, these are-are more realistic, but perishable. '
Joey	 Ah.'
Monica	 Okay? (To a different group) Over here we have pink suede, which is\nnice. But umm, if it gets wet then you know it\xc2\x92s gonna shrink.'
Joey	 Well maybe we just take that one away. (Picks it up and throws it away.)'
Monica	 I also, did a little something in fur. But umm, that\xc2\x92s really just\nfor me. (Rubs it against her cheek.) Okay. So, why don\xc2\x92t you go into your room and\ntry these on and we\xc2\x92ll see\xc2\x97get a better idea of what\xc2\x92s gonna work.'
Joey	 Thanks, you are such a good friend. And this is so weird.'
Joey	 Ow!'
Monica	 Toothpick?'
Joey	 Yeah.'
Monica	 What are you trying on now?'
Joey	 The fruit roll up.'
Monica	 And?'
Joey	 Delicious.'
Monica	 Joey!'
Joey	 Wait a minute! Wait a minute! We have a winner!'
Monica	 What?! Which one?!'
Joey	 The Silly Putty! It\xc2\x92s not so silly anymore!'
Ross	 (in his head) She\xc2\x92s your cousin. She\xc2\x92s your cousin! If\nshe knew what was going on in your head she\xc2\x92d think you were sick! (She grabs\nsome popcorn.) Or would she? Let\xc2\x92s back up a second. She was the one who\nsuggested opening a bottle of wine. She was the one who turned down the lights. She\nwas the one that wanted to rent Logan\xc2\x92s Run, the sexiest movie ever. (She\ngrabs the blanket from behind him and looks at him.) Oh, I know that look. Forget it. I\nwant it. She wants it. I\xc2\x92m going in. '
Cassie	 Hey! What the hell are you doing?! (They sit back up.)'
Ross	 (in his head) Say something clever! (Pause.) Okay, doesn\xc2\x92t\nhave to be clever, it just has to be words. Say some words. (Pause) Any words will\ndo. (Pause) Oh my God! This is the longest that anyone has not talked ever! (Pause)\nThere is nothing you can say to make this worse!! So just say something!! (Pause.) (To\nher) I-I, I uh haven\xc2\x92t had sex in a very long time. (She leaves.) (In his\nhead) Yeah, you really shouldn\xc2\x92t have said anything.'
Monica	 Phoebe! Rachel! It\xc2\x92s Monica! I wonder what you could possibly need\nme for on such short notice! (She bursts into the apartment to find only Phoebe and Rachel\nsitting on the couch.) Oh.'
Rachel	 Oh Monica, we are so sorry.'
Monica	 For what?'
Rachel	 Well first, for forgetting to throw you a bridal shower.'
Phoebe	 And then for forgetting to invite you to it.'
Monica	 You al-you already had it?'
Phoebe	 Yeah. Well, we called everyone in your phone book and bunch of people\ncame, but it took us so long to get you here that they-they had to leave.'
Rachel	 Yeah, we wanted to throw you a big surprise and a great shower, and now\nyou don\xc2\x92t have either.'
Phoebe	 We ruined everything.'
Rachel	 Ugh\xc2\x85'
Monica	 Well no wait a minute that\xc2\x92s not true! No, what did, that was\nreally sweet. And it kinda works out for the best.'
Rachel	 What do you, what do you mean?'
Monica	 Well now, I get to spend my shower with the only people I really love! I\nmean, I get all those presents (Motions to the pile in the corner) without having to talk\nto people I don\xc2\x92t even like!'
Rachel	 Surprise\xc2\x85'
Phoebe	 Sur-surprise.'
Rachel	 \xc2\x85Monica.'
Joey	 And what\xc2\x92s cool is, the character is from Naples, right? '
The Director	 Yeah.'
Joey	 My whole family\xc2\x92s from Naples!'
The Director	 Oh that\xc2\x92s great! Okay, well I\xc2\x92ve heard everything I need\nto hear. I just need to uh, Leslie\xc2\x85'
The Casting Director	 Joey, this is awkward part.'
Joey	 Oh! Hey right! Not a problem. (He starts taking off his clothes.) I\ntotally understand. You need to y\xc2\x92know make sure I don\xc2\x92t have any horrible scars\nor tattoos. Don\xc2\x92t you worry; I have nothing to hide. (He drops his pants and stands\nback up and looks down.) So there you go, that\xc2\x92s me. (We cut to a camera angle\nlooking at the casting director and movie director through Joey\xc2\x92s legs.) One hundred\npercent natural! (Suddenly, there\xc2\x92s a thud as something falls off.) (Everyone is\nshocked.) I tell ya, that has never happened before.'

Phoebe	 Cassie, are you finding everything okay in there?'
Cassie	 Yeah! Thank you so much for letting me stay here.'
Phoebe	 Oh! No problem! I\xc2\x85 (Cassie emerges from the bathroom and we once\nagain visit slow motion Barry White background music land with the sexy hair-flipping\nthing going on, only this time Phoebe is entranced. For more information on Denise\nRichards you can visit your local library or look her up on the Internet at her official\nwebsite at www.deniserichards.com.)'
Cassie	 (noticing her) What?'
Phoebe	 (in her head) Say something! Say anything! Ask her out! She\xc2\x92s\nnot your cousin!'
