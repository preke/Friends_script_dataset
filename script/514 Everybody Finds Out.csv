Phoebe	 (looking out the window) Oh hey, you guys, look! Ugly Naked Guy is\nputting stuff in boxes!'
Rachel	 I'd say from the looks of it; our naked buddy is moving."
Ross	 Ironically, most of the boxes seem to be labeled clothes.'
Rachel	 Ohh, I'm gonna miss that big old squishy butt."
Chandler	 And we're done with the chicken fried rice."
Ross	 Hey! Hey! If he's moving, maybe I should try to get his place!"
All	 Good idea! Yes!'
Ross	 It would be so cool to live across from you guys!'
Joey	 Hey, yeah! Then we could do that telephone thing! Y'know, you have a can,\nwe have a can and it's connected by a string!"
Chandler	 Or we can do the actual telephone thing.'

Ross	 Oh my God! I love this apartment! Isn't it perfect?! I can't believe I\nnever realized how great it is!"
Rachel	 Well that is because your eye immediately goes to the big naked man.'
Phoebe	 It's amazing! You better hurry up and fill out an application or I'm\ngonna beat you to it."
Ross	 (laughing) Ohh. (Phoebe takes a couple of steps to the door and Ross\nquickly hurries out.)'
Rachel	 Well, I never thought I'd say this, but I'm gonna go use Ugly Naked\nGuy's bathroom. (Does so.)"
Phoebe	 (looking out the window) Oh, look! There's Monica and Chandler! (Starts\nyelling.) Hey! Hey, you guys! Hey! (Chandler and Monica start taking each other's clothes\noff.) Ohh!! Ohh! Ahh-ahhh!!"
Rachel	 What?!'
Phoebe	 (screaming) Ahhh!! Chandler and Monica!! Chandler and Monica!!'
Rachel	 Oh my God!'
Phoebe	 CHANDLER AND MONICA!!!!'
Rachel	 OH MY GOD!!!'
Phoebe	 OH!! MY EYES!!! MY EYES!!!!'
Rachel	 Phoebe!! Phoebe!! It's okay!! It's okay!!"
Phoebe	 NO! THEY'RE DOING IT!!!"
Rachel	 I KNOW!! I KNOW!! I KNOW!'
Phoebe	 YOU KNOW?!!!'
Rachel	 Yes, I know! And Joey knows! But Ross doesn't know so you have to stop\nscreaming!!"
Ross	 (entering) What's going on?"
Phoebe and Rachel	 Ohhh!!!'
Rachel	 (trying to divert his attention from the window by jumping up and down)\nHI!! Hi! '
Ross	 What?! What?!'
Rachel	 Nothing! Oh God, we're just so excited that you want to get this\napartment!"
Ross	 Actually, it looks really good. (Turns towards the window and now Phoebe\nstarts jumping to divert his attention.)'
Phoebe	 (Screaming incoherently.) Get in here!!! (Motions to join her and\nRachel.)'
Phoebe	 You mean whenever Monica and Chandler where like y'know doing laundry or\ngoing grocery shopping or\xc2\x97Oh! All that time Monica spent on the phone with sad Linda\nfrom camp!"
Rachel	 Uh-huh, doing it. Doing it. Phone doing it.'
Phoebe	 Oh! Oh, I can't believe it! I mean I think it's great! For him. She\nmight be able to do better."
Joey	 (entering) Hey guys!'
Rachel	 Joey! Come here! Come here!'
Joey	 What? What?'
Rachel	 Phoebe just found out about Monica and Chandler.'
Joey	 You mean how they're friends and nothing more? (Glares at Rachel.)"
Rachel	 No. Joey, she knows! We were at Ugly Naked Guy's apartment and we\nsaw them doing it through the window. (Joey gasps) Actually, we saw them doing it up against\nthe window."
Phoebe	 Okay, so now they know that you know and they don't know that Rachel\nknows?"
Joey	 Yes, but y'know what? It doesn't matter who knows what. Now, enough of us\nknow that we can just tell them that we know! Then all the lying and the secrets would\nfinally be over!"
Phoebe	 Or, we could not tell them we know and have a little fun of our\nown.'
Rachel	 Wh-what do you mean?'
Phoebe	 Well y'know every time that they say that like they're doing laundry\nwe'll just give them a bunch of laundry to do."
Rachel	 Ohhh, I-I would enjoy that!'
Joey	 No-no-no! No-no wait Rach, you know what would even be more fun? Telling\nthem.'
Rachel	 Ehhh, no, I wanna do Phoebe's thing."
Joey	 I can't take any\xc2\x85"
Phoebe	 No! You don't have to do anything! Just don't tell them that we know!"
Joey	 Noo! I can't take any more secrets! (To Rachel) I've got your secrets.\nI've got their secrets. I got secrets of my own y'know!"
Rachel	 You don't have any secrets!"
Joey	 Oh yeah? Well, you don't know about Hugsy, my bedtime penguin pal. (Joey\nshies away.)"
Rachel	 (To Phoebe) So umm, how-how are we gonna mess with them?'
Joey	 Ugh.'
Phoebe	 Well, you could use your position y'know as the roommate."
Rachel	 Okay.'
Phoebe	 And then. I would use y'know the strongest tool at my disposal. My\nsexuality."
Chandler	 (entering) Hello children!'
All	 Hey!'
Phoebe	 Okay, watch, learn, and don't eat my cookie."
Chandler	 Hey.'
Phoebe	 Hey! Ooh, wow that jacket looks great on you!'
Chandler	 Really?'
Phoebe	 (feels his arm) Yeah the material feels so soft\xc2\x97hello Mr. Bicep!\nHave you been working out?'
Chandler	 Well, I try to y'know, squeeze things. (Phoebe giggles\nuncontrollably.) Are you okay?"
Phoebe	 Well, if you really wanna know, I'm\xc2\x97Oh! I can't tell you this."
Chandler	 Phoebe, it's me. You can tell me anything."
Phoebe	 Well actually you're the one person I can't tell this too. And the one\nperson I want to the most."
Chandler	 What's going on?"
Phoebe	 I think it's just y'know that I haven't been with a guy in so long and\nhow sometimes you're looking for something and you just don\xc2\x92t even see that it's\nright there in front of you sipping coffee\xc2\x97Oh no, have I said to much? Well it's just\nsomething to think about. I know I will."
Monica	 You are so cute! How did you get to be so cute?'
Chandler	 Well, my Grandfather was Swedish and my Grandmother was actually a\ntiny little bunny.'
Monica	 Okay, now you're even cuter!!"
Chandler	 Y'know that is a popular opinion today I must say."
Monica	 What?'
Chandler	 The weirdest thing happened at the coffee house, I think, I think\nPhoebe was hitting on me.'
Monica	 What are you talking about?'
Chandler	 I'm telling you I think Phoebe thinks I'm foxy."
Monica	 That's not possible!"
Chandler	 Ow!'
Monica	 I'm sorry it's just, Phoebe just always thought you were, you were\ncharming in a, in a sexless kind of way."
Chandler	 Oh, y'know I-I can't hear that enough."
Monica	 I'm sorry, I think that you just misunderstood her."
Chandler	 No, I didn't misunderstand, okay? She was all over me! She touched my\nbicep for crying out loud!"
Monica	 This bicep?'
Chandler	 Well it's not flexed right now!"
Rachel	 Hey Mon, what are you doing now? Wanna come see a movie with us?'
Monica	 Uhh, y'know actually I was gonna do some laundry."
Rachel	 Oh.'
Monica	 Hey Chandler, wanna do it with me?'
Chandler	 Sure, I'll do it with ya."
Monica	 Okay.'
Rachel	 Okay great, hold on a sec! (She runs to her room and returns carrying a\nhuge bag of laundry.) Oh, here you go! You don't mind do ya? That would really help me out\na lot! Thanks!"
Monica	 I mean I-I don't I think I have enough quarters."
Phoebe	 I have quarters! (She holds up a bag of quarters.)'
Ross	 (entering) Hey!'
Rachel	 Hey Ross! Any word on the apartment yet?'
Ross	 Well, I called over there and it turns out Ugly Naked Guy is subletting it\nhimself and he's already had like a hundred applicants."
Rachel	 Oh.'
Ross	 No-no, I got the edge. I know it's not exactly ethical but I sent him a\nlittle bribe to "
Monica	 Oh, is it that pinball machine with the big bow on it?'
Ross	 No.'
Chandler	 That new mountain bike?'
Ross	 No.'
Monica	 Well what did you send?'
Ross	 A basket of mini-muffins.'
Phoebe	 But there's a whole table of mini-muffin baskets. Which one did you\nsend?"
Ross	 The small one.'
Rachel	 What?! You-you actually thought that basket was gonna get you the\napartment?'
Ross	 Well yeah! Someone sent us a basket at work once and people went crazy\nover those little muffins. It was the best day.'
Chandler	 Your work makes me sad.'
Ross	 Oh man! I want that place so much!! I was so sure that was gonna work!\nThere's twelve bucks I'll never see again! (Exits.)"
Rachel	 All right honey, we'd better go if we wanna catch that movie."
Monica	 Bye!'
All	 Bye!'
Phoebe	 Bye Chandler! (She walks up to him.) (Quietly.) I miss you already. (She\npinches his butt.)'
Chandler	 (after they've left) Okay, did you see that?! With the inappropriate\nand the pinching!!"
Monica	 Actually, I did!'
Chandler	 Okay, so now do you believe that she's attracted to me?"
Monica	 Ohhh, oh my God! Oh my God! She knows about us!'
Chandler	 Are you serious?'
Monica	 Phoebe knows and she's just trying to freak us out! That's the only\nexplanation for it!"
Chandler	 (a little hurt) Okay but what about y'know my pinchable butt and my\nbulging biceps\xc2\x97She knows!"

Chandler	 (entering) Joey!'
Joey	 Yeah?'
Chandler	 Phoebe knows about us!'
Joey	 Well I didn't tell them!"
Monica	 Them?! Who's them?"
Joey	 Uhhh, Phoebe and Joey.'
Monica	 Joey!'
Joey	 And Rachel. I would've told you but they made me promise not to tell!"
Chandler	 Oh man!'
Joey	 I'm sorry! But hey, it's over now, right? Because you can tell them that\nyou know they know and I can go back to knowing absolutely nothing!"
Monica	 Unless\xc2\x85'
Joey	 No! Not unless! Look this must end now!'
Monica	 Oh man, they think they are so slick messing with us! But see\nthey don't know that we know that they know! So\xc2\x85"
Chandler	 Ahh yes, the messers become the messies!'
Ross	 Noooo.'
Rachel	 Oh Ross, honey you gotta stop torturing yourself!'
Phoebe	 Yeah, why don't you just find another apartment?"
Ross	 Look I've already looked at like a thousand apartments this month and none\nof them even compares to that one!"
Rachel	 Y'know what you should do?"
Ross	 Huh?'
Rachel	 You should find out what his hobbies are and then use that to bond with\nhim. Yeah! Like if I would strike up a conversation about say umm, sandwiches. Or uh, or\nmy underwear.'
Joey	 I'm listening."
Rachel	 (To Ross) See?'
Ross	 That is a great idea! And! I know Ugly Naked Guy because we've been\nwatching him for like five years so that gives me back my edge! Oh, let's see now\nhe had the trampoline."
Phoebe	 He broke that.'
Ross	 Well, he had gravity boots.'
Rachel	 Yeah, he broke those too.'
Joey	 So he likes to break stuff.'
Ross	 Okay, I've got to go pick up Ben but I-I will figure something out. (He\nopens the door and stops.) Hey, didn't he used to have a cat?"
Phoebe	 I wouldn't bring that up, it would probably just bum him out."
Joey	 Yeah, poor cat, never saw that big butt coming.'
Ross	 Right. (Exits.)'
Rachel	 Hello! (Listens) Oh yeah! Hey! Hold on a second she's right here! (To\nPhoebe) It's Chandler."
Phoebe	 (in a sexy voice) Oh? (Takes the phone from Rachel.) Hello you.'
Chandler	 Hello Phoebe, I've been thinking about you all day. (He's holding the\nphone so that Monica can hear it as well.)"
Phoebe	 Eh?'
Chandler	 Well you know that thing you said before, I'd be lying if I said I\nwasn't intrigued."
Phoebe	 Really?'
Chandler	 Yeah, listen, Joey isn't gonna be here tonight so why don't you come\nover and I'll let you uh, feel my bicep. Or maybe more."
Phoebe	 I'll have to get back to you on that. Okay, bye! (Hangs up.) Oh my God!\nHe wants me to come over and feel his bicep and more!"
Rachel	 Are you kidding?!'
Phoebe	 No!'
Rachel	 I can not believe he would do that to Mon\xc2\x97Whoa! (She stops suddenly\nand slowly turns to point at Joey. Joey is avoiding her eyes.) Joey, do they know that we\nknow?'
Joey	 No.'
Rachel	 Joey!'
Joey	 They know you know.'
Rachel	 Ugh, I knew it! Oh I cannot believe those two!'
Phoebe	 God, they thought they can mess with us! They're trying to mess with\nus?! They don't know that we know they know we know! (Joey just shakes his head.) Joey,\nyou can't say anything!"
Joey	 I couldn't even if I wanted too."
Ross	 Good evening, sir. My name is Ross Geller. I'm one of the people who\napplied for the apartment. And I-I realize that the competition is fierce but\xc2\x97I'm\nsorry. I, I can't help but notice you're naked and (He claps his hands.) I applaud you.\nMan, I wish I was naked. I mean, this-this looks so great. That is how God intended it."
Monica	 (in the kitchen with Chandler) Look at them, they're-they're panicked!"
Chandler	 Oh yeah, they're totally gonna back down!"
Monica	 Oh yeah!'
Phoebe	 All right. All right! If he wants a date? He's gonna get a date. All\nright, I'm gonna go in."
Rachel	 All right. Be sexy.'
Phoebe	 (laughs) Please.'
Phoebe	 So Chandler, I-I'd love to come by tonight."
Chandler	 (initially worried, but gets over it) Really?'
Phoebe	 Oh absolutely. Shall we say, around seven?'
Chandler	 Yes.'
Phoebe	 Good. I'm really looking forward to you and me having sexual\nintercourse."
Joey	 (looking out the window) Hey-hey, check it out! Check it out! Ugly Naked\nGuy has a naked friend!'
Rachel	 Oh yeah! (She gasps.) Oh my God! That is our friend! (Monica\ncovers her face.) It's Naked Ross! (Monica turns and buries her face in Chandler's\nshoulder.)"
All	 Yeah, it is! Naked Ross!!'
Rachel	 Show time!'
Phoebe	 Okay, Rachel, get me perfume!'
Rachel	 Okay! (She runs to get some.)'
Phoebe	 And Joey, get me a bottle of wine and glasses? (He begrudgingly does\nso.)'
Monica	 All right, it'll be great! You just make her think you wanna have sex\nwith her! It'll totally freak her out!"
Chandler	 Okay, listen, how far am I gonna have to go with her?'
Monica	 Relax, she-she's gonna give in way before you do!"
Chandler	 How do you know?!'
Monica	 Because you're on my team! And my team always wins!"
Chandler	 At this?!'
Monica	 Just go get some! (Kisses him.) Go! (She runs to hide in the bathroom.)'
Rachel	 (handing her the wine) Okay honey, now I'm gonna try to listen from\nright here!"
Phoebe	 Okay.'
Rachel	 Okay? Whoa, wait! (She undoes one button on Phoebe's dress.)"
Phoebe	 Good idea! '
Rachel	 Yeah, oh wait! (She goes for another one.) '
Phoebe	 Oh now, don't give away the farm!"
Chandler	 Phoebe.'
Phoebe	 Chandler.'
Chandler	 Come on in.'
Phoebe	 I was going too. (They go inside and he closes the door.) Umm, I brought\nsome wine. Would you like some?'
Chandler	 Sure.'
Phoebe	 So, here we are. Nervous?'
Chandler	 Me? No. You?'
Phoebe	 No, I want this to happen.'
Chandler	 So do I.'
Chandler	 I'm gonna put on some music."
Phoebe	 Maybe, maybe I'll dance for you. (She starts doing a rather suggestive\nand seductive dance that's silly at the same time.)"
Chandler	 You look good.'
Phoebe	 Thanks! Y'know, that when you say things like that it makes me wanna rip\nthat sweater vest right off!"
Chandler	 Well, why don't we move this into the bedroom?"
Phoebe	 Really?'
Chandler	 Oh, do you not want to?'
Phoebe	 No. No! It's just y'know first, I wanna take off all my clothes and have\nyou rub lotion on me."
Chandler	 (swallowing hard) Well that would be nice. I'll go get the lotion."
Chandler	 Listen, this is totally getting out of hand! Okay? She wants me to put\nlotion on her! '
Monica	 She's bluffing!"
Chandler	 Look, she's not backing down! She went like this! (He does a little\nmimic of her dance.)"
Phoebe	 He's not backing down. He went to get lotion."
Joey	 (entering the hall) Oh man! Aren't you guys done yet?! I wanna sit in my\nchair!"
Rachel	 Joey look, just look at it this way, the sooner Phoebe breaks Chandler\nthe sooner this is all over and out in the open.'
Joey	 Ooh!'
Rachel	 Okay!'
Joey	 I like that! (To Phoebe) Oh, okay! Show him your bra! He's afraid of bras!\nCan't work 'em! (He swiftly rips open the front of Phoebe's dress revealing her bra.)"
Phoebe	 Joey! (Examining the dress.) Wow, you didn\xc2\x92t rip off any buttons.'
Joey	 It's not my first time."
Monica	 You go back out there and you seduce her till she cracks!'
Chandler	 Okay, give me a second! (Pause) Did you clean up in here?'
Monica	 Of course.'
Chandler	 Oh, you're-you're going?"
Phoebe	 Umm, not without you, lover. (She slowly walks over to him and is\nshowcasing her bra.) So, this is my bra.'
Chandler	 (swallowing hard) It's very, very nice. Well, come here. I'm very were\ngonna be having all the sex."
Phoebe	 You should be. I'm very bendy. (Pause) I'm gonna kiss you now."
Chandler	 Not if I kiss you first.'
Phoebe	 Ooh.'
Chandler	 Well, I guess there's nothing left for us to do but-but kiss."
Phoebe	 Here it comes. Our first kiss.'
Chandler	 Okay! Okay! Okay! You win! You win!! I can't have sex with ya!"
Phoebe	 And why not?!'
Chandler	 Because I'm in love with Monica!!"
Phoebe	 You're-you're what?!"
Chandler	 Love her! That's right, I\xc2\x85LOVE\xc2\x85HER!!! I love her!! (They\nwalk together and hug.) I love you, Monica."
Monica	 I love you too Chandler. (They kiss.)'
Phoebe	 I just\xc2\x97I thought you guys were doing it, I didn't know you were in\nlove!"
Joey	 Dude!'
Chandler	 And hats off to Phoebe. Quite a competitor. (Pause) And might I say\nyour breasts are still showing.'
Phoebe	 God! (She turns and buttons up.)'
Joey	 All right! So that's it! It's over! Everybody knows!"
Monica	 Well actually, Ross doesn't."
Chandler	 Yes, and we'd appreciate it if no one told him yet."

Ross	 A new place for a new Ross. I'm gonna have you and all the guys from work\nover once it's y'know, furnished."
Dr. Ledbetter	 I must say it's nice to see you back on your feet."
Ross	 Well I am that. And that whole rage thing is definitely behind me.'
Dr. Ledbetter	 I wonder if its time for you to rejoin our team at the museum?'
Ross	 Oh Donald that-that would be great. I am totally ready to come back to\nwork. I\xc2\x97What? (He notices something through the window.) No! Wh\xc2\x85 What are you\ndoing?!! (Dr. Ledbetter is slowly backing away.) GET OFF MY SISTER!!!!!!!!!!!!! '
