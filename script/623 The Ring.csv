Chandler	 Pheebs, can you help me pick out an engagement ring for Monica? I\ncan\xc2\x92t figure this out! It\xc2\x92s so hard! Should I get her a (turning to each page)\nTiffany cut or a Princess cut or a\xc2\x97ah-ah! Paper cut!'
Phoebe	 Now, have you told anyone else?'
Chandler	 No, I don\xc2\x92t want to tell anybody else because I don\xc2\x92t want\nMonica to find out.'
Phoebe	 You told me.'
Chandler	 Well, it\xc2\x92s because I trust you, you\xc2\x92re one of my best\nfriends, and you walked in on me when I was looking at ring brochures.'
Phoebe	 Yeah well, once again not knocking pays off. I only wish you hadn\xc2\x92t\nbeen on the toilet.'
Chandler	 Me too.'
Joey	 Hey. (Heads straight for the fridge.)'
Chandler	 Hey.'
Phoebe	 Hey! So Chandler, wanna go to the coffeehouse? '
Chandler	 Oh all right.'
Phoebe	 Yeah, coffeehouse.'
Ross	 Oh perfect, we were just gonna see if you wanted to go.'
Chandler	 Oh well, we don\xc2\x92t because we got\xc2\x85the\xc2\x85other pl-place.'
Ross	 How rude.'
Joey	 Oh, I\xc2\x92m sorry. You wanna bite? (Holds his piece out for him.)'

Phoebe	 So how are things going with Paul?'
Rachel	 Good. Although y\xc2\x92know, he-he\xc2\x92s a private guy. Y\xc2\x92know, I\nwish I could get him to open up a little bit, share some feelings.'
Phoebe	 That\xc2\x92s easy! You just have to think of him as a-as a jar of pickles\nthat won\xc2\x92t open.'
Rachel	 So what are you saying; I should run him under hot water and bang his\nhead against a table?'
Phoebe	 No that\xc2\x92s what you do when you want to get the truth out of\nsomeone.'
Paul	 (entering) Hi honey.'
Rachel	 Hi!'
Phoebe	 (To Rachel) Watch this.'
Paul	 (To Rachel) How are you?'
Rachel	 (To Phoebe) Okay.'
Phoebe	 Hi Paul!'
Paul	 Hi Phoebe.'
Phoebe	 So how are things going with you?'
Paul	 Can\xc2\x92t complain.'
Paul	 (whispering) Come on.'
Rachel	 Okay. (Gets up and starts to leave with Paul.)'
Paul	 (To Ross) Hey!'
Ross	 Hi!'
Paul	 Ross! '
Ross	 Great to see you!'
Paul	 Good to see you too!'
Ross	 How you doing?'
Paul	 Good. Bye! (Starts to leave.)'
Ross	 Okay! You take care! '
Ross	 Hey Pheebs, what-what was the deal with you and Chandler blowing us off\nbefore?'
Phoebe	 Yeah! That was so weird, huh?'
Ross	 Phoebe, why\xc2\x92d you do it?'
Phoebe	 I didn\xc2\x92t do it! It was Chandler! He\xc2\x92s\xc2\x85 He\xc2\x92s mad at\nyou!'
Ross	 What?! Why?!'
Phoebe	 Please, I think you know why.'
Ross	 I can\xc2\x92t think of anything.'
Phoebe	 Come on Ross, you\xc2\x92re a paleontologist, dig a little deeper.'
Ross	 Wait a minute, is it because Joey and I didn\xc2\x92t invite him to that\nKnicks game a couple of weeks ago?'
Phoebe	 Do you think that\xc2\x92s something that he\xc2\x92d be mad at you for?'
Ross	 I guess it could.'
Phoebe	 Well then I think that\xc2\x92s it.'
Ross	 Well, if he\xc2\x92s angry, he really shouldn\xc2\x92t just cover it up. I-I\nwish he would just tell me the truth.'
Phoebe	 Oh, if that\xc2\x92s what you want you then you really should run his head\nunder hot water and bang his head against a table.'
Paul	 Honey I made a reservation at China Garden, is that okay?'
Rachel	 Yeah that\xc2\x92s great. But first, wait, talk to me, talk to me. Tell me\nabout your day.'
Paul	 It was fine.'
Rachel	 Okay. Hey, what are you thinking? What are you thinking right now?'
Paul	 I\xc2\x92m thinking that you are looking really fine it that dress.'
Rachel	 Yeah that\xc2\x92s great Paul, but y\xc2\x92know I wanna know\nwhat\xc2\x97(Puts her hands on his shoulders)\xc2\x97Wow, those are really great! I just wanna\nknow what, what is behind this-this strong, silent exterior. Y\xc2\x92know they say that\nstill waters run deep and I wanna swim in yours.'
Paul	 Are you talking about having sex?'
Rachel	 No Paul, I don\xc2\x92t know anything about you! Y\xc2\x92know, like-like\nyour childhood! Tell me about your childhood!'
Paul	 Normal.'
Rachel	 Okay, well then how about puberty! Come on, that\xc2\x92s always a painful\ntime! Y\xc2\x92know your friends invite you to a slumber party and then they stick your hand\nin warm water while you\xc2\x92re sleeping so that you pee in your sleeping bag.'
Paul	 Nope! That never happened to me!'
Rachel	 Well, you\xc2\x92re lucky you never met that bitch Sharon Majesky. Anyway,\numm\xc2\x85 The rest of you life, y\xc2\x92know? Any regrets?'
Paul	 Nope.'
Rachel	 All right Paul, I\xc2\x92m not asking for a lot here. Okay? Just give me\nsomething. Anything!'
Paul	 Okay.'
Rachel	 Okay.'
Paul	 Okay.'
Rachel	 All right.'
Paul	 When I was six years old.'
Rachel	 Hm-mmm.'
Paul	 I wanted a big wheel. And instead my parents got me this little plastic\nchicken that you hop around on. It was embarrassing; kids made fun of me. That was a\npretty tough year.'
Rachel	 That\xc2\x92s-that\xc2\x92s great! See? I already feel like I know you a\nlittle better! Thank you. Okay, come on. Now we can go eat. Let\xc2\x92s go. (Gets up to\nleave, but Paul doesn\xc2\x92t move.)'
Paul	 It was horrible. They called me chicken boy.'
Rachel	 Oh!'
Paul	 And in fifth grade I got into a fight. Well, it wasn\xc2\x92t really a\nfight. Richard Darinvel bit me on the nose and, and I feel down. I still have a little\nscare right here (points to it) you can see it.'
Rachel	 Yeah. Yeah, I-I-I see the scare. Listen, Paul, I think this is really\ngreat that-that y\xc2\x92know, you shared your feelings. It\xc2\x92s really, it\xc2\x92s\nbeautiful, but umm, what do you say we go share some food?'
Paul	 Oh, I couldn\xc2\x92t eat now.'
Rachel	 What?! Wait! What are you talking about?! You love their Kung Pao\nChicken!'
Paul	 Chicken? (Pointing to himself.) Chicken boy!'
Rachel	 My God, I\xc2\x92m sorry! I\xc2\x92m sorry! I didn\xc2\x92t mean to do that! I\nwouldn\xc2\x92t do that!'
Chandler	 Nothin! This is the nine millionth ring store we\xc2\x92ve been too and\nI can\xc2\x92t find the perfect ring! (Goes over to another display counter and starts\npointing at rings.) Ugly ring! Ugly ring! Ugly ring! (Notices that one of the jewelers is\nwatching him.) It\xc2\x92s a beautiful selection. (The jeweler walks away slowly.)'
Phoebe	 Okay, so maybe you don\xc2\x92t get her a ring. Maybe you-maybe you do\nsomething different. Y\xc2\x92know? Maybe you get her an engagement bracelet, y\xc2\x92know?\nOr an engagement tiara? Or\xc2\x97ooh! An engagement Revolutionary War musket! (Picks one up\nfrom the display in the corner.'
Chandler	 Y\xc2\x92know, I\xc2\x92m so glad I picked you to help me with this.'
Phoebe	 Huh? Can you just imagine getting down on one knee and handing her this\ngorgeous piece of weaponry?'
Chandler	 Yeah, I\xc2\x92m gonna stick with the ring. (Goes to another display\ncounter.) Oh, this one\xc2\x92s nice! (Pointing to another ring.) I like this one! Sir? Uh,\nkind sir? Can I see this one?'
Phoebe	 (coming over after returning the musket) Wait a minute, no, this is,\nthis is the reason you brought me. Okay? I know how to haggle. So let me handle this from\nhere on out.'
Male Jeweler	 Can I help you?'
Chandler	 Uh-uh, yes. I would like to see that ring please.'
Phoebe	 Or not, whatever.'
Male Jeweler	 This ring is from the 1920s, it\xc2\x92s a one and a half carat\ndiamond with sapphires on either side.'
Chandler	 Sir, can I ask you to umm, could you\xc2\x85hold out that ring and ask\nme to marry you?'
Male Jeweler	 Okay. (Holds out the ring, deadpan.) Will you marry me?'
Chandler	 (choking up) Oh my God that\xc2\x92s it, that\xc2\x92s the ring! How much\nis it?'
Phoebe	 Chandler, I-I will handle this! (To the jeweler) How much is it?'
Male Jeweler	 8,600.'
Phoebe	 We will give you $10.'
Male Jeweler	 (angrily) Are you interested in this ring?!'
Chandler	 Yes! Yes, but I can only pay $8,000.'
Male Jeweler	 Okay, I can let it go at eight.'
Phoebe	 We stand firm at $10.'
Male Jeweler	 (ignoring her) How would you like to pay?'
Chandler	 Uh, credit card. (Reaches for it then realizes) Oh no! No-no, but I\nleft my credit card with Joey. (To Phoebe) Okay, I\xc2\x92ll go get it. You guard the ring.'
Phoebe	 Okay. (To the jeweler) Listen, I\xc2\x92m sorry about before. Do you have\nanything her for $10.'
Male Jeweler	 Uh yes, I have these two rather beautiful $5 bills. (Holds them up\nfrom his pocket.) '
Phoebe	 I\xc2\x92ll give you $1 for them.'
Ross	 Hey, remember how Chandler and Phoebe blew us off yesterday?'
Joey	 No.'
Ross	 Remember? You-you were eating pizza.'
Joey	 Yeah.'
Ross	 Okay. Well, apparently Chandler\xc2\x92s angry at us for not getting him a\nticket to that Knicks game a couple of weeks ago.'
Joey	 Oh, we\xc2\x92re supposed to just get him a ticket?! That guy is always\nmooching off of us!'
Ross	 Yeah! Anyway, I-I still think we should try to patch things up,\ny\xc2\x92know? Like uh, maybe we could get him to get tickets to another Knicks game and\ninvite him.'
Joey	 Oh wow that\xc2\x92s a great idea! And I still have his credit card.'
Gunther	 (handing them the bill) Here you go.'
Ross	 Oh. (Starts to get his money) '
Joey	 Hey-hey-hey-ho-ho, I got this one. Here you go. (Hands Gunther\nChandler\xc2\x92s card.) Y\xc2\x92know I gotta tell ya, sometimes I just\xc2\x97I don\xc2\x92t get\nChandler. Y\xc2\x92know, me and him do stuff all the time without you and you don\xc2\x92t get\nall upset.'
Ross	 All the time?'
Joey	 All the time!'
Rachel	 Oh my God! Oh my God!!'
Monica	 Still crying?'
Rachel	 Like a little girl. I know. I know. I know. This is all my fault;\nI wanted him to open up. But God, I didn\xc2\x92t know that I was gonna unleash this-this\nweepy, clingy, moist monster!'
Monica	 Y\xc2\x92know, I only know of two surefire ways to shut a man up. And one\nof them is sex.'
Rachel	 What\xc2\x92s the other one?'
Monica	 I don\xc2\x92t know, I\xc2\x92ve never had to use the other one. I\xc2\x92m\njust saying y\xc2\x92know, if we\xc2\x92re having sex, he\xc2\x92s not gonna be talking.'
Rachel	 Oh that\xc2\x92s right. You\xc2\x92re the talker. (They both reflect on that\nbriefly) Anyway uh, great idea! Umm, I gotta go to the store; I told him that I would buy\nhim some more tissues.'
Monica	 Oh, we have some\xc2\x85'
Rachel	 No you don\xc2\x92t!'
Phoebe	 Okay umm, I\xc2\x92d also like to try on the tiara. (The male jeweler\nhands it to her.) Oh yeah. Okay. (Puts it on.) (To the jeweler) What do you think, too\nmuch?'
Male Jeweler	 A tad.'
Phoebe	 Okay. Then, take the tiara back and let me hold the musket again. (He\nhands it to her and Phoebe poses in front of one of those small mirrors.) Something\xc2\x92s\nmissing. It\xc2\x92s not\xc2\x85 Okay oh, let me see the ring my friend picked out.'
Male Jeweler	 (to the female jeweler) Where\xc2\x92s the 1920s princess cut ring.'
Female Jeweler	 I just sold it to that gentleman. (Points to the one walking out\nthe store.)'
Phoebe	 Oh my God!! (She runs after him, but sets of the security system, which\nlocks the store\xc2\x92s door and brings down a set of bars behind her, caging her in.) No!\nWhat?! Help me! Let me out! Now! (Points the musket at them.)'

Paul	 Rachel?'
Chandler	 No. How are ya Paul? (Starts to look for his credit card.)'
Paul	 (acting manly to try and cover up his crying) Okay. Chandler, did your dad\never hug you?'
Chandler	 No, did he hug you?!'
Paul	 No! No! It\xc2\x92s just that, my dad never did. I miss my dad.'
Chandler	 Well, you can see my dad in Vegas kissing other dads.'
Paul	 Hey Chandler?'
Chandler	 Yeah?'
Paul	 Would you\xc2\x85\xc2\x85.Would you hug me?'
Chandler	 I\xc2\x92m a little busy here Paul.'
Paul	 That\xc2\x92s exactly what my dad used to say! (Starts to breakdown again.)'
Chandler	 Okay, a quick one. Come on hug it out. (Paul rushes over and hugs\nChandler tightly.) Oh hey! There you go. (The hug continues.) Okay. (The hug continues.)'
Paul	 Five more seconds.'
Chandler	 Okay! (Pushes him away.)'
Joey	 (entering) Hey!'
Paul	 Joey! (Goes over and hugs Joey and picks him off of his feet.)'
Joey	 Whoa-whoa-hey-hey! (Motions to Chandler, "What\xc2\x92s going\non?") Hi, Paul is it? (Paul nods yes and still hugging Joey.)'
Chandler	 Do you have my credit card?'
Joey	 Yes, it\xc2\x92s in my\xc2\x85 In\xc2\x85in my pocket. (Paul hasn\xc2\x92t dropped\nhim yet.) (Chandler starts to reach for his front pocket.) My back pocket! My back pocket!'
Chandler	 Thank God! (Grabs his card.)'
Joey	 Oh hey listen I got us tickets to a Knicks game tonight.'
Chandler	 Oh, I can\xc2\x92t go.'
Joey	 Come on! It\xc2\x92ll be fun! Me, you, and Ross, and\xc2\x85 Paul\nprobably\xc2\x85'
Phoebe	 Chandler, I found the perfect ring. (Holding it out for her.)'
Chandler	 Oh, that\xc2\x92s uh, that\xc2\x92s pretty nice but I\xc2\x92m gonna go with\nthe one I picked first.'
Phoebe	 Oh my God Chandler, the one you picked is gone. It\xc2\x92s over!'
Chandler	 What?'
Phoebe	 Some guy bought it. I\xc2\x92m sorry. I tired to stop it but they (points\nto the jeweler) put me in jail!'
Chandler	 They put you in jail?'
Phoebe	 The little jail between the doors!'
Chandler	 Phoebe, I asked you to guard the ring!'
Phoebe	 I know, I\xc2\x92m sorry! But y\xc2\x92know, this ring is better! Monica\nnever even saw the other ring.'
Chandler	 Yeah but when he proposed to me with the ring I got goose bumps.'
Phoebe	 Maybe it was the guy.'
Chandler	 It was the ring!'
Ross	 Hey! So uh, was he excited about the tickets?'
Joey	 No! He blew us off!'
Ross	 What?!'
Joey	 I know!'
Ross	 I can\xc2\x92t believe it. (Pause) Can I tell you something? I\xc2\x92m a\nlittle mad at him now.'
Joey	 Can I tell you something? Me too.'
Ross	 Y\xc2\x92know what? He didn\xc2\x92t want to talk to us about being angry,\nwell maybe we don\xc2\x92t talk to him at all!'
Joey	 Ooooh! Freeze him out.'
Ross	 That\xc2\x92s right!'
Joey	 I like it!'
Ross	 Eh? We\xc2\x92ll show him!'
Joey	 From now on, it\xc2\x92s gonna be Joey and Ross, best friends. (They shake\nhands.) Okay! We\xc2\x92re gonna be the new Joey and Chandler.'
Rachel	 Hi. I\xc2\x92m back.'
Paul	 Hey! I have so much more to tell ya, I\xc2\x92ve written it all down!'
Rachel	 Ah that\xc2\x92s great. No actually that\xc2\x92s\xc2\x85 (In a sexy voice)\nThat\xc2\x92s great! That\xc2\x92s really great! Y\xc2\x92know, I gotta tell ya writing, I mean\nwriting, gets me uh, gets me kinda hot.'
Paul	 Wait! Wait! Listen! Listen to this! (Flips a couple pages and points to\nsomething.) Y\xc2\x92know what I wanted to be when I was that age?'
Rachel	 A lover?'
Paul	 A surfer.'
Rachel	 Oh yeah surfer?'
Paul	 I wanted to be one with the waves, y\xc2\x92know?'
Rachel	 Okay, hold on real quick, hold on a second let me just uh, (sits on the\ncounter and buttons her sweater to show some cleavage) get a little more comfortable here.\nWait, now wait a second, this isn\xc2\x92t too revealing is it?'
Paul	 (barely glancing at her) No. What ever happened to that little dude.\n(Pause) So full of dreams\xc2\x85'
Rachel	 I don\xc2\x92t care about the little dude! I can\xc2\x92t! I cannot listen\nto anymore of this! Y\xc2\x92know, the only person who would want to listen to this is a\nmental health professional! And then it\xc2\x92s only because they get paid $100 an hour! Do\nyou know how much money I could\xc2\x92ve made listening to you? $2,000! And do you know\nwhen I figured that out? While you were talking!'
Paul	 What?! I can\xc2\x92t believe you\xc2\x92re trying to stifle me! When just 14\nhours ago we figured out that that is exactly what my mother was trying to do to me!'
Rachel	 Oh\xc2\x85 I\xc2\x92m sorry. I\xc2\x85 I-I don\xc2\x92t mean\xc2\x97I didn\xc2\x92t\nmean to stifle you. I\xc2\x85 This is all just a little overwhelming.'
Paul	 Oh Rachel, I\xc2\x92m so sorry. I didn\xc2\x92t mean to overwhelm you.\nIt\xc2\x92s just that, when those gates open, you\xc2\x85 (Starts to breakdown.) Hard to close\n\xc2\x91em. But they are closed now. Believe me.'
Rachel	 I\xc2\x92m so glad, I\xc2\x92m so glad you shared. (Feeling his shoulder.)\nAnd I\xc2\x92m glad that you\xc2\x92re done. What do you say we umm\xc2\x85 (Nods in the\ndirection of the bedroom.)'
Paul	 I would really like that. (They kiss.)'
Paul	 That was\xc2\x85so good. (Starts crying again.)'
Phoebe	 (entering from her room) Hey.'
Chandler	 I can\xc2\x92t believe I let you talk me into buying this stupid gumball\nmachine looking ring!'
Phoebe	 It\xc2\x92s not a stupid gumball machine looking ring! It\xc2\x92s a\nbeautiful ring!'
Chandler	 No, it\xc2\x92s not! When I looked at the other ring I could see\nMonica\xc2\x92s face when I gave it to her, y\xc2\x92know? And I could see her saying yes.\nWhen I look at this ring, all I see is a ring! Unless I look at it really closely and then\nI can see my own eye. (Does so and laughs.) Look, this is the most important thing\nI\xc2\x92m gonna do in my life. I wanna make sure it\xc2\x92s perfect.'
Phoebe	 Okay. There may be a way that we can get the other ring back.\n\xc2\x91Cause I heard the guy tell the jeweler where he was going to propose. So maybe we\ncan get him to trade rings or something.'
Chandler	 I can\xc2\x92t do that.'
Phoebe	 Well you certainly can\xc2\x92t give her that stupid gumball ring.'
Phoebe	 There he is! (Points.)'
Chandler	 Okay and he hasn\xc2\x92t proposed yet because she has no ring on her\nfinger.'
Phoebe	 Wow! You\xc2\x92re good! After this, we should solve crimes.'
Chandler	 Yeah! Okay, go, go, go get him.'
Phoebe	 Oh, okay. (Walks over to him.) Excuse me sir? Could you come with me\nplease? You have a phone call.'
Customer	 Who is it?'
Phoebe	 It is your office.'
Customer	 Do you know who at my office?'
Phoebe	 John?'
Customer	 Oh John! Great!'
Phoebe	 (To Chandler) Here he is.'
Chandler	 (to him) Hi! Hi. Okay, there was a slight mix-up at the jewelry store,\nthe ring you\xc2\x92re about to propose with was supposed to be held for me. So, I\xc2\x92m\ngonna need to have that back. (The guy isn\xc2\x92t sure.) But, in exchange I\xc2\x92m willing\nto trade you this beautiful, more expensive ring. (Looking at the ring.) Ew.'
Phoebe	 Wow! I would trade.'
Customer	 It is beautiful, but I\xc2\x92m gonna use this one. Now, if you\xc2\x92ll\nexcuse me.'
Chandler	 No-no! This is my fiancee (Phoebe) and her heart was set on that ring.\nYou don\xc2\x92t want to break her heart now do you?'
Phoebe	 Yeah, do you want to break a dying woman\xc2\x92s heart?'
Customer	 You\xc2\x92re dying?!'
Chandler	 Yeah, she\xc2\x92s dying\xc2\x85 Of a cough apparently.'
Phoebe	 Yes, and it is my dying wish to have that ring. See, if I\xc2\x92m not\nburied with that ring then my spirit is going to wander the nether world for all\neternity\xc2\x85'
Chandler	 (interrupting her) Okay, that\xc2\x92s enough honey!'
Customer	 I don\xc2\x92t know. (Pause) Let me see the ring.'
Chandler	 Great! Okay, here. (Holds the ring up for him.)'
Customer	 (looks at it) All right. (Exchanges rings.)'
Chandler	 Thank you. Thank you. Thank you! (To his girlfriend) And you\nare about to marry a wonderful man! (She stunned and he\xc2\x92s horrified.) Hey! I\xc2\x92m\nmarrying a dead woman!'
Chandler	 Guys? (They ignore him.) I\xc2\x92ve got something important to tell ya.\n(Still nothing so he walks over and stands in front of the TV.) Guys? (They lean over to\ntry and watch the TV, Chandler mimics them.) Guys?! (Pause) I\xc2\x92m gonna ask Monica to\nmarry me.'
Joey	 (To Ross) I think we gotta end the freeze out.'
Ross	 Wait a minute, is this, is this for real?'
Chandler	 Yeah, check out the ring. (Shows it to them.)'
Joey	 Oh my God!!'
Ross	 So you two are really serious?!'
Chandler	 Yep, pretty much.'
Ross	 You-you\xc2\x92re gonna get married?! I mean\xc2\x85 We\xc2\x92re gonna be\nbrothers-in-law! (They hug.)'
Joey	 And-and-and-and-and-and, and we\xc2\x92re gonna be friends again! '
Chandler	 (goes to hug him and stops short) Heyyyy\xc2\x97What?'
Joey	 Oh it\xc2\x92s water under the bridge, forget it!'
Chandler	 Okay! (They hug.) I was gonna wait \xc2\x91til uh, it was official\ny\xc2\x92know? But I got so excited I just had to tell you guys because you\xc2\x92re my best\nfriends.'
Joey	 I think I\xc2\x92m gonna cry!'
Rachel	 (who has just entered) Ugh! No more crying! Please! I just dumped one\ncry baby, I\xc2\x92ll dump you too!'
Chandler	 I\xc2\x92m gonna ask Monica to marry me.'
Rachel	 Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh Chandler!! (Hugs him.) You guys are gonna be so\nhappy!'
Chandler	 I know.'
Joey	 (holding an empty tissue box) Where\xc2\x92s all the tissues?! (Throws the\nbox down in disgust.)'

Chandler	 Check out the ring.'
Rachel	 (gasps) Nice! One and a half carat easy.'
Phoebe	 (entering) Hi.'
Ross	 Hey-hey Pheebs!'
Phoebe	 What?'
Ross	 Chandler\xc2\x92s gonna ask Monica to marry him!'
Phoebe	 Oh I know, I helped pick out the ring.'
Ross	 You told her before you told us?'
Chandler	 Well, she walked in when I was looking at the ring brochures. You can\nunderstand that, right? (Ross and Joey look at each other and go back to watching the game\non TV.) Guys? Guys? (Walks in front of them again.)'
