Phoebe	 Hey!'
Monica	 Hey how was dinner?!'
Phoebe	 Dinner was good! '
Monica	 Okay!'
Phoebe	 I\xc2\x92m just saying hi! Now I\xc2\x92m gonna go! '
Monica	 Okay!'
Phoebe	 (To him) Oh, well hello there.'
Guy	 Hi.'
Phoebe	 (To Monica) I didn\xc2\x92t see this on the menu.'
Monica	 Uh Tim? This is Phoebe. Phoebe this is Tim, my new sous chef.'
Phoebe	 Oh, so you're Monica\xc2\x92s boss?"
Tim	 Actually she\xc2\x92s my-my boss. Sous is French for under.'
Phoebe	 Oh! I sous stand.'
Monica	 Hey Tim? I need a calamari and a Caesar salad. And umm, could you get me\nthe pesto?'
Tim	 Yeah.'
Phoebe	 Oh you\xc2\x85you made pesto?'
Tim	 Yes I did.'
Phoebe	 Would you say your pesto is the best-o?'
Tim	 I\xc2\x85I-I don\xc2\x92t know, but I would say it\xc2\x92s pretty good-o.\n(Phoebe laughs too hard.)'
Monica	 All right, I still need a calamari and a Caesar salad.'
Tim	 I like your necklace.'
Phoebe	 I made it myself.'
Tim	 You are so talented.'
Phoebe	 Well, it\xc2\x92s no pesto.'
Monica	 All right, all right! Let\xc2\x92s just cut to the chase, okay? (To\nPhoebe) You\xc2\x92re single. (To Tim) You\xc2\x92re single. (To Phoebe) He gets off work at\neleven. (To Tim) She\xc2\x92ll be waiting for your call. (To Phoebe) I\xc2\x92ll give him your\nnumber if I can get one calamari and one Caesar salad!! (Everyone in the kitchen stops.) I\ndid not yell. I am not putting a dollar in the jar.'

Mr. Franklin	 Wow Bing! Burning the midnight oil.'
Chandler	 You know me sir. Oh ah, I do have a question for ya. Do you know how I\nget around the office computer network so I can access the really good Internet porn?'
Mr. Franklin	 You\xc2\x92re a joker Bing. (Walks away.)'
Chandler	 What\xc2\x92s funny about that?'
Ross	 (running up) Hey! Sorry I kept you waiting so long.'
Chandler	 Hey that\xc2\x92s okay. So, where do you want to go?'
Ross	 Oh ah, I think you know where I want to go.'
Chandler	 The Hard Rock Caf\xc3\xa9?'
Ross	 Yeah!'
Chandler	 Again?!'
Ross	 Yeah!!'
Ross	 I\xc2\x92m telling you, I like the food!'
Chandler	 You like the Purple Rain display! (A guy walks up.) Hey Bob.'
Bob	 Hey Toby! Have a good night. (Walks by.)'
Ross	 Did that guy just call you Toby?'
Chandler	 Yeah, he thinks that\xc2\x92s my name.'
Ross	 Well, why don\xc2\x92t you correct him?'
Chandler	 Oh it\xc2\x92s been going on way to long now. Y\xc2\x92know, I mean the\nfirst time he said it we were just passing each other in the hallway, so I didn\xc2\x92t say\nanything. And then the next time he said, "Hey Toby, do you want a donut?" And\nI-I wanted a donut. And now it\xc2\x92s five years later, the donut\xc2\x92s gone and I\xc2\x92m\nstill Toby.'
Ross	 Five years?! Chandler you have to tell him!'
Chandler	 No! That would be so awkward! Look\xc2\x97Besides, we work in different\ndepartments. He\xc2\x92s on the sixth floor y\xc2\x92know? So he calls me Toby once in a\nwhile. What\xc2\x92s the big deal? It could be worse, it\xc2\x92s not like he\xc2\x92s calling\nme Muriel. (Chandler suddenly freezes into place.)'
Ross	 (laughs) Muriel. Wh-why would he call you Muriel? (Ross realizes\nsomething.) Oh my God! Chandler M Bing? It\xc2\x92s not just an M, your middle name\nis Muriel!!'
Chandler	 Shh! It is a family name!'
Ross	 Chandler Muriel Bing. Boy, your parents never gave you a chance did they?'
Joey's Co-Star	 Drake, I\xc2\x92ve discovered the reason for all your headaches\nand memory loss."
Dr. Drake Ramoray	 What is it?'
Joey's Co-Star	 Apparently your brain transplant was not entirely successful. It\nseems your body is rejecting Jessica\xc2\x92s brain."
Dr. Drake Ramoray	 Is it serious?'
Joey's Co-Star	 Not if we extract tissue from the original host body, synthesize\nantibodies, and introduce them into your system, which could stop it from rejecting the\nbrain."
Dr. Drake Ramoray	 Well that sounds simple enough, let\xc2\x92s just do that.'
Joey's Co-Star	 We would, but when we went to exhume Jessica\xc2\x92s body, it was\ngone."
Director	 Cut! Very nice people!'
Joey	 (To Rachel) Okay, let me just get changed and we can go to dinner.'
Rachel	 Well don\xc2\x92t\xc2\x97What happened to Jessica\xc2\x92s body?!'
Joey	 I\xc2\x92m not telling, you\xc2\x92ll have to see it on TV!'
Rachel	 You don\xc2\x92t know do you?'
Joey	 No, couldn\xc2\x92t care less.'
Joey's Co-Star	 Hey good scene man."
Joey	 Hey you too!'
Joey's Co-Star	 Alright."
Joey	 What? You weren\xc2\x92t in it.'
Rachel	 Oh! (Motions to Joey\xc2\x92s co-star.)'
Joey	 Oh sorry. Uh-uh, Kash?'
Kash	 Yes?'
Joey	 This is my friend Rachel. Rachel, Kash, Kash, Rachel.'
Rachel	 Hi.'
Kash	 Hey! How come I haven\xc2\x92t seen you here before?'
Rachel	 Well, Joey probably thinks I\xc2\x92ll just embarrass him. Y\xc2\x92know, he\nthinks I\xc2\x92m some kind of a soap opera nut\xc2\x97Which I\xc2\x92m not! I\xc2\x92m not.\nAlthough I do know that your uh, your favorite ice cream flavor is butter pecan. (Starts\nstroking his arm) And uh, and that your-your dog\xc2\x92s name is Wally. Well look at that,\nI\xc2\x92m just stroking your arm.'
Joey	 (grabbing her) Here we go! Here we go! (Starts to pull her away from\nKash.)'
Rachel	 Oh, we\xc2\x92re leaving. Bye Kash.'
Kash	 Bye.'
Rachel	 Say hi to Wally.'
Phoebe	 Ooh Monica!'
Monica	 Hi!'
Phoebe	 Oh my God! I had the best time with Tim last night. He is so\nsweet! Oh, I can\xc2\x92t wait to get sous-neath him.'
Monica	 I\xc2\x85I have to fire him.'
Phoebe	 But why?!'
Monica	 Because he\xc2\x92s terrible! Okay, he\xc2\x92s slow, he burns things, last\nnight he lit my pastry chef on fire!'
Phoebe	 Well maybe he was just nervous, y\xc2\x92know you can be very\nintimidating. And besides I\xc2\x92ve met your pastry chef and she can stand to be taken\ndown a peg or two.'
Monica	 Well, now she has no eyebrows, mission accomplished.'
Phoebe	 But Monica, he loves his job so much! Can you just give him another\nchance? Please?'
Monica	 (thinks about it) All right, but if-if he lights someone else on fire he\nis out of there!'
Phoebe	 That\xc2\x92s fair! Thank you so much. Thanks. Oops, it looks like when he\ngot the pastry chef he got you a little bit too.'
Monica	 I paid to have this done.'
Phoebe	 Love it!'
Joey	 Hey!'
Rachel	 Hi!'
Joey	 Oh you know uh Kash, really liked you the other day. He said he thought\nyou were charming.'
Rachel	 I thought I was a complete idiot.'
Joey	 Hey, I\xc2\x92m with you. He even asked me if I thought you\xc2\x92d go out\nwith him.'
Rachel	 Oh! Oh, I think I\xc2\x92m gonna throw up a little bit. What did you say?'
Joey	 I said no.'
Rachel	 What?!'
Joey	 What? I\xc2\x85I just figured since you\xc2\x92re pregnant you\xc2\x92re not\ngonna be seeing people.'
Rachel	 Okay Joey, first of all Kash Ford is not people. Second of all, what did\nhe say when you told him I was pregnant?'
Joey	 I didn\xc2\x92t tell him. I didn\xc2\x92t know if you were telling people.\nThis is back when I thought Kash was still people.'
Rachel	 Good-good, don\xc2\x92t tell him. Don\xc2\x92t tell him. Just have him call\nme okay?'
Joey	 Rach look, I really don\xc2\x92t think that\xc2\x92s such a great\xc2\x85'
Rachel	 Okay, you go do it! I\xc2\x92ll come back to that set! I\xc2\x92ll meet more\nactors! I\xc2\x92ll meet \xc2\x91em all!'
Chandler	 Hey Bob.'
Bob	 Hey! How\xc2\x92s my pal Toby doing today?'
Chandler	 If I see him, I\xc2\x92ll ask.'
Bob	 (laughs) Toby!'
Mr. Franklin	 Hey-hey! Bing? Was that Bob from six you were just talking too?'
Chandler	 Yeah!'
Mr. Franklin	 Oh then you know each other.'
Chandler	 We\xc2\x92re on a semi-first name basis.'
Mr. Franklin	 What do you think of adding him to our team?'
Chandler	 Bob? Ooh, working here with us? Everyday? Yeah, I don\xc2\x92t know if\nhe has what it takes.'
Mr. Franklin	 Really? They love him down on six.'
Chandler	 But this is eleven. It\xc2\x92s almost twice as hard up here.'
Mr. Franklin	 Okay, I hear you loud and clear. Bob will stay put.'
Chandler	 I think it\xc2\x92s best sir.'
Mr. Franklin	 But we really do need to find someone up here. The work is\nstarting to pile up. I\xc2\x92ve got a stack of documents on my desk this high. (Holds his\nhand at shoulder level.) '
Chandler	 Y\xc2\x92know what you should do, just toss \xc2\x91em in the shedder and\nclaim you never got \xc2\x91em.'
Mr. Franklin	 (laughs) That\xc2\x92s a good one. (Walks away.)'
Chandler	 What does a guy have to do to be taken seriously around\nhere?!'
Phoebe	 Hey!'
Monica	 Hey. Okay, I gave him another chance, but Tim has got to go!'
Phoebe	 But\xc2\x85'
Monica	 No! No-no! He is totally incompetent. I called the chef who recommended\nhim to me. He said, "Ha-ha! Gotcha!"'
Phoebe	 Okay. Okay, but you can\xc2\x92t fire him today.'
Monica	 Why not?!'
Phoebe	 Because I\xc2\x92m dumping him today.'
Monica	 What?! You said he was sweet!'
Phoebe	 He is sweet. He\xc2\x92s too sweet. He calls me all the time.\n(Mimicking him) "So did-did you get home from work okay?" "Did-did you get\nout of the shower okay?"'
Monica	 Just don\xc2\x92t pick up your phone.'
Phoebe	 Then he comes over! (Mimicking him) "I\xc2\x92m so worried about\nyou." Uck! Be a man!'
Monica	 What? So now I\xc2\x92m not allowed to fire him?'
Phoebe	 You can\xc2\x92t fire him and dump him the same day, he\xc2\x92ll kill\nhimself.'
Monica	 Okay well then, I\xc2\x92ll fire him today and you go out with him for\nanother week.'
Phoebe	 Are you kidding?! Another week with that sip, I\xc2\x92ll kill myself!'
Monica	 Okay well, then we\xc2\x92ll both do it today and he\xc2\x92ll just have to\ndeal with it!'
Phoebe	 Okay. But the question is who\xc2\x92s gonna go first. \xc2\x91Cause whoever\ngoes second is the bitch.'
Monica	 What do you mean?'
Phoebe	 Come on! The boss that fires a guy that\xc2\x92s just been dumped, bitch!\nAnd the woman who dumps a guy that\xc2\x92s just been fired, blond bitch!'
Monica	 I wanted to do this days ago so I think I should go first.'
Phoebe	 All right, that makes sense. (Starts towards the door.) Ugh.\nBut\xc2\x97Screw you I\xc2\x92m going first! (She grabs her purse and runs out.)'
Bob	 Hey Toby, you got a sec?'
Chandler	 Sure, what\xc2\x92s up?'
Bob	 I just had a meeting, I was actually hoping to get transferred up here, but\nI just found out its not gonna happen. Apparently somebody thinks I\xc2\x92m not eleventh\nfloor material. Say uh, who the hell is this Chandler?'
Rachel	 Hey, what do you think is a better excuse for why I\xc2\x92m not drinking\non this date tonight. "Umm, I\xc2\x92m a recovering alcoholic. I\xc2\x92m a Mormon,"\nor "I got so hammered last night I\xc2\x92m still a little drunk?"'
Ross	 (entering with a pizza and beer) Hey!'
Rachel	 Hi!'
Joey	 Hey!'
Ross	 So, what do you want to do tonight? There\xc2\x92s a Ukrainian film at the\nAngelica that\xc2\x92s supposed to be very powerful. Interested?'
Joey	 No. No. But I\xc2\x92ll go see a normal person movie with ya.'
Ross	 Rach? You wanna come?'
Rachel	 Oh no, I can\xc2\x92t. I got a date.'
Ross	 A date?'
Rachel	 Yeah. Why? Is that weird for you?'
Ross	 Why no, it\xc2\x92s the opposite of weird. It\xc2\x92s-it\xc2\x92s uh, regular.\nIt\xc2\x92s-it\xc2\x92s uh, it\xc2\x92s mundane. It\xc2\x92s actually uh, a little dull.'
Joey	 It\xc2\x92s no Ukrainian film.'
Rachel	 Yeah\xc2\x97Ooh! Earrings! (Goes into her room.)'
Ross	 A date?! She\xc2\x92s-she\xc2\x92s got a date?! With who?'
Joey	 I set her up with this actor on my show.'
Ross	 You set her up?!'
Joey	 No'
Ross	 Joey what-what were you thinking?!'
Joey	 Well, I was thinking that it\xc2\x92d probably be okay because Ross\nhasn\xc2\x92t gone out with Rachel in five years!'
Ross	 Joey, I\xc2\x92m not worried about her! I\xc2\x92m worried about my baby!\nWhoever she dates my baby dates! Now-now where is this (makes the quote-marks sign) actor\ntaking them?'
Joey	 Hey! I\xc2\x92m an (does the quote-marks thing as well) actor too! I\xc2\x92m\nnot sure. I think they\xc2\x92re taking the ferry out to some Italian place on Staten\nIsland.'
Ross	 A ferry? My baby is going on a ferry? Do you have any idea how dangerous\nthose are?!'
Joey	 Are we talking about one of those big boats that carry cars that go like\nfive miles an hour?'
Ross	 Why don\xc2\x92t they just jump out of an airplane?! Huh?! That-that\xc2\x92s\na fun date! Or burn each other with matches?! That\xc2\x92s fun too! Whew!!'
Kash	 Hey Joey.'
Joey	 Hey Kash. Uh hey-hey this is Ross. Ross, this is Kash.'
Kash	 Hey.'
Ross	 Hi. I-I hear you\xc2\x92re going on a ferry tonight.'
Kash	 Yeah.'
Ross	 A bit of a daredevil are we?'
Rachel	 (entering from her room) Hey guys do you think this is too\nslutty\xc2\x97Hi Kash!'
Kash	 Hey Rachel! You ready to go?'
Rachel	 Yeah! All right, I\xc2\x92ll see you guys later.'
Ross	 Okay. Have a great time you guys.'
Rachel	 Thank you.'
Kash	 Thank you.'
Ross	 Yes it is too slutty! (Joey slams the door before Rachel could hear the\nentire sentence.)'

Tim	 (walks behind Phoebe) Hi! (And startles her.)'
Phoebe	 Hi.'
Tim	 Oh, I\xc2\x92m so glad you called. I feel like it\xc2\x92s always me calling\nyou. So, what\xc2\x92s up? Is everything okay with Phoebe?'
Phoebe	 It will be\xc2\x85in a minute. Listen, Tim you\xc2\x92re a really great guy.'
Tim	 It\xc2\x92s because I\xc2\x92m with you.'
Phoebe	 Aw. (Phoebe gets a bad taste in her mouth when he looks away) I\xc2\x92m\njust\xc2\x97I\xc2\x92m in a place in my life right now where I\xc2\x85I\xc2\x85'
Tim	 Whoops. Sorry. (Looking at it, like a newscaster) This just in. (Phoebe\nfake laughs.) Oh, it\xc2\x92s 9-1-1 from the restaurant, that means Monica needs me right\naway. (Starts to leave.)'
Phoebe	 Oh-oh no she doesn\xc2\x92t! I know what that is. You can stay.'
Tim	 Awww, I\xc2\x92ll miss you too Pheebs. (Starts to leave) And I will be\nholding you, right here. (Holds his hands over his heart, blows a kiss to Phoebe who\ncatches it, and then leaves and Phoebe throws the kiss back.)'
Joey	 So what movie do you want to see\xc2\x97And not another one I have to read.\nOkay? I get enough of that from books.'
Ross	 Books?'
Joey	 All right, car magazines, cereal boxes, but it\xc2\x92s like enough!'
Ross	 Well, I tell you what. Why don\xc2\x92t we uh, why don\xc2\x92t we just stay\nhere? Let\xc2\x92s not see a movie, we\xc2\x92ll just hang.'
Joey	 And just wait for Rachel to come back from her date?'
Ross	 Hey, if that\xc2\x92s what you want to do I\xc2\x92m not gonna say no.'
Joey	 Dude! What is going on?!'
Ross	 I just\xc2\x85I have to find out how it went.'
Joey	 Why?'
Ross	 This guy could be my baby\xc2\x92s stepfather!'
Joey	 They go on one date and you\xc2\x92re worried about them getting married?!\nHe\xc2\x92s not you!'
Ross	 I just\xc2\x97I-I can\xc2\x92t believe she\xc2\x92s-she\xc2\x92s dating?!'
Joey	 Well Ross, what did you think she was gonna do?'
Ross	 I don\xc2\x92t know! I guess I just can\xc2\x92t believe any of this is\nhappening.'
Joey	 What do you mean?'
Ross	 It\xc2\x92s just I always thought when I had another kid it would be\ndifferent. Now I-I love Ben, but every time I have to drop him off at Carol and\nSusan\xc2\x92s, it\xc2\x92s like\xc2\x97It breaks my heart a little. I mean I\xc2\x92ve always had\nthis picture of me and my next wife in bed on Sunday and, my kid comes running in and\nleaps up onto the bed. And we all read the paper together. Y\xc2\x92know? Maybe fight over\nthe science section.'
Joey	 That\xc2\x92s a nice picture. Maybe you can still have that!'
Ross	 No! No I can\xc2\x92t. I mean Rachel\xc2\x92s out with some guy. My baby went\nwith her. If anything that picture keeps moving further away.'
Joey	 Hey, can I ask you something? In this, in this picture of you and your\nwife, is your wife Rachel?'
Ross	 It used to be. Now she doesn\xc2\x92t really have a face. Smokin\xc2\x92 body\nthough.'
Joey	 Good call. Yeah. But, the face Ross, the face isn\xc2\x92t Rachel.'
Ross	 No but ahh! How much easier would it be if it were?'
Joey	 I know, but I don\xc2\x92t think that\xc2\x92s what she wants.'
Ross	 No, it\xc2\x92s not what I want either. I mean I-I can\xc2\x92t force myself\nto fall in love with her again now.'
Joey	 That\xc2\x92s okay Ross maybe you need a new picture. Okay? It\xc2\x92s not\ngonna be what you thought, but no matter what there\xc2\x92s gonna be a brand new little\nbaby, your baby. Who cares what the picture looks like?'
Ross	 Yeah.'
Joey	 Hey, I tell you what. Let\xc2\x92s you and me go out and have some fun. Huh?\nWhatever you want. Come on!'
Ross	 (checks his watch) We can still catch that Ukrainian film.'
Joey	 No, I said fun!'
Bob	 Hey Toby!'
Chandler	 Hey Bobby.'
Bob	 It\xc2\x92s Bob actually. Hey, you work up here, can you tell me where this\nChandler Bing\xc2\x92s office is?'
Chandler	 Uhh yeah. Yeah, it\xc2\x92s (Points down the hall) right, right down\nthere. (When he has Bob looking down the hall, he turns around and knocks his nameplate\noff of his door.) Right there, yeah. Can I ask you why?'
Bob	 I want to talk to that bastard, see what his problem is.'
Chandler	 Okay Bob listen uhh, I\xc2\x92m the reason you didn\xc2\x92t get the job\nup here.'
Bob	 Toby don\xc2\x92t.'
Chandler	 Bob!'
Bob	 Toby! I\xc2\x92m not gonna let you cover for him. Anything you say right now\nwill just get me more upset with Chandler!'
Chandler	 Well that puts me in a difficult position.'
Monica	 Hey.'
Tim	 I got your page, is everything okay?'
Monica	 Uh well that depends, how are things with Phoebe?'
Tim	 Oh it\xc2\x92s great! It\xc2\x92s great! Thank you so much for introducing us!'
Monica	 Oh my pleasure. Okay, I\xc2\x92m afraid I\xc2\x92ve got some bad news.\n(Phoebe enters.) Phoebe!'
Phoebe	 Monica!'
Monica	 (simultaneously) You\xc2\x92re fired!'
Phoebe	 (simultaneously) I\xc2\x92m breaking up with you!'
Tim	 What?'
Phoebe	 I\xc2\x92m, I\xc2\x92m breaking up with you.'
Monica	 You\xc2\x92re fired.'
Tim	 Why?'
Phoebe	 I\xc2\x92m sorry, I\xc2\x92m just\xc2\x97I\xc2\x92m\xc2\x85I\xc2\x92m just not ready\nfor a relationship right now.'
Monica	 Yeah and-and I\xc2\x92m sorry too. But, well I just\xc2\x97I like things\ndone a certain way and the chemistry\xc2\x92s just not right.'
Phoebe	 Oh that\xc2\x92s good, the chemistry thing for us too.'
Tim	 Wow! Umm, okay. Umm\xc2\x85 (To Phoebe) I-I-I realize I came on a little\nstrong but, it\xc2\x92s only because I think you\xc2\x92re so amazing. (To Monica) And uh, I-I\njust wanna, I just wanna tell you how much I appreciate you giving me an opportunity here\nbecause I\xc2\x97you\xc2\x92re the most talented chef I\xc2\x92ve ever worked for. Anyway\xc2\x85\n(Starts to leave and Phoebe and Monica trade looks.)'
Monica	 Tim wait!'
Tim	 Yeah?'
Monica	 Umm, I think I spoke too quickly. There-there\xc2\x92s a learning curve\nwith this job and maybe we can try it again.'
Tim	 Really?'
Monica	 Yeah.'
Tim	 Thank you so much! \xc2\x91Cause I-I know I can do better!'
Monica	 Okay.'
Phoebe	 And Tim I just wanna say, good luck here. (Shakes his hand and leaves,\nwhich disgusts Monica.)'
Ross	 Hello.'
Rachel	 Hi!'
Ross	 Well, how was the date?'
Rachel	 Well I\xc2\x92m alone and I just bought fifteen dollars worth of candy\nbars, what do you think?'
Ross	 Uh-huh. What happened?'
Rachel	 I made the mistake of telling him that I was pregnant.'
Ross	 Ah, he didn\xc2\x92t uh, take it so well?'
Rachel	 Well better than you, but y\xc2\x92know still not what you want.'
Ross	 Oh?'
Rachel	 He got all weird and sputtery and then he said uh, "Yeah, I hear\nthose hemorrhoids are a bitch."'
Ross	 He sounds swell.'
Rachel	 Doesn\xc2\x92t he?'
Ross	 Hey, wanna\xc2\x85wanna a little cheering up?'
Rachel	 Yes.'
Ross	 Sit down. '
Rachel	 Okay.'
Ross	 Guess whose middle name is Muriel.'
Rachel	 (thinks then gasps) Chandler M. Bing?'
Ross	 Yeah-ha!'
Rachel	 Oh my God. (Laughs)'
Ross	 I\xc2\x92m sorry about your date.'
Rachel	 Oh it\xc2\x92s all right. I\xc2\x92m guess I\xc2\x92m just done with the whole\ndating thing. It\xc2\x92s one more thing in my life that\xc2\x92s suddenly completely\ndifferent. This is hard.'
Ross	 Yeah I know. (Pause) On the other hand in um, in about seven months\nyou\xc2\x92re gonna have something that you\xc2\x92re gonna love more than any guy you\xc2\x92ve\never gone out with. Just wait. Wait until uh, wait until the first time your baby grabs\nyour finger. You have no idea.'
Rachel	 Thanks sweetie.'
Ross	 You wanna, you wanna grab some coffee?'
Rachel	 Oh no, I think I\xc2\x92m gonna go home and eat ten candy bars.'
Ross	 Hey, I thought I cheered you up.'
Rachel	 Oh you did, there are twenty in here.'
Ross	 Right. Good night.'
Rachel	 Good night.'
Mona	 Ross?'
Ross	 Yeah?'
Mona	 Hey it\xc2\x92s Mona! From the wedding.'
Ross	 Oh hi!'
Mona	 Hi!'
Ross	 Wow! Uh\xc2\x85how are you?'
Mona	 I\xc2\x92m good except umm, you still owe me a dance.'
Ross	 Oh that\xc2\x92s right. Well uh, would you be interested in seeing a\nUkrainian film?'
Mona	 (laughs then stops) Oh you\xc2\x92re serious. Sure!'
Ross	 Great! Well umm\xc2\x85'
Mona	 I think I might need one more cup of coffee.'
Ross	 Sure! Uh, let me get it for ya.'
Mona	 Okay.'


Chandler	 (entering) Bob. Bob! Bob!!! (He turns around) What the hell are you\ndoing?!'
Bob	 I just found out this is Chandler\xc2\x92s office! Come on Toby, give me a\nhand!'
