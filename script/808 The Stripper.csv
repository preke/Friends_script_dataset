Rachel	 (coming from the bathroom) Hey Pheebs?'
Phoebe	 Huh?'
Rachel	 I\xc2\x92m having dinner with my dad tomorrow night, do you wanna come?'
Phoebe	 Sure. Yeah, he\xc2\x92s kinda sexy.'
Rachel	 Oh no, no, I\xc2\x92ll be there too.'
Phoebe	 Okay so, we\xc2\x92ll just come up with some kind of signal if it\xc2\x92s\ngoing well you can take off.'
Rachel	 No Phoebe! I just need you there for support. I haven\xc2\x92t told him\nI\xc2\x92m pregnant yet.'
Phoebe	 Oh. Why not?'
Rachel	 \xc2\x91Cause I know he\xc2\x92s gonna flip out and I hate it when he\xc2\x92s\nangry.'
Phoebe	 Oh Rachel, this is all so \xc2\x91Papa don\xc2\x92t preach.\xc2\x92'
Rachel	 What Phoebe? Wait! One time he caught me smoking he said if he ever saw\nme doing that again he\xc2\x92d make me eat the entire pack.'
Phoebe	 Wow! Oh well, I will be there! '
Rachel	 Thank you.'
Phoebe	 Gosh. I\xc2\x92m not gonna let that man make you eat your baby. (They both\nsit down by the rest of the gang and Phoebe recognizes a man by the window.) Oh. Hey! Who\nis that guy? I think I know him.'
Monica	 (recognizing him and panicking) No you don\xc2\x92t!'
Rachel	 (panicking) No you don\xc2\x92t.'
Phoebe	 Oh my God!!! Monica!! He\xc2\x92s the stripper from your bachelorette\nparty!!'
Chandler	 Her what?!!'
Phoebe	 Your secret bachelorette party\xc2\x85'
Chandler	 You had a bachelorette party?!'
Phoebe	 She untied his G-string with her teeth. (Pause) Somebody stop me!'
Chandler	 I thought we weren\xc2\x92t gonna have bachelor/bachelorette parties!\nY\xc2\x92know, we agreed that it was a silly tradition.'
Joey	 It\xc2\x92s a grand tradition!'
Monica	 I\xc2\x92m sorry, they surprised me. There was nothing I could do!'
Rachel	 Well you could\xc2\x92ve untied it with your hands.'
Joey	 This is so unfair! The one thing I wanted to do was throw my best friend a\nbachelor party, but no, I wasn\xc2\x92t allowed to. All I got was a stupid steak dinner!'
Chandler	 You went home with the waitress.'
Joey	 Oh yeah, that was a pretty good night.'
Chandler	 I can\xc2\x92t believe you didn\xc2\x92t tell me! You know that the\ntwo pillars of marriage are openness and honesty!'
Monica	 Ugh, I knew giving you that book was gonna come back and bite me\nin the ass!'

Dr. Green	 How about I order everyone the Moroccan chicken?'
Phoebe	 Oh, I-I don\xc2\x92t eat meat.'
Dr. Green	 It\xc2\x92s chicken.'
Phoebe	 Yeah, I don\xc2\x92t eat that either.'
Dr. Green	 I\xc2\x92ll never understand you lesbians. (To Rachel) So baby, tell\nme\xc2\x85what is new with you.'
Rachel	 Well actually umm\xc2\x85'
Waiter	 (interrupting) Your \xc2\x9274 Lafite sir.'
Dr. Green	 \xc2\x9274?! I ordered the \xc2\x9275! That\xc2\x92s a magnificent wine!\nThe \xc2\x9274 is sewage! Why would you bring me sewage?! (The waiter\xc2\x92s dumbfounded) Is\nthat a hard question? Are you an idiot? Is that why you\xc2\x92re a waiter?'
Waiter	 This is why I told the manager I wouldn\xc2\x92t wait on you tonight!\n(Runs off.)'
Dr. Green	 Oh come on! Don\xc2\x92t be such a baby! (Goes after him)'
Rachel	 (To Phoebe) In case you didn\xc2\x92t notice, that is a scary man.'
Phoebe	 He\xc2\x92s right though, the \xc2\x9274 is absolute piss.'
Rachel	 This was such a huge mistake. I can\xc2\x92t tell him Phoebe. I\ncan\xc2\x92t, I can\xc2\x92t, I can\xc2\x92t, I can\xc2\x92t\xc2\x85'
Phoebe	 Rachel!'
Rachel	 No it\xc2\x92s okay, this is what\xc2\x92s gonna happen. I\xc2\x92m gonna wait\na couple years and then the baby will tell him.'
Phoebe	 Why, so he can get mad at the baby?'
Rachel	 Hey, that is the\xc2\x85baby\xc2\x92s problem. (Dr. Green returns.) Oh,\neverything okay with the waiter?'
Dr. Green	 I have no idea, I went to the bathroom. So sweetie, you were starting\nto tell me what is uh, what is new with you.'
Rachel	 Well\xc2\x85 Umm, I got TiVo.'
Dr. Green	 What\xc2\x92s TiVo?'
Phoebe	 It\xc2\x92s slang for pregnant.'
Rachel	 Phoebe!'
Dr. Green	 Are you really pregnant?'
Rachel	 Well uh, yes and no. Except not no. So to sum it up, yeah.'
Dr. Green	 Who is the father? Oh no! Please don\xc2\x92t tell me it\xc2\x92s her!\n(Points at Phoebe.)'
Rachel	 No, it\xc2\x92s Ross. It\xc2\x92s Ross. You like Ross. (He just shakes his\nhead.) Oh daddy, I hope you\xc2\x92re okay with all of this. I mean think about it, this is\na good thing. You\xc2\x92re gonna\xc2\x97This is your first grandchild! You\xc2\x92re gonna be a\npoppy!'
Dr. Green	 That\xc2\x92s true. '
Rachel	 Yeah.'
Dr. Green	 (laughs) Poppy. (To Phoebe) Oh, I\xc2\x92m gonna be a poppy. (Stops\nlaughing) So when is the wedding?'
Rachel	 Who?'
Dr. Green	 The wedding! There\xc2\x92s going to be a wedding. Young lady,\ndon\xc2\x92t you sit there and tell me my first grandchild is going to be a bastard! (Rachel\npauses) Rachel Karen Green, tell me there is gonna be a wedding!!'
Rachel	 February 2nd!'
Mona	 So it was really cool seeing you lecture today.'
Ross	 Oh thanks. Although it kinda seemed like you were falling asleep there a\nlittle.'
Mona	 Oh no-no, I-I had my eyes closed so I could concentrate and y\xc2\x92know\ntake it all in.'
Ross	 Yeah, a lot of my students do that.'
Mona	 So, I gotta get going.'
Ross	 Okay, I-I\xc2\x92ll see you tonight.'
Mona	 Yeah. '
Ross	 Okay, bye. '
Mona	 Oh hey, thanks again for showing me your semi-precious stone collection.\nIt was amazing! (She leaves.)'
Chandler	 My God! You must be good in bed!'
Joey	 So uh, you and Mona, been a while now. How\xc2\x92s it going?'
Ross	 Ah, it\xc2\x92s good. It\xc2\x92s going good. I mean, we get along great.\nShe\xc2\x92s, she\xc2\x92s so\xc2\x85'
Joey	 Hot?'
Ross	 Well, I was gonna say sweet, but yeah-huh!'
Chandler	 She\xc2\x92s okay with Rachel and the baby?'
Ross	 Well I\xc2\x85I haven\xc2\x92t actually told her yet. I don\xc2\x92t want to\nscare her off, y\xc2\x92know?'
Chandler	 Well, you have to honest with her! Otherwise you may think that\nyou\xc2\x92re going down the same path, but you\xc2\x92re really going down different ones.'
Joey	 I\xc2\x92m gonna take that book and beat you to death with it.'
Monica	 (entering) Oh my God! You are gonna love me so much! I felt really bad\nabout the whole bachelorette party thing, so tonight you\xc2\x92re gonna have a bachelor\nparty.'
Chandler	 What?'
Monica	 Yeah, I got this number from this guy at work and I hired a stripper to\ncome dance for you. Am I going in the wife hall of fame or what?!'
Chandler	 Honey! That\xc2\x92s crazy! I don\xc2\x92t want you to get me a\nstripper\xc2\x85'
Joey	 Will you let the lady talk?!'
Monica	 Come on! Come on, it\xc2\x92ll be fun! It\xc2\x92ll make me feel so much\nbetter.'
Chandler	 Look, I appreciate it, but uh, it\xc2\x92s a little creepy. Y\xc2\x92know?\nI\xc2\x92m not a bachelor anymore.'
Monica	 So don\xc2\x92t think of it as a bachelor party, think of it as a\xc2\x85a\ntwo month anniversary present.'
Ross	 Sure, one year is paper, but two months is lapdance! (Joey nods his\nagreement.)'
Monica	 Please! I feel so bad! Just watch the hot woman get naked!'
Chandler	 All right fine! But I\xc2\x92m only doing this for you!'
Joey	 Yeah!'
Chandler	 And Joey.'
Monica	 Thank you. All right, now who else do you want to invite?'
Chandler	 Ah, no-no-no just Ross. Ross and Joey is embarrassing enough.'
Ross	 Uh actually, sorry I can\xc2\x92t even make it. I\xc2\x92m seeing Mona again\ntonight.'
Chandler	 I understand
Joey	 (on cell phone) I\xc2\x92m sorry I gotta cancel tonight baby\xc2\x85'
Phoebe	 I\xc2\x92m sorry I won\xc2\x92t be able to make it to your imaginary\nwedding, but I\xc2\x92m really busy that day. Yeah, I already have a unicorn baptism\nand a leprechaun bar mitzvah.'
Rachel	 I know. I know. I panicked, I panicked. I didn\xc2\x92t want him to start\nyelling at me like I was some \xc2\x9274 Latour. '
Phoebe	 It\xc2\x92s Lafite. The \xc2\x9274 Latour is actually drinking quite nicely.'
Rachel	 All right here he comes. I\xc2\x92m gonna do this, I\xc2\x92m gonna tell\nhim, I\xc2\x92m gonna be strong.'
Dr. Green	 I just called a friend of mine.'
Rachel	 Yeah?'
Dr. Green	 I think I may be able to book The Plaza on short notice.'
Rachel	 Really?! The Plaza?!! Oh daddy!! (Hugs him and Phoebe glares at\nher.) Right. Daddy, I need to talk to you. Please, sit down.'
Dr. Green	 What is it sweetie?'
Rachel	 There\xc2\x92s not gonna be a wedding. Ross and I are not getting married.'
Dr. Green	 What?!'
Rachel	 I\xc2\x92m sorry daddy.'
Dr. Green	 I don\xc2\x92t believe this!!'
Rachel	 Oh now daddy, stay calm. Please.'
Dr. Green	 Stay calm?!! How do you expect me to stay calm?! This is unacceptable\nRachel! And I wanna know why?!! Is it because that punk Ross won\xc2\x92t marry you?!\nThat\xc2\x92s it! Is that it?!'
Rachel	 Yes. Yes, he says I\xc2\x92m damaged goods.'
Joey	 So you uh, nervous about getting married?'
Chandler	 What are you doing?'
Joey	 Look, look let\xc2\x92s pretend it\xc2\x92s a real bachelor party. Okay?\nY\xc2\x92know? Before your wedding. Come on, it\xc2\x92ll be fun.'
Chandler	 Okay. I can\xc2\x92t believe tomorrow\xc2\x92s the big day.'
Joey	 How does it feel knowing you\xc2\x92re never gonna be with another woman\nagain huh? Knowing you\xc2\x92re gonna have to wake up to the same face everyday until you\nfinally have the sweet release of death.'
Chandler	 You\xc2\x92re right, this is more fun.'
Joey	 That\xc2\x92s her! Okay, come on! (They go over and open the door.)'
Stripper	 Hi!'
Chandler	 Hi. (Joey blows on a noisemaker.)'
Stripper	 So which one of you lucky boys is Chandler?'
Joey	 Uh, that-that\xc2\x92s-that\xc2\x92s me!'
Chandler	 That\xc2\x92s me.'
Joey	 Joey Tribbiani, a big fan.'
Stripper	 So is that a bedroom? (Points to the guestroom.)'
Chandler	 Yeah, yeah right over there.'
Stripper	 All right, whenever you\xc2\x92re ready. (She goes into the bedroom.)'
Chandler	 That was weird.'
Joey	 Why-why would she go in the bedroom?'
Stripper	 I\xc2\x92m waiting.'
Chandler	 So she\xc2\x92s a\xc2\x85'
Joey	 Yeah, that\xc2\x92s one naked hooker!'
Mona	 I love your place! Where is this guy from? (A statue from the top of his\napothecary table.)'
Ross	 Uh that\xc2\x92s an eighteenth century Indian artifact from Calcutta.'
Mona	 Oh wow! So, you\xc2\x92re more than just dinosaurs.'
Ross	 So much more.'
Mona	 Oh my God! Oh my God! I\xc2\x92m so sorry!'
Ross	 Aw forget it, it\xc2\x92s from Pier One. (There\xc2\x92s an angry knock\non the door.) Sorry. (Goes and opens the door to an irate Dr. Green.)'
Dr. Green	 You think you can knock up my daughter and then not marry her?!\nI\xc2\x92m gonna kill you!!'
Ross	 Y\xc2\x92know this is actually not a great time for me.'

Dr. Green	 So? Come on! Explain yourself Geller! First you get my Rachel\npregnant!'
Mona	 You got Rachel pregnant?!'
Ross	 Who did?!'
Dr. Green	 You did!'
Ross	 Yes. Yes, yes I did. (To Mona) But-but it was, it was just a one night\nthing. It meant nothing.'
Dr. Green	 Oh? Really? That\xc2\x92s what my daughter means to you? Nothing?'
Ross	 No! No sir umm, she means a lot to me. I mean, I care\xc2\x97I-I love\nRachel.'
Mona	 What?!'
Ross	 (to Mona) Oh but not that way. I mean\xc2\x85I mean I\xc2\x92m not in love\nwith her. I love her like a, like a friend.'
Dr. Green	 Oh really? That\xc2\x92s how treat a friend? You get her in trouble and\nthen refuse to marry her?'
Ross	 (to Dr. Green) Hey! I offered to marry her!'
Mona	 Wh\xc2\x85'
Ross	 (To Mona) But I didn\xc2\x92t want to.'
Dr. Green	 Well why not? So you can spend your time with this tramp?!'
Mona	 Tramp?!'
Ross	 I\xc2\x92m sorry. Dr. Green, Mona. Mona, Dr. Green.'
Chandler	 I can\xc2\x92t believe there is a naked hooker in there!'
Joey	 Wait! Wait! Maybe she\xc2\x92s a hooker and a stripper, but she got\nconfused about what she\xc2\x92s supposed to do.'
Chandler	 Could be. I mean technically she did strip, we just, we just missed\nit. (Walks towards the bedroom.) Ma\xc2\x92am, are you also a stripper?'
Hooker	 Uh, no. But I could pretend to strip, but that\xc2\x92s gonna cost extra.\nOkay, here\xc2\x92s the extras, handcuffs, spanking\xc2\x85 (Chandler grunts for her not to\ncontinue and Joey pulls him back into the kitchen.)'
Joey	 Maybe Monica\xc2\x92s playing a joke on ya. Y\xc2\x92know? Getting her own\nhusband a hooker, that\xc2\x92s pretty funny.'
Chandler	 That is funny, maybe for my birthday she\xc2\x92ll murder someone.'
Joey	 I bet Ross was in on it too. I mean he was conveniently busy.'
Hooker	 Do you mind if I smoke in here?'
Chandler	 Oh actually, I\xc2\x92d rather you\xc2\x85Yeah, go ahead. We\xc2\x92re gonna\nhave to burn that room down anyway.'
Mona	 How could you have kept all of this from me?'
Ross	 I was going to tell you, but\xc2\x85'
Dr. Green	 But what?! You figured you\xc2\x92d get what you wanted and then dump\nher like you dumped Rachel!'
Ross	 Hey! I did not dump Rachel! (To Mona) Nor are we still together. (The\nphone rings and Ross goes to answer it, only he\xc2\x92s trapped behind the apothecary table\nby Dr. Green.) Can I just\xc2\x85 (Dr. Green glares at him.) Why don\xc2\x92t we just let the\nmachine get that?'
Joey	 (on machine) Hey Ross. It\xc2\x92s Joey. There\xc2\x92s a hooker over here and\nwe thought maybe you\xc2\x92d know something about it.'
Ross	 No! No! No! No! No! I-I-I-I\xc2\x97I need to, I need to lie down.'
Stu	 So, tonight\xc2\x92s the night of the big bachelor party?'
Monica	 Yeah! Hey! Thanks for getting me that girl\xc2\x92s number.'
Stu	 No problem. So who\xc2\x92s the party for?'
Monica	 My husband.'
Stu	 You hired your husband a hooker?'
Monica	 She\xc2\x92s a stripper.'
Stu	 No, she\xc2\x92s a hooker.'
Monica	 Is that, is that what they call strippers sometimes?'
Stu	 When they\xc2\x92re hookers.'
Monica	 Oh my God Stu! I-I can\xc2\x92t believe you did this! Now are you\nabsolutely sure she\xc2\x92s a hooker?'
Stu	 Either that or she\xc2\x92s just the best, most expensive date I ever had.'
Joey	 Maybe she meant to get you a hooker.'
Chandler	 Why would she do that?'
Joey	 Maybe she wants you to learn something. Huh? Now is there anything\nyou\xc2\x92re really bad at y\xc2\x92know, sexually?'
Chandler	 This is the worst bachelor party ever!'
Hooker	 What\xc2\x92s taking you boys so long?'
Joey	 In a minute!'
Chandler	 (To Joey) In a minute? What\xc2\x92s gonna happen in a minute?!'
Joey	 All right, all right maybe-maybe you should just ask her to leave.'
Chandler	 Why me?!'
Joey	 Hey! It\xc2\x92s your bachelor party.'
Chandler	 Which is why you should do it.'
Joey	 I don\xc2\x92t want to. You do it!'
Chandler	 You do it!'
Joey	 You do it!'
Chandler	 All right Rock, Paper, Scissors who has to tell the whore to leave!\n(Joey smirks.) What?'
Joey	 I miss this.'
Chandler	 I don\xc2\x92t think we\xc2\x92ve actually done this before!'
Joey	 No, I-I miss hanging out with you.'
Chandler	 Well we\xc2\x85we still hang out.'
Joey	 Not like we used to. Remember? You and me used to be inseparable.\nY\xc2\x92know now it\xc2\x92s like\xc2\x85things are different.'
Chandler	 Well y\xc2\x92know, things are different. I\xc2\x92m\xc2\x85I\xc2\x92m married\nnow.'
Joey	 Oh sure\xc2\x97And hey, don\xc2\x92t get me wrong, I am so happy for you guys.\nI just\xc2\x85I miss\xc2\x85hanging out\xc2\x85just-just us, y\xc2\x92know?'
Chandler	 Yeah, I miss that too. I tell you what; from now on we\xc2\x92ll make\ntime to hang out with each other.'
Joey	 You got it. Come here. (They hug and are observed by the hooker.)'
Hooker	 Oh God! Listen, I am this close to robbing you guys. (Does the close\nsign.)'
Monica	 (entering quickly) She\xc2\x92s a hooker! She\xc2\x92s a hooker! She\xc2\x92s\na\xc2\x85 (Stops as she sees her.) Hi! Uh, we spoke on the phone. (Goes and shakes the\nhooker\xc2\x92s hand.)'
Ross	 So your dad dropped by. He\xc2\x92s a pleasant man!'
Rachel	 (quietly) Oh no\xc2\x85'
Phoebe	 I\xc2\x92d better go. (She goes and sits down in the La-Z-Boy E-cliner\n3000, the chair that Sit magazine called chair of the year, and they both look at\nher.) Just over here
Rachel	 Ross I\xc2\x92m so sorry. Okay. I-I will promise I will straighten this\nout with him tomorrow in person, or via e-mail.'
Ross	 I don\xc2\x92t care about your dad! I care about Mona! She was there and now\nshe\xc2\x92s totally freaked out!'
Rachel	 Oh okay, I\xc2\x92ll fix that to. What\xc2\x92s her e-mail address?'
Ross	 Rachel!'
Rachel	 All right, I promise. I\xc2\x92ll fix this. I swear.\nI\xc2\x92ll-I\xc2\x92ll-I\xc2\x92ll-I\xc2\x92ll talk to her.'
Ross	 Okay!'
Rachel	 Okay.'
Ross	 Thank you!'
Phoebe	 That\xc2\x92s it?! You call that a fight? Come on! "We were on a\nbreak!" "No we weren\xc2\x92t!" What happened to you two?!'
Ross	 Thank you so much for coming back over.'
Mona	 Oh good, you\xc2\x92re here. Yeah, and I was worried that it was going to be\nuncomfortable.'
Rachel	 I know Mona, just hear me out. First of all, I\xc2\x92m so sorry about my\nfather yelling at you, but I heard you totally held your own. You\xc2\x92re gonna have to\ntell me how you did that.'
Ross	 Focus.'
Rachel	 Okay. Um\xc2\x85But\xc2\x97Okay, yes Ross and I used to date. And yes we are\ngonna have a baby. But we are definitely not getting back together.'
Mona	 How can I be sure on that?'
Rachel	 Oh we just\xc2\x97we drove each other crazy!'
Ross	 Yeah.'
Rachel	 I mean he was possessive, he was jealous, he could never just let the\nlittle things go!'
Ross	 Trying to date this woman.'
Rachel	 Right! But, none of that compared to how kind and-and how gentle and\nthoughtful he is. (Rubbing his shoulder.)'
Ross	 Probably shouldn\xc2\x92t touch me.'
Mona	 Y\xc2\x92know, I-I-I just\xc2\x85I don\xc2\x92t want to get in the middle of\nsomething so complicated.'
Rachel	 I know, I get it, but Mona, what relationship is not complicated? I mean\nwe all have our baggage! You must too! Why else would you still be single? (Mona looks at\nher.) I am so gonna leave right now. (Ross opens the door for her and she leaves.)'
Ross	 Should I leave this open for you too?'
Mona	 I\xc2\x92m not sure yet. Why didn\xc2\x92t you just tell me about all this?'
Ross	 Because what\xc2\x92s going on with Rachel has nothing to do with how I feel\nabout you.'
Mona	 Yeah? Well you still shoulda told me.'
Ross	 I know and I was going to, but I thought it was better that you heard it\nfrom Rachel\xc2\x92s father. Look I\xc2\x85I made a mistake, but it\xc2\x92s only because I\nreally, really like you. Really!'
Mona	 Okay, I guess you can\xc2\x85close the door now. (He does so and they kiss.)'
Rachel	 (entering) Forgot my purse! (Sees them kissing.) Oh, you guys made up.\n(To Mona) He\xc2\x92s a good kisser isn\xc2\x92t he? (Ross goes to close the door on her.)\nI\xc2\x92m going! (Quickly leaves and Ross locks the door.)'
Monica	 I swear I didn\xc2\x92t know she was a hooker! I mean wh\xc2\x97Did you let\nher smoke in here?'
Chandler	 Her ass print is still on your grandmother\xc2\x92s quilt, do you really\nwant to talk about smoking?'
Monica	 Y\xc2\x92know what? I\xc2\x92m gonna make this up to you. I promised you a\nstripper (turns on the radio), and you\xc2\x92re gonna get a stripper. (She starts to\nstrip.)'
Chandler	 Monica! Wait!'
Monica	 What?'
Chandler	 (puts on his crown) Carry on.'
Monica	 Ooh, these tennis shoes are so tight. I think I\xc2\x92ll take them off.\n(Goes to do so.)'
Chandler	 Could you not narrate?'
Monica	 Gotcha sailor. (Kicks one of her shoes off and it lands in the kitchen\nknocking something down, but she continues to strip.)'

Dr. Green	 (on phone) \xc2\x85just because you\xc2\x92re not in love with the guy\nyou can\xc2\x92t\xc2\x85'
Phoebe	 (entering, quietly) Wow, you told your dad the truth.'
Rachel	 About an hour ago.'
Phoebe	 Wanna go see a movie?'
Rachel	 Yes! (She gets up and sets the phone on the counter without hanging it\nup.) Bye daddy. (Phoebe and her leave.)'
Dr. Green	 (on phone, not hearing her) \xc2\x85there\xc2\x92s gonna be a wedding!\n(Joey enters from his room and goes to get a beer from the fridge.) That\xc2\x92s\nunacceptable Rachel! What the hell does love have to do with it anyway?! There are more\nimportant things in a marriage other than love! (Joey hears something and looks around for\nthe source.) \xc2\x85constantly thinking about things! You have to think about the\nconsequences of your decision. (Joey finds that the sound is coming from the phone and\nputs it to his ear.)'
Joey	 (on phone) Hey! I do too think about the consequences of my decisions!\n(Listens) What gives you the right to\xc2\x85 (Listens) Go to hell! (Hangs up the phone and\nopens the fridge.) Stupid guy on my phone.'
