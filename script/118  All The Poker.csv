Ross	 Uh, Rach, we're running low on resumes over here."
Monica	 Do you really want a job with Popular Mechanics?'
Chandler	 Well, if you're gonna work for mechanics, those are the ones to work\nfor."
Rachel	 Hey, look, you guys, I'm going for anything here, OK? I cannot be a\nwaitress anymore, I mean it. I'm sick of the lousy tips, I'm sick of being called 'Excuse\nme...'"
Ross	 Rach, did you proofread these?'
Rachel	 Uh... yeah, why?'
Ross	 Uh, nothing, I'm sure they'll be impressed with your excellent compuper\nskills."
Rachel	 (upset) Oh my Goood! Oh, do you think it's on all of them?"
Joey	 Oh no, I'm sure the Xerox machine caught a few."

Monica	 Hey, guys.'
Chandler and Ross	 Hey.'
Rachel	 Hey... hi, ladies... uh, can I get you anything? (to Monica, quietly)
Monica	 Lots of responses.'
Rachel	 (to Monica)
Phoebe	 (reading)
Rachel	 (out loud)
Monica	 (reading)
Phoebe	 Wow!'
Rachel	 What?'
Phoebe	 (reading)
Rachel	 (grabs the bill) Give me that!'
Chandler	 You know, I can't believe you. Linda is so great! Why won't you go out\nwith her again?"
Ross	 I don't know."
Chandler	 Is this still about her whole 'The Flintstones could've really\nhappened' thing?"
Ross	 No, it's not just that. It's just\xc2\x97I want someone who... who does\nsomething for me, y'know? Who gets my heart pounding, who... who makes me, uh... (begins\nto stare lovingly at Rachel)"
Chandler	 ...little playthings with yarn?'
Ross	 What?'
Chandler	 Could you want her more?'
Ross	 Who?'
Chandler	 (sarcastically) Dee, the sarcastic sister from Whats Happening.'
Ross	 Look, I am totally, totally over her, OK, I just... (Rachel comes over,\nRoss lays head on table)
Rachel	 Hi! How are you?'
Ross	 We're fine, we're fine."
Rachel	 OK. (walks away) '
Joey	 Shut up!'
Chandler	 We're not\xc2\x97we're not saying anything."
Phoebe	 What?'
Ross	 Uhhhh... Joey cried last night.'
Joey	 Thank you.'
Chandler	 (to the girls) We were playing poker, alright...'
Joey	 There was chocolate on the three. It looked like an eight, alright?'
Ross	 Oh, guys, you should've seen him. 'Read 'em and weep.'"
Chandler	 And then he did.'
Rachel	 Well, now, how come you guys have never played poker with us?'
Phoebe	 Yeah, what is that? Like, some kind of guy thing? Like, some kind of\nsexist guy thing? Like it's poker, so only guys can play?"
Ross	 No, women are welcome to play.'
Phoebe	 Oh, OK, so then what is it? Some kind of... you know, like, like... some\nkind of, y'know, like... alright, what is it?"
Chandler	 There just don't happen to be any women in our games."
Joey	 Yeah, we just don't happen to know any women that know how to play poker."
Girls	 Oh, yeah, right.'
Monica	 Oh, please, that is such a lame excuse!'
Rachel	 Really.'
Monica	 I mean, that's a typical guy response."
Ross	 Excuse me, do any of you know how to play?'
Girls	 No.'
Rachel	 But you could teach us.'
Guys	 No.'
Chandler	 (teaching) OK, so now we draw cards.'
Monica	 So I wouldn't need any, right? Cause I have a straight."
Rachel	 Oh, good for you!'
Phoebe	 Congratulations!'
Chandler	 OK Phoebs, how many do you want?'
Phoebe	 OK, I just need two... the, um, ten of spades and the six of clubs.'
Ross	 No. No, uh, Phoebs? You can't\xc2\x97you can't do..."
Rachel	 Oh wait, I have the ten of spades! Here! (gives it to Phoebe)'
Rachel	 Oh, no-no-no-no-no-no, that's OK, I don't need them. I'm going for\nfours."
Ross	 Oh, you're... (gives up)"
Monica	 Alright, here we go. We've got salmon roulettes and assorted crudites."
Phoebe and Rachel	 OOooooo!'
Joey	 Whoa, whoa, whoa, Monica, what're you doin'? This is a poker game. You\ncan't serve food with more than one syllable. It's gotta be like chips, or dip, or\npretz...(look of realization)"
Chandler	 (changing subject) OK, so at this point, the dealer...'
Monica	 Alright, you know, we got it, we got it. Let's play for real. High\nstakes... big bucks..."
Ross	 Alright, now, you sure? Phoebe just threw away two jacks because they\ndidn't look happy..."
Phoebe	 But... I'm ready, so, just deal."
Chandler	 OK, alright, last minute lesson, last minute lesson. (holds up two\ncards) Joey... three... eight. Eight... three. (Joey is unamused) Alright babe, deal the\ncards.'
Monica	 (throws down her cards) Dammit, dammit, dammit!'
Phoebe	 (to Joey)
Joey	 About what?'
Phoebe	 About how good your cards were.'
Joey	 Heh... I was bluffing.'
Phoebe	 A-ha! And... what is bluffing? Is it not another word for... lying?'
Rachel	 OK, sorry to break up this party, but I've got resumes to fax before\nwork tomorrow... (gets up to leave)"
Guys	 Whoa, whoa, whoa!'
Chandler	 Rach, Rach, we gotta settle.'
Rachel	 Settle what?'
Chandler	 The... Jamestown colony of Virginia. You see, King George is giving us\nthe land, so...'
Ross	 The game, Rachel, the game. You owe us money for the game.'
Rachel	 Oh. Right.'
Joey	 You know what, you guys? It's their first time, why don't we just forget\nabout the money, alright?"
Monica	 Hell no, we'll pay!"
Phoebe	 OK, Monica? I had another answer all ready.'
Monica	 And you know what? We want a rematch.'
Ross	 Well that's fine with me. Could use the money."
Rachel	 (to Ross)
Ross	 (pause)...Yeah.'
Chandler	 Yes, and I get my ya-yas from Ikea. You have to put them\ntogether yourself, but they cost a little less.'
Ross	 Look, Rachel, this is poker. I play to win, alright? In order for me to\nwin, other people have to lose. So if you're gonna play poker with me, don't expect me to\nbe a 'nice guy,' OK? Cause once those cards are dealt... (claps hands three times)"
Joey	 (pause)...Yeah?'
Ross	 I'm not a nice guy."
Ross	 Alright boys, let's eat."
Chandler	 Oh, did you get that from the 'I Love Rachel' pizzeria?"
Ross	 You still on that?'
Chandler	 Oh, come on. What was with that whole Black Bart speech? (mimicking)
Ross	 You are way off, pal.'
Joey	 No, I don't think so, see Ross, because I think you love her."
Ross	 Um.... no. See, I might've had feelings for her at one time\xc2\x97not any\nmore. I just\xc2\x97I..."
Ross	 Marcel! Where are you going with that disc?'
Ross	 You are not putting that on again! Marcel, OK\xc2\x97if you press that\nbutton, you are in very, very big trouble.'
Rachel	 (opening mail) Can you believe what a jerk Ross was being?'
Monica	 Yeah, I know. He can get really competitive.'
Phoebe	 Ha. Ha, ha.'
Monica	 What?'
Phoebe	 Oh, hello, kettle? This is Monica. You're black."
Monica	 Please! I am not as bad as Ross.'
Rachel	 Oh, I beg to differ. The Pictionary incident?'
Monica	 That was not an incident! I-I was gesturing, a-and the plate\nslipped out of my hand.'
Rachel	 Oooooh. (reads letter) (surprised)
Monica	 You're kidding! Where? Where?"
Rachel	 (in disbelief)
Monica	 Oh, Rachel!'
Phoebe	 Oh, it's like the mother ship is calling you home."
Monica	 Well, what's the job?"
Rachel	 Assistant buyer. Oh! I would be shopping... for a living!'
Monica	 OK, look. That is Aunt Iris. This woman has been playing poker since she\nwas five. You gotta listen to every word she says. (opens door) Hi!'
Aunt Iris	 Is Tony Randall dead?'
Rachel	 No.'
Monica	 I don't think so."
Rachel	 Why?'
Aunt Iris	 Well, he may be now, because I think I hit him with my car.'
Monica	 What?'
Rachel	 Oh my God!'
Monica	 Really?'
Aunt Iris	 No! That's bluffing. Lesson number one. (walks into kitchen) Let me\ntell you something... everything you hear at a poker game is pure crap. (to Phoebe)
Phoebe	 Thank y... (thinks about it)'
Aunt Iris	 Girls, sit down.'
Monica	 Uh, Aunt Iris? This is Phoebe, and that's Rachel..."
Aunt Iris	 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, listen, I am parked at a meter. Let's\ndo it."
Phoebe	 Ross, could we please, please, please listen to anything else?'
Ross	 Alright.'
Ross	 I'm gonna pay for that tonight."
Rachel	 Hi!'
Ross	 Hey.'
Rachel	 Guys! Guess what, guess what, guess what, guess what!'
Chandler	 Um, ok... the... the fifth dentist caved and now they're all\nrecommending Trident?"
Rachel	 Noooo... the interview! She loved me! She absolutely loved me. We talked\nfor like two and a half hours, we have the same taste in clothes, and\xc2\x97oh, I went to\ncamp with her cousin... And, oh, the job is perfect. I can do this. I can do this well!'
All	 That's great! That's wonderful!"
Rachel	 Oh God, oh, and then she told the funniest story...'
Monica	 OK, great. You'll tell us and we'll laugh. Let's play poker."
Joey	 Alright now listen, you guys, we talked about it, and if you don't want to\nplay, we completely understand."
Chandler	 Oh yes, yes, we could play some other game... like, uh, I don't\nknow... Pictionary?"
Monica	 Ha, ha, very funny, very funny. But I think we'd like to give poker\nanother try. Shall we, ladies?"
Phoebe and Rachel	 Yes, we should. I think we should.'
Ross	 Uh, Rach, do you want me to shuffle those?'
Rachel	 No, no, thats OK. Y'know, I think I'm gonna give it a go."
Ross	 Alright.'
Rachel	 Alright... (shuffles cards expertly, all the guys stare in amazement)'

Ross	 So, Phoebs owes $7.50, Monica, you owe $10, and Rachel, you owe fifteen\nbig ones.'
Joey	 But hey, thanks for teachin' us Cross-Eyed Mary. You guys, we gotta play\nthat at our regular game."
Phoebe	 Alright, here's my $7.50. (Hands them the money) But I think you should\nknow that this money is cursed."
Joey	 What?'
Phoebe	 Oh, I cursed it. So now bad things will happen to he who spends it.'
Chandler	 That's alright, I'll take it. Bad things happen to me anyway. This way\nI can break 'em up with a movie."
Ross	 Well, that just leaves the big Green poker machine, who owes fifteen...'
Rachel	 Mmm-hmmm. Oh, so typical. Ooo, I'm a man. Ooo, I have a penis. Ooo, I\nhave to win money to exert my power over women. (hands over her money)"
Monica	 You know what? This is not over. We will play you again, and we will\nwin, and you will lose, and you will beg, and we will laugh, and we will take every last\ndime you have, and you will hate yourselves forever.'
Rachel	 Hmm. Kinda stepped on my point there, Mon.'
Ross	 So, you gals wanna hand over your money now? That way, we don't have to go\nthrough the formality of actually playing."
Rachel	 Ooooh, that's fine. We'll see who has the last laugh there, monkey boy."
Monica	 OK, we done with the chit-chat? Are we ready to play some serious poker?'
Phoebe	 (holding a card and waving it in front of her face) Hey you guys, look,\nthe one-eyed jack follows me wherever I go. (they look at her) Right, OK, serious poker.'
Monica	 Excuse me, where are you going?'
Ross	 Uh... to the bathroom.'
Monica	 Do you want to go to the bathroom, or do you wanna play poker?'
Ross	 I want to go to the bathroom. (exits)'
Joey	 Alright, well, I'm gonna order a pizza. (gets up)"
Rachel	 Oh no-no-no-no-no, I'm still waiting to hear from that job and the store\ncloses at nine, so you can eat then."
Joey	 That's fine. I'll just have a Tic-Tac to hold me over."
Monica	 Alright, Cincinnati, no blinds, everybody ante. (deals cards)'
Phoebe	 (looks at her cards) Yes! (everyone looks at her) .... or no.'
Ross	 Alright. (to Rachel)
Rachel	 Your fly is open, Geller. (he checks it, and zips up)'
Phoebe	 You guys, you know what I just realized? 'Joker' is 'poker' with a 'J.'\nCoincidence?"
Chandler	 Hey, that's... that's 'joincidence' with a 'C'!"
Joey	 Uh... Phoebe? Phoebe?'
Phoebe	 Yeah. Um... I'm out. (throws in cards)"
Rachel	 I'm in."
Monica	 Me too.'
Joey	 Me too. Alright, whattaya got.'
Ross	 Well, you better hop outta the shower, cause... I gotta flush. (lays down\ncards)'
Rachel	 Well, well, well, hop back in bucko, cause I got four sixes! (lays down\ncards) I won! I actually won! Oh my God! Y'know what? (collects chips) I think I'm gonna\nmake a little Ross pile. (holds up a chip) I think that one was Ross's, and I\nthink\xc2\x97oh\xc2\x97that one was Ross's. Yes! (Starts singing)
Rachel	 And your fly's still open..."
Rachel	 Ha, I made you look.... '
Rachel	 I couldn't be inner. Monica?"
Phoebe	 Monica, in or out?'
Monica	 (slams down cards) I hate this game! '
Phoebe	 OK Joey, your bet.'
Joey	 Ahhh, I fold like a cheap hooker who got hit in the stomach by a fat guy\nwith sores on his face. (the girls look at him, confused) Oh, I'm out."
Phoebe	 Ross?'
Ross	 Oh, I am very in.'
Phoebe	 Chandler?'
Chandler	 Couldn't be more out. (throws in cards)"
Phoebe	 Me too. Rachel.'
Rachel	 Uh, I will see you... and I'll raise you. (throws chips in pot) What do\nyou say... want to waste another buck?"
Ross	 No, not this time. (he folds) So... what'd you have?"
Rachel	 I'm not telling. (collects chips)"
Ross	 Come on, show them to me. (reaches for her cards, Rachel covers them up)'
Rachel	 No..!'
Ross	 Show them to me!'
Rachel	 Get your hands out of there! No!'
Ross	 Let me see! Show them!'
Chandler	 Y'know, I've had dates like this."
Rachel	 (deals new hand) Boy, you really can't stand to lose, can you? Your\nwhole face is getting red... little veins popping out on your temple..."
Phoebe	 Plus that shirt doesn't really match those pants."
Ross	 First of all, I'm not losing..."
Rachel	 Oh, you are losing. Definitely losing. (phone rings)'
Ross	 Let's not talk about losing. Just deal the..."
Rachel	 (answering phone) Hel-lo, Rachel Green.'
Ross	 (mimicking Rachel) Mee mee, mee-mee mee.'
Rachel	 (on phone) Excuse me. (covers up phone; to Ross) It's about the job."
Rachel	 Barbara! Hi, how are you? (Listens) Uh-huh. (Listens) No, I understand.\nYeah. Oh, oh, come on, no, I'm fine. Don't be silly. Yeah... oh, but you know, if-if\nanything else opens up, plea\xc2\x97Hello? Hello? (hangs up phone, very depressed)"
Monica	 Sorry, Rach.'
Phoebe	 Y'know, there's gonna be lots of other stuff."
Rachel	 Yeah...(sigh)....OK. Where were we? Oh, OK... five card draw, uh...\njacks or better... nothing wild, everybody ante.'
Joey	 Look, Rachel, we don't have to do this."
Rachel	 Yes, we do. (pause)'
Monica	 Alright, check.'
Joey	 Check.'
Ross	 I'm in for fifty cents. (throws it in)"
Chandler	 Call.'
Phoebe	 I'm in."
Rachel	 I see your fifty cents... and I raise you... five dollars. (throws it\nin)'
Ross	 I thought, uh... it was a fifty cent limit.'
Rachel	 Well, I just lost a job, and I'd like to raise the bet five bucks. Does\nanybody have a problem with that?"
Rachel	 (to Ross)
Ross	 No, I fold. (lays cards down, and gets up)'
Rachel	 What do you mean, you fold? Hey, come on! What is this? I thought that\n'once the cards were dealt, I'm not a nice guy.' I mean, what, were you just full of it?"
Ross	 I'm in. (throws in chips)"
Rachel	 How many you want?'
Ross	 One. (Rachel gives him the card.)'
Rachel	 Dealer takes two. (she deals herself two cards) What do you bet?'
Ross	 I bet two dollars. (throws it in)'
