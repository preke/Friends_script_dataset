Ross	 Chandler!!! Chandler!!! (He opens the door to the apartment but is stopped\nby the chain; Chandler and Monica quickly stop making out and try to get dressed.)\nChandler, I saw what you were doing through the window! Chandler, I saw what you were\ndoing to my sister! Now get out here!'
Chandler	 (To Monica) Wow! Listen, we had a good run. What was it? Four? Five\nmonths? I mean, that's more than most people have in a lifetime! So, good-bye, take care,\nbye-bye then! (He kisses her and starts to climb out the balcony window.)"
Monica	 What are you doing?!'
Chandler	 Oh, I'm going on the lamb."
Monica	 Come on Chandler, come on, I can handle Ross. (They go to the door. Ross\nis trying to stick his hand through and undo the chain; Monica pushes his hand back.) (To\nRoss) Hold on! (She opens the door.) Hey Ross. What's up bro?"
Ross	 What the hell are doing?!!'
Rachel	 (running from the guy's apartment with Joey in tow) Hey, what's-what's\ngoing on?!"
Chandler	 Well, I think, I think Ross knows about me and Monica.'
Joey	 (panicking) Dude! He's right there!"
Ross	 (To Chandler) I thought you were my best friend, this is my sister! My\nbest friend and my sister! I-I cannot believe this!'
Chandler	 Look, we're not just messing around! I love her. Okay, I'm in love\nwith her."
Monica	 I'm so sorry that you had to find out this way. I'm sorry, but it's\ntrue, I love him too."
Ross	 (happily) My best friend and my sister! I cannot believe this. (He hugs\nthem both.) (To Joey and Rachel) You guys probably wanna get some hugs in too, huh? Big\nnews!'
Rachel	 Awww, no, it's okay, we've actually known for a while."
Ross	 What? What? What?! You guys knew? (Joey and Rachel backup against the\ndoor.) You all knew and you didn't tell me?!!"
Rachel	 Well, Ross, we were worried about you. We didn't know how you were going\nto react."
Ross	 (happily again) You were worried about me? You didn't know how I was going\nto react? (He hugs them both.)"
Joey	 Okay, all right, whew! What do you say we all clear out of here and let\nthese two lovebirds get back down to business? (Ross turns and glares at him.)\nHey-hey-hey, I-I-I'm just talking here, he-he's the one doing your sister."

Ross	 Hey, you know what I just realized? If you guys ever have kids\xc2\x85'
Chandler	 (interrupting) Whoa-whoa-whoa! We're having kids?!"
Joey	 (quickly) I call Godfather!'
Ross	 You can't just call Godfather. Don't you think her brother should\nbe Godfather?"
Joey	 Sure, if you cared enough to call it first.'
Monica	 Guys, you're a few steps ahead of us."
Chandler	 Yeah, big zero gravity moon steps.'
Rachel	 Oh! Oh, I just thought of the greatest wedding gift to get you.'
Phoebe	 Ooh, I'll go in on that with you! I couldn't think of anything."
Rachel	 Okay.'
Joey	 (to her) Oh, hey Katie! Everyone, this is Katie.'
Katie	 Hi!'
All	 Hi!'
Joey	 So, are you ready to go?'
Katie	 Yeah, I just gotta run to the bathroom.'
Joey	 Oh sure, right back there. (Points.)'
Katie	 Hey, where are we going to lunch?'
Joey	 I was thinking Chinese food.'
Katie	 Ohh, I love Chinese! How did you know I love Chinese?! (She hits\nhim repeatedly as she says that.)'
Rachel	 She is so cute! You could fit her right in your little pocket!'
Joey	 I don't know. I mean I like her a lot, and she's really nice, but\xc2\x85"
Monica	 But what?'
Joey	 (shyly) She keeps punching me.'
Monica	 In that cute, little, sweet way she just did?'
Joey	 Hey, it's a lot harder than it looks! Okay? (Quietly) She-she-she's\nhurting me."
Monica	 I know what you need, you need a bodyguard. Hey Ross, what is Ben doing\nafter preschool?'
Chandler	 Hey listen, come on, Joey is having a problem! A little girl is\nbeating him up.'
Rachel	 Aww, Joey, come here. (She takes his hand.) Look honey, I know this must\nbe really, really difficult for you and I--Oh, I'm sorry. Am I hurting you?"
Ross	 (opens it to reveal Phoebe) Hey!'
Phoebe	 Hey! I brought you some house warming gifts.'
Ross	 Aww.'
Phoebe	 Yeah. Salt, so your life always has flavor.'
Ross	 Huh.'
Phoebe	 Bread, so you never go hungry.'
Ross	 Ohh.'
Phoebe	 And a scented candle for the bathroom, because well, y'know."
Ross	 Thanks. Thanks. And thanks again.'
Phoebe	 Yeah!'
Ross	 Hi!'
Ross	 Oh hi! Ross Geller. And this is my friend Phoebe.'
Steve	 Oh hi Phoebe.'
Phoebe	 Mr. President.'
Steve	 I came to talk to you about Howard.'
Ross	 Howard?'
Steve	 Yeah, he's the handy man. He's gonna be retiring next week and everyone\nwho lives here is kicking in a 100 bucks as a thank you for all the hard work type of\nthing."
Ross	 Oh that's nice."
Steve	 Yeah. So, do you want to give a check? Or\xc2\x85'
Ross	 Oh. Uhh\xc2\x85'
Steve	 Oh look, you don't have to give it too me right now! You can slip it\nunder my door. (Points to his apartment across the hall.)"
Ross	 No-no, it's not that, it's just\xc2\x85 I-I just moved in."
Steve	 Well, the guy's worked here for 25 years."
Ross	 Yes, but I've lived here for 25 minutes."
Steve	 Oh, okay, I get it. (Starts to leave.)'
Ross	 No wait, look. Look! I'm sorry, it's just I've never even met\nHoward. I-I mean I don't know Howard."
Steve	 Howard's the handy man!"
Ross	 Yes but too me he's just, man."
Steve	 Okay, fine, whatever. Welcome to the building. (Exits.)'
Ross	 (To Phoebe) Ugh, can you believe that guy!'
Phoebe	 Yeah. I really like his glasses.'
Ross	 \xc2\x85so then President Steve told everyone that I was a cheapskate, and\nnow the whole building hates me! A little kid spit on my knee! Y'know what I'm gonna do?\nI'm gonna throw a party. That's right. For everyone in the building, and I'm gonna sit\nthem down and explain to them, I am not a bad guy. I am not a cheap guy! I'm just a guy\nwho-who stands up for what he believes in. A man with principles."
Chandler	 (To Rachel) Sounds like a fun party.'
Rachel	 Hmm. Look, Ross, if you want your neighbors to like you, why don't you\njust pay the hundred bucks? The party's gonna cost you way more than that."
Ross	 It doesn't matter! It's my principles! We're talking about my principles!"
Rachel	 Okay, I thought it was about your neighbors liking you.'
Ross	 Oh, they'll like me. Once they come to my awesome PAR-TAY! Okay, I gotta\nrun. I gotta go get some nametags. (Exits.)"
Rachel	 And that crazy party animal will be your brother-in-law.'
Chandler	 Very, very funny, but don't say things like that in front of Monica. I\ndon't want you putting any ideas in her head."
Rachel	 Umm, Chandler, you do realize that those ideas are probably\nalready in Monica's head."
Chandler	 Wh-wh-why?!'
Rachel	 Well, because she loves you and because you love her.'
Chandler	 Yeah, so, what's that supposed to mean?!"
Rachel	 Hey, Chandler, don't freak out! I'm telling you something you already\nknow! Come on, she broke up with Richard because he didn't want to have babies. And she's\na woman, and she's almost 30, and y'know it's Monica."
Chandler	 I don't see it that way. Okay? Because, I see two Monicas, the one\nthat was my friend, who lived across the hall, and wanted to have a lot of babies and then\nthe new Monica, who I just started to date. Now, who's to say what she wants?!\nI\xc2\x92m right. I'm right. Am I right?"
Rachel	 No, you're right, you are absolutely right. I mean that makes, that\nmakes everything different."
Chandler	 Okay. It's not different at all, is it?"
Rachel	 Not unless different means the same.'
Katie	 You were so funny with that waiter! You're such a nut! (She slaps her\nthighs, Joey jerks, and spills some of his coffee.)"
Joey	 (sets the coffee down) Y'know, breadstick fangs are always funny."
Katie	 No, you make them funny. You're the funny one! (She punches him again and\nhe retreats to the arm of the couch.)"
Joey	 Uhh, look Katie, uh listen, we-we need to talk. Okay? Umm, look I like\nyou. I-I really do, I like you a lot. Okay? But sometimes when you, when you playfully\npunch me like that it-it feels like someone's hitting me with a very tiny but very real\nbat."
Katie	 Aww, like I could hurt you. Are you making fun of my size? Don't make fun\nof me because of my size! (She punches him again and almost knocks him off the arm of the\ncouch.)"
Monica	 Isn't this great?"
Chandler	 Hmm.'
Monica	 Couldn't you just stay like this forever? (His eyes snap open.)\nChandler! Couldn't you just stay here forever?"
Chandler	 Yeah, here, somewhere else, y'know where-where ever. (Gets up.)"
Monica	 Are you okay?'
Chandler	 Yeah, I'm cool. Casual."
Monica	 What-what are you doing?'
Chandler	 I'm just hanging out. Y'know, having fun. Y'know with the girl that\nI'm seeing casually."
Monica	 Man, I knew it! I knew you were going to do this!!'
Chandler	 What?!'
Monica	 Get all freaked out because everybody was talking and just joking around\nabout marriage and stuff.'
Chandler	 Well, you do want all that stuff, right?'
Monica	 Oh and you know what I want!'
Chandler	 Yes! You want babies! You have baby fever!'
Monica	 I do not have baby fever!'
Chandler	 Oh please, you are obsessed with babies and-and marriage and\neverything that's related to babies and-and marriage! I've got an idea, why don't we turn\ndown the heat on this pressure cooker?!"
Monica	 Have you lost your mind? Chandler, this isn't about me! This is about\nyou and all your weird relationship commitment crap!"
Chandler	 Nah-uh! I know you! Okay? I know the thoughts that you have in the\nhead--in your head!'
Monica	 You don't know everything. Did you know that I'm going out with Rachel\ntonight instead of you? Hmm? And did you know that the only baby around here is you?! And\ndid you know that I can't even look at you right now?! (She storms out.)"
Chandler	 Well, I did not know that.'

Chandler	 It's gonna be okay, right? I mean she's not gonna leave me? This is,\nthis is fixable."
Ross and Joey	 Oh yeah, yeah, sure. Absolutely.'
Chandler	 By me?'
Ross	 Oh, no!'
Joey	 No-no.'
Ross	 Well, unless you make some kind of big gesture.'
Joey	 Yeah, big!'
Joey	 Uh-oh, shht! The Misses.'
Monica	 Gunther, can I get a coffee (Looks at Chandler) to go?'
Chandler	 Monica. (Goes to talk to her.)'
Monica	 I'm still not done not wanting to talk to you."
Chandler	 Just tell me what I need to do to make things right.'
Monica	 What?!'
Chandler	 Well, that's what we do. Y'know, I-I mess up and then you tell me how\nto fix it and then I do and then y'know you think I'm all cute again."
Monica	 Really? I'm really tired of being your relationship tutor. You're gonna\nhave to figure this one for yourself. All right? Y'know what? If you're too afraid to be\nin a real relationship, then don't be in one. (She walks out.)"
Ross	 Phoebe! (He grabs her arm to get her attention.)'
Phoebe	 Oh, hi Ross!'
Ross	 What are you doing?'
Phoebe	 Oh, I thought this was your party and it turns out it\xc2\x92s a party for\nHoward. He's just the sweetest little man! (A guest walks up to her.)"
Guest #1	 See ya Phoebe! Oh and hey, thanks for chipping in!'
Ross	 You chipped in?!'
Phoebe	 Yeah, uh-huh, a 100 dollars.'
Ross	 Phoebe! I can't believe you gave them money! I thought you agreed it was\ntotally unreasonable that they asked me for that money!"
Phoebe	 Yeah, but they didn't ask me! Y'know? This way I'm just y'know, the\nexotic, generous stranger. That's always fun to be."
Ross	 Yeah, but you're making me look bad!"
Phoebe	 No I'm not. No! If anything I'm making you look better! They'll see you\ntalking to me and that's--I'm a hit!"
Steve	 (walking up) Oh hey, Pheebs!'
Phoebe	 Hey!'
Steve	 Oh hey, Ross. Umm, see, I was thinking maybe you two could switch\napartments because Phoebe's more our kind of people. Something to think about. (Walks\naway.)"
Phoebe	 Yeah, okay, my bad.'
Joey	 Hey!'
Rachel	 Hi! Wow! You look, you look\xc2\x85big.'
Joey	 Thanks! I've been working out. Hey listen, is it obvious that I'm wearing\nsix sweaters?"
Rachel	 Uhhh, yeah. But it's not obvious why."
Joey	 Well look, I\xc2\x92m breaking up with Katie so I had to put on some extra\npadding. Y'know? I mean, if she hits me when she's happy, can you imagine how hard she's\ngonna hit me when I tell her I'm taking away the Joey love?"
Katie	 (entering) Hi!'
Joey	 Hey! Hiya!'
Rachel	 Hey! Hey, cute jacket!'
Katie	 Oh, thanks! That's so sweet! (She punches Rachel like she punched Joey.)"
Rachel	 Oh! Ow! (Joey motions, "You see what I mean?!")'
Katie	 Oh, ow! Did Joey tell you to say that? You guys, (Punches Joey) are too\nmuch! (Punches Rachel.)'
Rachel	 Whoa! (Laughs) Y'know what Katie? I gotta tell ya I-I-I-I think you are\nthe one who is too much. (She punches Katie back.)"
Katie	 Ohh, Joey has the nicest friends! (She punches Rachel.)'
Rachel	 Ohh, and the nicest girlfriend! (She retaliates.)'
Katie	 You're so sweet! (Punches Rachel yet again.)"
Rachel	 Ohh, you're so sweet! (She kicks Katie in the shin.)"
Katie	 Oww!!!! Joey, she just kicked me.'
Joey	 Huh.'
Katie	 Well? Aren't you gonna do something?"
Joey	 Uhh\xc2\x85.'
Katie	 You'd better do something, or I'm gonna walk out that door right now!\nWell? Are you gonna?"
Joey	 Nah.'
Ross	 (trying to get her attention) Phoebe?'
Phoebe	 (ignoring him and continuing her conversation) That's what I'm saying.\n(Laughs.)"
Ross	 (tapping her on the shoulder) Phoebe? Phoebe?'
Phoebe	 Ooh. (Turns to him.)'
Ross	 Look, this is a disaster! Can't I please just go?"
Phoebe	 No! No! I'm talking you up to people. Just give it a little time, all\nright? Relax, get something to eat! Okay?"
Ross	 So uh, what did you tell them about me?'
Phoebe	 Oh, I was telling them about you and Emily. Y'know, try to get some\nsympathy."
Ross	 Ohh. (He cuts himself a piece of cake.)'
Phoebe	 But somehow you came off as the bad guy.'
Ross	 What?!'
Phoebe	 Yeah, I think I told it wrong. Y'know, we should talk about that because\nI don't totally understand what happened there."
Ross	 (trying a piece of cake) Ohh, this cake is really good!'
Phoebe	 Oh, okay, see? Things are looking up already!'
Guest #2	 (sees the cake) Oh my God! Someone cut Howard's cake! (Ross tries\ndumping it into a nearby plant.) Who would do a think like that?"
Steve	 3-B!'
All	 Oh yeah, aww!'
Steve	 Okay, you got your free food! You ruined everyone's fun! Don't you think\nit's time you went home?!"
Guest #3	 Yeah, leave!'
All	 Yeah, get out! Now!'
Steve	 Go back to 3-B, 3-B!'
Phoebe	 All right, everyone calm down! Everyone calm down! I have something that\nI would like to say! Who here likes Ross? (Ross is the only one who raises his hand and\nPhoebe glares at him to put his hand back down.) Of course you don\'t like him! He-he\ndidn\'t give you any money, he raised his own hand when I asked, "Who hear likes\nRoss," and he\'s wearing two nametags! (He takes one off.) I-I\'ll be honest with you\nguys, when I first met Ross I didn\'t like him at all! But then once I got to know him I\nsaw that he\'s really sweet and caring and very generous. I mean, all I\'m saying is\ndon\'t judge Ross before you get to know him all right? I mean, I like all you guys now,\nbut when I first meet you y\'know Kurt, I thought, y\'know abrasive drunk, umm Lola, mind\nnumbingly stupid! And okay, you guys (She turns to an elderly gentleman and a 20 something\nwoman, who\'re a couple.) (To the girl) Gold-digger, (To the old guy) cradle robbing perv!\nSo, I think you all know what I mean.'
Phoebe	 Obviously I didn't think they were gonna start throwing things. I just\nthought if I kept insulting everyone, you would jump in and defend everyone and then you\ncould look like the hero."
Ross	 Oh wow, yeah! See, I did not get that.'
Chandler	 Where's Monica?! Where is she? I need to talk to her! It's urgent! Is\nshe here?"
Monica	 (raising her hand) I'm Monica."
Chandler	 I need to talk to you, it's urgent!"
Monica	 Okay.'
Chandler	 Okay, I've been doing a lot of thinking about us, y'know a lot of uhh,\nus thinking. And uh, well I guess there's only one-one way to do this. (He slowly and\nawkwardly gets down on one knee.)"
Monica	 Wait what-wh-wh-what are you doing?!'
Chandler	 (getting out a ring box) Monica\xc2\x85'
Monica	 No-no, don't-don't-don't do it!"
Chandler	 Will you marry me?'
Ross	 Oh-no. No. No.'
Joey	 What a bad idea!'
Rachel	 Ohhhh, I cannot look at it! (She doesn't move.)"
Monica	 Chandler, why are you doing this?'
Chandler	 I don't know. But I know I'm not afraid to do this."
Monica	 Chandler.'
Chandler	 I'm doing this because I'm sorry?"
Monica	 Do you umm, you really think the best reason to get married is because\nyou're sorry?"
Chandler	 No, the best reason to get married is pregnancy. Sorry is pretty much\nfourth y'know, behind being ready and actually wanting to get married. (Laughs.)\nWill you be my wife?"
Monica	 (kneels with him) Chandler, umm, I want you to take just a minute and I\nwant you to think about how ridiculous this sounds.'
Chandler	 Yeah, I'm kinda wishing everyone wasn't here right now."
Monica	 Honey! Do you know that none of that stuff came from me?! I mean I never\nsaid I wanted to have babies and get married right now!'
Chandler	 Yeah I know, but I was really confused and then I talked to these\nguys. (Turns to look at Ross and Joey.)'
Monica	 Who? Two divorces and Joey?!'
Ross	 Hey!'
Joey	 She's right y'know."
Ross	 Yeah, but still, cheap shot!'
Monica	 Y'know what? Y'know when I said that I want you to deal with this\nrelationship stuff all on your own? Well, you're not ready for that."
Chandler	 I didn't think I was!"
Monica	 Oh my God, what would have done if I said yes?'
Chandler	 Well I would've been happy because I would've be able to spend the\nrest of my life with the woman that I love. Or, you would've seen a Chandler shaped hole\nin that door. (Points at the door.)"

Joey	 Hey Ross, will you pass me that knife?'
Ross	 No, I will not!'
Joey	 Oh, it's okay. You don't have to be so mean about it."
Ross	 You're right, I'm sorry. Will you marry me?"
Phoebe	 Aw, and I was gonna ask you to marry me because I forgot to say hello to\nyou last week.'
Rachel	 Oh no wait Pheebs, I think for something like that you just ask them to\nmove in with you. But I'm not sure, Chandler?"
Chandler	 Okay, how long is this going to go on.'
Monica	 Well I think the length of teasing is directly related to how insane you\nwere so, a long time.'
Ross	 This is fun. Hey Rach, remember that whole "We were on a break\nthing?" Well, I\'m sorry, will you marry me? (Laughs--whines as he sees that no one is\nlaughing. They\'re just staring at him in shock.)'
Chandler	 That's not funny."
Joey	 That's not funny at all!"
