Joey	 Monica, hey, can I borrow the Porsche?'
Monica	 Ok.'
Joey	 Alright!'
Monica	 But ehm...what is it not?'
Joey	 (abashed) A place to entertain my lady friends.'
Monica	 And what else is it not?'
Joey	 (even more abashed) A place to eat spaghetti.'
Monica	 Very good! (Gives him the keys) What do you need it\nfor anyway?'
Joey	 Oh well, the powerball lottery is upto 300 million and\nthey don't sell tickets here in New York, so..."
Rachel	 Oh! So you're driving up to Connecticut?"
Joey	 (hesitates for a moment)Yeah Connecticut...Not West\nVirginia.'
Monica	 Hey, maybe I'll drive you up there! I'd like to buy\nsome tickets myself! "
Joey	 Uh!'
Monica	 Yeah with Chandler not getting paid, we could really\nuse 300 million dollars.'
Chandler	 Yeah, because if I was at my old job we'd say 300\nmillion? No thank you!"
Phoebe	 Hey will you get me tickets too?'
Rachel	 Yeah me too. oh! I have an idea. Why don't we all\npitch in 50 bucks, we'll pool our money together and then if we win,\nwe'll split it!"
Everyone almost simultaneously except Ross	 yeah thats a great\nidea!'
Ross	 No thanks!'
Phoebe	 You don't wanna win the lottery?"
Ross	 (in a  mocking voice)Uh...sure I do, and I also wanna\nbe King of my own country and find out what happened to Amelia Earhart.'
Chandler	 Still on Amelia Earhart?'
Ross	 The woman just vanished!'
Joey	 Seriously, Ross, you don't want in on this?"
Ross	 No! Do you know what your odds are of winning the\nlottery? I...I mean you have a better chance of being struck by\nlightning 42 times.'
Chandler	 Yes but there's six of us so we'd only have to get\nstruck by lightning 7 times."
Joey	 I like those odds!'
Ross	 Seriously you guys, I can't believe you're going to\nspend 250 dollars on the lottery, I mean that's such a bunch of boohaki."
Chandler	 (looking around at the others)I'll ask. (To Ross)\nBoohaki?"
Ross	 Oh oh, we think Emma is about to start talking so we're\ntrying to be careful about what words we use in front of her."
Rachel	 Yeah so get ready to hear alot of ehm...boohaki,\ngoshdarnit and brotherpucker.'
Monica	 How do you know she's gonna start talking?"
Rachel	 Well when I talk to her I almost feel like she\nunderstands what I'm saying."
Chandler	 Kinda like Joey.'
Joey	 (who wasn't paying attention)What's that now?"

Monica	 God! Look at all these tickets! It's so exciting! You\nknow I haven't won anything since the sixth grade."
Chandler	 Pie eating contest?'
Monica	 Oh! You assume because I was heavy that's the only way\nI could win something? "
Chandler	 No, I saw a picture of you covered in blueberries.'
Monica	 (smiling)That was a good day!'
Ross	 (yelling to Monica)They're towing your car, they're\ntowing your car!!"
Monica	 I'm parked in a garage on Morton! "
Ross	 (panting)They're towing a car. And I am seeing...spots."
Joey	 (sounding panicky)Oh my god Ross! You don't have Emma!\nAnd Rachel you don't have Emma! (Starts yelling) Where's Emma? Who has\nEmma!?"
Rachel	 Joey relax! My mother picked her up two hours ago. You\nwere there!'
Joey	 (not yelling anymore)I was?'
Racel	 Yes and you talked to her...'
Joey	 I did?'
Rachel	 She dropped off a casserole?'
Joey	 Oh yeah! The casserole lady.'
Monica	 (to Ross)So, did you come by to watch us win the big\nbucks?'
Ross	 Yeah, uh... and then I figured after you win, we could\nall go out to the balcony and see a night rainbow with gremlins dancing\non top of it!'
Chandler	 (hysterical)Don't touch the phone! I'll get it, I'll\nget it, I'll get it!! (picks up the phone)"
Ross	 (to Monica)Think he washed his hands?'
Chandler	 (into receiver)Hello? Hey Charlie, what do you know?'
Rachel	 (to Monica)What's going on?"
Monica	 Chandler is supposed to find out if he's getting an\nassistent job at his ad agency. But out of the 15 interns, they are\nonly hiring three."
Joey	 Ooh! Tough odds!'
Ross	 (mockingly)Yeah if only it were a sure thing like your\n24 state lottery!'
Joey	 (smiling)Look who's coming around!"
Chandler	 (still on the phone)Damnit. Alright call me when\nyou know more.'
Joey	 (excited)Did you get it?'
Chandler	 One of the slots got filled.'
Joey	 (Still excited)By you!?'
Chandler	 Sense the tone! No that kid Nate got it.'
Monica	 Oh! I hate that guy! I mean come on kid! Pull up your\npants!'
Chandler	 Yeah I know.'
Rachel	 Well, there's two spots left right?"
Chandler	 Yeah...I mean I want this so much! I mean, I wanna\nget one, I want my friend Charlie to get one...Except I don't care\nabout Charlie."
Phoebe	 (excited)Hey you guys! Ok, you're not going to\nbelieve this! I just saw my psychic and she said I was definitely gonna\nwin the lottery tonight!"
Monica	 Hey that reminds me, I thought we could use some extra\nluck so I brought a wishbone home from work.'
Ross	 (mockingly)A psychic AND a wishbone? Guys! Give someone\nelse a chance!'
Monica	 Alright, who wants to do it?'
Phoebe	 Oh can I? Vegetarians never get to do the wishbone.\nIt's really not fair either! You know, just because we don't eat the\nmeat doesn't mean we don't like to play with the carcasses!"
Monica	 Ok, hey Rach?'
Rachel	 Oh no, I'm good, I don't wanna get that turkey smell\nall over my hands."
Joey	 I'll do it!! It'll get the casserole stink off of mine."
Phoebe	 I hope I win!'
Monica	 Well, it doesn't really matter ... you're both wishing\nfor the same thing, right?"
Joey	 I can't tell you what I'm wishing for! Else...you\nknow...won't come true!"
Monica	 Right! .. but we "know" what you\'re wishing for!'
Joey	 Can't really say!"
Monica	 I understand, but you're wishing for what we think\nyou're wishing for, aren't you?"
Joey	 (slightly irritated)I'm not really comfortable with\nthese questions!"
Rachel, Chandler and Monica	 Please, just do it!'
Phoebe	 One, two, three!'
Joey	 I won, hey!'
Ross	 You know what, I'm sure your wish is gonna come true,\nbut, you guys - just in case, maybe a genie will come out if we rub\nthis lamp! (rubs lamp, stops because it's very hot) Ah!! That thing\ngets hot!!"
Rachel	 You know, Ross, just keep making your jokes. How are\nyou gonna feel if we actually do win?'
Ross	 Uh, you're not gonna win."
Rachel	 Oh, I know, I know, the odds are against us, but\nsomebody has to win, and it could be us! And then how you gonna feel?\nYou know, we\'re gonna be all like "oh everybody, let\'s take our\nhelicopters up to the cape" and you\'re gonna be all like "oh, I can\'t\nguys, I\'ll meet you guys up there, I gotta gas up the Hyundai"'
Ross	 Ok, I've heard myself on tape and I sound nothing like\nthat."
Chandler	 I can see the headline now
Ross	 Why would I eat my own arm?'
Chandler	 Well you wouldn't, but we own the paper, we can\nprint whatever we want."
Monica	 You know what, Ross? I'm gonna throw in 50 bucks for\nyou."
Ross	 Why?'
Monica	 Because I know that you think the lottery is "boohaki"\nbut we\'re all here and gonna watch the numbers and have fun. And you\'re\nmy brother, and I want you to be a part of this.'
Ross	 You don't have to do that, I'll pay for myself. But just\nthe fact that you want me to have fun with you guys - that's so sweet!\nCome here (they kiss and hug)"
Phoebe	 Get a room!'
Chandler	 Ok, so now that you're in, what are you gonna do if\nwe win?"
Ross	 I don't know, probably just invest it."
Chandler	 Ooh! Calm down ...'
Joey	 Seriously, that's your fantasy? To invest it? "
Ross	 Oh, I\'m sorry, did I say "invest it"? I meant "be cool\nand piss it all away" (Joey and Chandler pleased)'
Joey	 Ooh, ooh, I know! We should pool all own money and buy\nthe Knicks!'
Rachel	 I don't really care about the Knicks."
Joey	 Oh, you will when I pick you as starting forward.'
Rachel	 (touched) You would do that? I never get picked!'
Chandler	 You know, I'm not sure a sports team is the way to\ngo."
Joey	 You're not gonna let me buy the Knicks?? I can't believe\nyou're taking this away from me!"
Chandler	 You're right, it has been you dream for over 15\nseconds."
Ross	 (to Rachel) Uh, how long until they announce the\nnumbers, Mommy?'
Chandler	 (looks around) I'll take this one too (to Ross) Uh\n... Mommy?"
Ross	 Oh, I\'ve gotten into the habit of calling Rachel "Mommy"\nwhen we\'re around Emma. Which I now realize we are not ...'
Rachel	 I'm hoping that if she hears it enough it will be her\nfirst word."
Ross	 Although if we\'re gonna do that, we should probably call\nme "Daddy" too.'
Phoebe	 Oooh, I like that, "daddy" (in a sexy tone)'
Ross	 I ... I was just talking about Rachel.'
Phoebe	 (still in sexy tone) Oooh, is daddy getting angry? Is\ndaddy gonna spank me?'
Ross	 (tries to be sexy too) Well that depends ... have you\nbeen a baaad gi .. (stops) no I can't."
Chandler	 Hello? Hello? Oh, hey Charlie. Did anybody else\nhear? ... What? Susan got it?? How? Oh man, I would have slept with\nhim!! .. Alright, bye. (hangs up)'
Joey	 Dude, I'm sorry. But hey, there's one spot left, right?"
Chandler	 Well no, Charlie's gonna get that."
Monica	 Hey, don't say that! You got just as good a chance as\nanybody else of getting that job!"
Chandler	 He's the boss's son."
Monica	 Come on, lottery!! (everybody cheers)'
Rachel	 Ooh, you guys, it starts in like 20 minutes.'
Monica	 Ok, here we go. We need to sort out the tickets as\nquickly as possible to see if we've won. So does anybody have any ideas\nhow to organize this? (doesn't let them answer) Ok, how about this
Rachel	 Ooh, I have another idea!'
Monica	 I'm sorry, idea time is over."
Phoebe	 Ok, well, are all the tickets in the bowl?'
Monica	 Yeah.'
Chandler	 What about the ones you have on the nightstand?'
Monica	 There are no tickets on the nightstand!'
Chandler	 Yes there are, I just saw them a few minutes ago.'
Monica	 Un, no you didn't! You must be mistaken!"
Chandler	 Honey, there are like 20 tickets on the nightstand!'
Monica	 Chandler, sense the tone!!'
Rachel	 Well, well, well, look what mommy found!!'
Monica	 Ok, fine!! I bought 20 extra tickets for me and\nChandler.'
Phoebe	 Uh! The psychic also said that I would be betrayed.'
Ross	 I can't believe this, I thought we were all in this\ntogether!"
Monica	 Hey, you just got in 5 minutes ago!'
Ross	 3 minutes ago!!! I don't know why that's important ..."
Joey	 I was with you the whole time we were in Connecticut,\nwhen did you even get those?'
Monica	 When you were reading the dirty magazines without\ntaking off the plastic!'
Joey	 (to Ross) I'll show you how."
Rachel	 Ok, well Monica, suppose one of your "special" tickets\nwin? How are you gonna feel when you win the lottery and you lose all\nyour friends?'
Monica	 Please ... if I win the lottery, you guys are not\ngonna leave me. Someone gave me a basket of mini-muffins last week and\nI couldn't get rid of you for 3 days!"
Rachel	 Chandler, would you just tell her what she did was\nwrong?'
Chandler	 (to Mon) She's right, you shouldn't have bought\ntickets just for us ..."
Monica	 Ahhh!  (shocked)'
Chandler	 Let me finish ... (to everyone else) however, it\ndoesn't look like I'm gonna get this job so I can't afford to have\nprinciples, so screw you, the tickets are ours!! (takes tickets from\nRachel)"
Monica	 There's the man I married!!"
Rachel	 All right, believe me.If you win the lottery, it's\nthe last you're gonna hear from us!"
Monica	 Fine! Don't be my friends! I'll buy new friends!\nYeah, and then I'll pay for their plastic surgery so they'd look just\nlike you!"
Rachel	 (surprised) OH! Alright, you know what? That's it! I\nwant my share of the tickets (picks up the bowl)!"
Joey	 Yeah, I want my tickets too (takes the bowl from\nRachel)! And I'm buying the Knicks! And Steffi Graff, ah ah!"
Ross	 Than I want mine, too (takes the bowl from Joey)! And\nif I win I'm gonna put it all into a very low-yield bond."
Phoebe	 Oh, you guys! We've got to keep all the tickets\ntogether (takes the bowl from Ross and puts it on the table)"
Monica	 No, no! We should divide them up (picks up the bowl)\nand I should get extra because we used my card to buy them!'
Joey	 Hey, if anybody gets extra tickets, it should be me!\nThis all thing was my idea! (takes the bowl from Monica)'
Chandler	 Oh, yeah! Thanks for inventing the lottery!'
Rachel	 Ok, that's it! Just give'em to me! I'll split them\nup! (she tries to snatch the bowl from Joey's hands but she can't, so\nshe pinches his nipple and she manages to take it)"
Joey	 (in pain) Oh!'
Phoebe	 (she takes the bowl from Rachel's hands and she\nstarts running around the room and yelling) OOOOOHHHHH!"
Ross	 (trying to stop her) Hey, hey!!'
Phoebe	 (keeping on running and yelling) OOOOOHHHHH! (she\nstops) Fine, I can't take it anymore! I'm putting an end to this! (she\ngoes out to the balcony)"
Rachel	 Oh, if she jumps, I get her tickets.'
Joey	 No, no! (they all go towards the balcony but they get\njammed in the window)'
Phoebe	 If we are not doing it together, we're not doing it\nat all! So, say goodbye to your tickets! (She holds out the bowl, and\nmakes as to drop the tickets on the street)."
Everyone	 NO!!'
Phoebe	 Don't come any closer!"
Chandler	 Can I come a little bit closer, valuable things are\ngetting squished...'
Phoebe	 No, what's more important, your friends or money?"
Everyone but Monica	 Friends! '
Monica	 Money! (they all look at her) Friends...'
Phoebe	 Hey Monica, what about your extra tickets?'
Monica	 They're all in there! Even these five that I hid in\nmy bra (takes some tickets out of her bra and gives them to Phoebe)..."
Ross	 Monica!'
Phoebe	 Ok, good! (pause) You guys were so scared! There was\nno way I was gonna dump this...(a pigeon swoops down, scaring Phoebe\nwho drops the bowl on the street) Oh God, no! (pause) I think I broke\nyour bowl.'
Ross	 Go, go, go!!'
Phoebe	 What a beautiful night to be running around the\nstreet, looking for tickets. And the wind sure made it fun.'
Monica	 Phoebe, we lost half of them.'
Phoebe	 So, what? Monica, we have the winning ticket! My\npsychic said I  was gonna win, remember?'
Ross	 Weird.. your psychic didn't mention anything about the\nscary pigeon..."
Phoebe	 As a matter of fact she said that's how I am going to\ndie. (pause ) So, excuse me for being a little skittish."
Chandler	 (looking at the answering machine) Hey, there's two\nmessages. These could be from work!"
Monica	 Oh, play them!'
Chandler	 Ok, here we go! (he pushes the play button)'
Message	 (Phoebe\'s voice) "Hello. Th-this is the pigeon from\nthe balcony calling to apologise" (they all turns to look at Phoebe) "I\nsh.. I shouldn\'t have knocked the tickets out of the pretty lady\'s\nhand. It-it was all my fault. Not hers. Bye. Coo."'
Phoebe	 Well, I bet that was very hard for him to do.'
Second message	 "Hey Chandler, it\'s Charlie"'
Chandler	 This is..shhh!'
Second Message	 "Listen, oh... it turns I got the last spot.\nI\'m really sorry man, it was a lot of fun working with you. Give me a\ncall if you want."'
Monica	 Oh God, I am so sorry honey...'
All	 Oh, so sorry man! Sorry!'
Rachel	 Oh, it is so unfair. It's like that time they\npromoted Sandra over me at work."
Chandler	 Oh, is she related to Ralph Lauren?'
Rachel	 No, she was just much better at job than me!'
Phoebe	 Guys, the drawing is about to start!'
Rachel	 (To Ross) You know what? We should call my mum's\nhouse and say goodnight to Emma before she goes down."
Ross	 Oh yeah, it's a good idea!"
Monica	 (she hugs Chandler) Honey, you've been really strong\nabout this, I know how badly you wanted that job."
Chandler	 Yeah, you know, I really thought I deserved it.\n(pause) But... let's go win the lottery... I mean, we still have 130\nchances to win, right?"
Monica	 (she draws out a ticket from a pocket of her pants)\n131! (they kiss)'
Ross	 (on the phone) Goodnight sweetheart! I love you. And\nremember, you're daddy's little girl... (covering the phone, to Rachel)\nPhoebe's totally ruined that for me... (he passes the receiver to\nRachel)"
Rachel	 Hi mum, put her back on!'
Joey	 (sitting on the sofa in front of the tv) Rach, come on!\nThey are announcing the numbers! My God, I can already feel myself\nchanging.'
TV	 "Here we are, the official Powerball numbers! We have 53"'
Chandler	 I got that!'
Ross	 Oh, we have one too!!'
Monica	 We are on a roll, people!!'
Ross	 (calling Rachel) Come on!!'
Rachel	 (on the phone) Mum, please!I know you love your new\nlips, but I can barely understand you! Would you, please, just let me\nsay goodnight to my daughter?'
TV	 "And number 29! Here we go! The Powerball is 7"'
Monica	 Check your numbers! Make me rich!'
Rachel	 (she goes towards the others and she's very excited)\nGuys, you're not gonna believe this! I was just saying goodnight to\nEmma and she said her first words!!"
All	 Wow!'
Joey	 And what did she say?'
Rachel	 She said "gleba"!! (she celebrates)'
Monica	 Make me rich!!'
Rachel	 (to Ross) Isn't that amazing?"
Ross	 Oh yeah, no no no...that's great!"
Rachel	 Why-why aren't you more excited?"
Ross	 Oh, Rach...oh..."gleba" is not a word.'
Rachel	 Oh, but of course it is!'
Ross	 Okay, what does it mean?'
Rachel	 I don't know all the words."
Ross	 I'm just, I'm just glad I didn't miss my daughter's\nfirst words (goes back to checking the tickets)."
Ross	 Yes you did, gleba is a word!'
Ross	 Ok, use it in a sentence.'
Rachel	 Ok... "Emma just said gleba"!'
Ross	 It's not a word!"
Rachel	 Okay, okay, okay, fine, I'm gonna look it up (she goes\nand picks up the dictionary)."
Ross	 Oh, oh, ok, great. You know what, while you're at it she\nsaid another word the other day, why don't you, why don't you look up
Rachel	 (searching the dictionary) Alright, okay, okay, gleba,\ngleba... (excited) Gleba! Ha! Here it is
Ross	 She's gonna be a scientist! (kisses Rachel on the head,\nvery moved)"
Joey	 (checking the last ticket) Damnit! anybody got anything?'
Chandler	 No.'
Phoebe	 I'm still looking through mine..."
Monica	 Just double checking (does so)...no, no, no...(takes off a shoe and takes a ticket out of it) No!'
Monica	 (answering phone) Hello? Hold on. It's your boss."
Chandler	 Ah, the "I\'m sorry I rejected you" phone call. I\'m\nnot used to getting it from guys. (on the phone, getting up from the\nsofa) Hey, Steve.'
Steve	 Chandler, hi! I'm sure you've heard we filled the three\npositions. We just felt that with your maturity and experience, you\nwouldn't be happy being someone's assistant."
Chandler	 Oh no no no no, I'd love to be somebody's assistant!\nAnswering phones, getting coffee, I live for that stuff! And I'm not\ntoo mature... farts, boobies, butt cracks!"
Steve	 Chandler, you were the strongest person in the program.\nWe're offering you the position of junior copywriter."
Chandler	 Me, that guy who just said butt cracks?'
Steve	 Yes, that's right. We're excited about the level of\nsophistication you'll be bringing to the job."
Chandler	 Ok well, thanks, you won't regret it. I'll see you\ntomorrow (hangs up)."
Chandler	 What? (pause) Oh, yeah, I'm gonna be a junior\ncopywriter."
Everybody	 (excited) Oh my God, congratulations!'
Monica	 Oh sweetie, I'm so proud of you!"
Chandler	 Does that mean I get the good loving tonight?'
Monica	 You bet! No TV or anything! (she gets up from the sofa\nand goes to the kitchen area)'
Joey	 (to Chandler) Hey, that is so great about the job. '
Chandler	 Thanks, man.'
Joey	 And I like to think I had a little something to do with\nit.'
Chandler	 Really? What?'
Joey	 Well, before, with the wishbone... I didn't wish we\nwould win the lottery, I wished you'd get the job."
Chandler	 (smiling, surprised) Oh yeah? (looks towards the\nkitchen, worried) Listen, don't tell Monica, she'll rip your heart\nright out."
Joey	 Oh yeah.'
Rachel	 You know what? There is a little part of me that\nreally thought we were gonna win.'
Ross	 Me too. So much for my dinosaur/Amelia Earhart theme\npark.'
Phoebe	 You guys, what was the Powerball number again?'
Monica and Ross	 Seven.'
Phoebe	 We won.'
Rachel	 What?'
Phoebe	 We won!'
Monica	 Let me see!'
Phoebe	 Don't tear it."
Ross	 Phoebe, you don't have any of the first five numbers."
Phoebe	 I know that, but look, we've got the Powerball number,\nwe've won 3 dollars!"
Chandler	 Wow, you'd think we should get that over 20 years or\ngo for the big payout."
Phoebe	 (still very excited) I don't care, I've never won\nanything before, I can't believe this!"
Rachel	 So Pheebs, what are you going to do with your $3?'
Phoebe	 It's not all mine. We all get 50 cents."
Monica	 You know what? You can have mine.'
Chandler	 Me too.'
Joey	 Me too.'
Rachel	 Me too.'
Ross	 I guess if everybody else is...'

Joey	 (sitting in a chair) Hey guys, so I just called the\nPowerball hotline, can you believe it? Nobody won.'
Phoebe	 I beg to differ (shows him her cup of coffee and her\nplate of cookies).'
Gunther	 Maybe nobody won the jackpot, but there was this guy\nin here earlier, and he found the ticket on the street, right outside,\nand won $10,000 (goes to the counter).'
Phoebe	 (hides her mouth behind the cup and speaks in the\n"pigeon voice" from before) Coo, again. Don\'t blame the pretty lady. It\nwas not her fault. It was me, the pigeon, coo! (pause) Seriously, stop\nstaring at her.'
