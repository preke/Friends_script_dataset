Chandler	 (totally not crying) Well see now that I can see crying over, but Bambi\nis a cartoon!'
Joey	 (crying) You didn\xc2\x92t cry when Bambi\xc2\x92s mother died?'
Chandler	 Yes it was very sad when the guy stopped drawing the deer!'
Monica	 Chandler there\xc2\x92s nothing wrong with crying! I mean you don\xc2\x92t\nhave to be so macho all the time.'
Chandler	 I\xc2\x92m not macho.'
Monica	 Yeah you\xc2\x92re right. I don\xc2\x92t know what I was thinking.'
Chandler	 No, I guess I just never really cried. Y\xc2\x92know? I\xc2\x92m not a\ncrying kind of guy.'
Joey	 Come on man there\xc2\x92s gotta be something that gets you choked up! Like\nuh, uh oh, what if you saw a three-legged puppy?'
Chandler	 I\xc2\x92d be sad sure, but I wouldn\xc2\x92t cry.'
Joey	 Okay, what if the puppy said, "Help me Chandler. All the other\npuppies pick on me."'
Chandler	 Cry?! I just found a talking puppy, I\xc2\x92m rich!'
Monica	 Oh, I\xc2\x92ve got it! I have got it! (Gets up and gets something from\nthe dresser underneath the TV.) Pictures from your childhood. This will get you going\ngood!'
Phoebe	 All right, what\xc2\x92s going on there? (Points to a picture.)'
Chandler	 Oh, that\xc2\x92s Parent\xc2\x92s Day, first grade. That\xc2\x92s me with\nthe janitor Martin.'
Monica	 Where were your parents?'
Chandler	 Oh they didn\xc2\x92t want to come!'

Monica	 Poor thing!'
Phoebe	 So that story doesn\xc2\x92t make you cry?'
Chandler	 No! Look, I don\xc2\x92t cry! It\xc2\x92s not a big deal! Okay?!'

Phoebe	 Oh you\xc2\x92re my biggest fan? I\xc2\x92ve always wanted to meet you! Hi!\n(Shakes his hand.) Sure! Yeah! (Signs the autograph)'
The Fan	 Wow! Wow, thanks a lot! I just wanna say, I think you\xc2\x92re really\ntalented.'

Joey	 Oh, you\xc2\x92re Phoebe\xc2\x92s fan!'
The Fan	 Oh yeah! I\xc2\x92ve seen all her movies.'

Joey	 (laughs) I don\xc2\x92t think so.'
The Fan	 No-no, it was! She was in Sex Toy Story 2, Lawrence of Alabia, and I\ngot her autograph! The guys at the comic book store aren\xc2\x92t gonna believe this!\n(Exits.)'
Joey	 Hey Gunther, don\xc2\x92t let that guy in here anymore! He just said\nPhoebe\xc2\x92s a porn star!'
Gunther	 Well, I wouldn\xc2\x92t call her a star, but she\xc2\x92s really good. You\nshould check out Inspecther Gadget.'
Jill	 Hey!'
Rachel	 Hey!'
Jill	 You\xc2\x92ll never believe what just happened, Ross just totally blew me\noff and he didn\xc2\x92t even tell me why!'
Rachel	 Ohhh well. Y\xc2\x92know what honey? The best thing to do to get over a\nguy is to start dating someone else. Oh! There is this great guy you will love at work\nnamed Bob! He\xc2\x92s a real up-and-comer in Human Resources.'
Jill	 Y\xc2\x92know, thanks for trying to cheer me up, but I\xc2\x92m not gonna date\nsome random guy from your work.'
Rachel	 It\xc2\x92s not random, it\xc2\x92s Bob.'
Jill	 It\xc2\x92s probably because not mature enough. Or smart enough. Maybe he\ndoesn\xc2\x92t like the way I dress\xc2\x97No that can\xc2\x92t be it. It\xc2\x92s really gotta be\nthe smart thing. Oh I\xc2\x92m so stupid! I\xc2\x92m just like this incredibly pretty\nstupid girl!'
Rachel	 No honey, okay, okay, you wanna know why Ross canceled the date? Because\nI asked him to.'
Jill	 You asked him too?!'
Rachel	 Hm-mmm.'
Jill	 Why?!'
Rachel	 Because you are my sister and Ross and I have this huge history\xc2\x85'
Jill	 I don\xc2\x92t understand, do you want to go out with Ross?'
Rachel	 No.'
Jill	 You don\xc2\x92t want him, but you don\xc2\x92t want me to have him?'
Rachel	 (changing the subject) Y\xc2\x92know Bob in Human Resources\xc2\x85'
Jill	 Ugh! I cannot believe you did this too me! You had me doubting how smart I\nwas! (Gasps) You had me doubting my fashion sense!'
Rachel	 Look, this is not that big of a deal! You just don\xc2\x92t date Ross!\nThere\xc2\x92s a million other guys out there, you just\xc2\x85'
Jill	 Hey! You have no right to tell me what to do.'
Rachel	 I\xc2\x92m not telling you what to do! I am telling you what not to\ndo!'
Jill	 Why are you so jealous of me?'
Rachel	 Jill this is not about me being jealous of you! This is about you being\na brat! Wanting what you can\xc2\x92t have!'
Jill	 Can\xc2\x92t have?! Excuse me, the only thing I can\xc2\x92t have is dairy!\n(Starts to storm out.)'
Rachel	 All right, all right, well you just blew your chances at dating Bob!'
Jill	 Who?!'
Rachel	 In Human Resources!!!!!!'
Rachel	 \xc2\x85I am jealous of her?! I mean who does she think she is?! Princess\nCaroline?!'
Monica	 You\xc2\x92re jealous of Princess Caroline?'
Rachel	 Do I have my own castle?'
Ross	 Hey! Uh, Phoebe\xc2\x92s not here is she?'
Rachel	 No.'
Monica	 (noticing the bag Joey\xc2\x92s carrying) Oh great! Did you get a movie?'
Joey	 Uhhh, yeah. Yeah. But uh, I don\xc2\x92t think it\xc2\x92s the kind\nyou\xc2\x92re gonna like.'
Chandler	 You didn\xc2\x92t get more movies that are gonna have us reaching for\nthe tissues all night did you?'
Joey	 Sort of\xc2\x85'
Monica	 Guys, what\xc2\x92s going on?'
Joey	 (holds up the movie) Phoebe\xc2\x92s a porn star!'
All	 What?!!'
Chandler	 Phoebe Buffay in Buffay
Rachel	 Oh my God!'
Monica	 That\xc2\x92s Phoebe! Where did you get that?'
Joey	 Well down at the adult video place down on Bleaker.'
Ross	 And-and I, and I saw that Joey was about to go in, so I ran in ahead of\nhim to-to surprise him and, and then I pretended I didn\xc2\x92t know he was in there. (They\nall kinda look at him.)'
Rachel	 Wow! I mean, I just\xc2\x97I can\xc2\x92t, I can\xc2\x92t believe this.\nY\xc2\x92know, I mean you think you know someone even, even Phoebe who\xc2\x92s always been\nsomewhat of a question mark.'
Monica	 This is so bizarre. I guess it kinda makes sense though, y\xc2\x92know she\nhad such a terrible childhood.'
Chandler	 Hey, I had a terrible childhood and I don\xc2\x92t do porn.'
Monica	 Yes, but you are dead inside.'
Joey	 All right well, I\xc2\x92d better take that back.'
Monica	 Wh-what, why?'
Joey	 We can\xc2\x92t watch that! I mean that\xc2\x92s Phoebe!'
Monica	 Yeah you\xc2\x92re right, we can\xc2\x92t\xc2\x97we shouldn\xc2\x92t watch this.'
Rachel	 Absolutely not.'
Monica	 (hands the tape back to Joey, but doesn\xc2\x92t let him grab it)\nY\xc2\x92know maybe a little bit!'
Rachel	 Probably just the first half.'
Joey	 No! Hey no! This is wrong you guys! Phoebe\xc2\x92s our friend! Well,\nI\xc2\x92m not gonna watch it!'
Ross	 Yeah! Good for you Joe!'
Joey	 Yeah.'
Buffay, the Vampire Layer	 Ah, I thought I\xc2\x92d find you here, Nasforatool.'
The Vampire	 Buffay, are you going to plunge your stake into my dark places?'
Buffay, the Vampire Layer	 Actually, I was kinda hoping it would be the other\nway around.'
Monica	 Hold on a second! What is that on her ankle?'
Chandler	 Her ankle is what you\xc2\x92re watching?'
Rachel	 Well it\xc2\x92s hard to tell\xc2\x85 (Rachel gets up to get a closer look,\nonly she\xc2\x92s having some trouble.) Oh God, if she would just stop moving.'
Chandler	 She\xc2\x92s just doing her job!'
Joey	 (sitting at the kitchen table with his back to the TV) You sick bastards!'
Rachel	 Oh, it\xc2\x92s a tattoo! That\xc2\x92s weird, Phoebe doesn\xc2\x92t\xc2\x85\nWait that\xc2\x92s Ursula! That\xc2\x92s not Phoebe that is Ursula!'
Joey	 Re! Re! Then I can watch that! Rewind it! Rewind it!'
Phoebe	 (entering) Hey! What\xc2\x92s up? (Sees the TV) Oh my God! What am I\ndoing?!!'

Monica	 Hey sweetie!'
Chandler	 Hey! (He quickly tries to hide the book by throwing it under the\ncouch, only the couch has no back and it slides into the kitchen.)'
Monica	 (picking up the book) Chicken Soup for the Soul? '
Chandler	 There\xc2\x92s no back to this couch!'
Monica	 Why are you reading this? You hate this kind of stuff.'
Chandler	 Yeah I know, but I figured a shot y\xc2\x92know? Maybe one of those\nstories would make me cry and then you wouldn\xc2\x92t think I was y\xc2\x92know, all dead\ninside.'
Monica	 Oh that\xc2\x92s so sweet! Look Chandler I don\xc2\x92t care if you\ncan\xc2\x92t cry, I love you.'
Chandler	 Oh that makes me feel so warm in my hollow tin chest.'
Monica	 Stop it!'
Chandler	 No, I mean, come on, seriously think about it, we get married,\nwe\xc2\x92re up at the altar and I\xc2\x92m like this. (Makes a bored face.)'
Monica	 I won\xc2\x92t care, because I know you will be feeling it all in here.\n(Points to her heart.)'
Chandler	 Yeah?'
Monica	 Yeah! And if, and if we have a baby one-day, and the doctor hands it to\nyou in the delivery room and you don\xc2\x92t cry, so what! And-and-and, and if we take him\nto college and come home and see his empty room for the first time, and you got nothing,\nit won\xc2\x92t matter to me.'
Chandler	 Okay, well I won\xc2\x92t uh, worry about this anymore then.'
Monica	 And-and-and if I die, from a long illness. And you\xc2\x92re writing out\nmy eulogy and you open a desk drawer and you find a note from me that says, "I will\nalways be with you," and you still can\xc2\x92t shed one tiny tear, I know you\xc2\x92ll\nbe crying a river inside.'
Chandler	 Aww, I love you so\xc2\x85'
Monica	 What is wrong with you?!!!'
Chandler	 What?!'
Monica	 What?! You can\xc2\x92t shed a tear for your dead wife!! Now, I left you a\nnote from the beyond!'
Chandler	 So you didn\xc2\x92t mean any of that?!'
Monica	 No you robot!!'
Ross	 You damn kids! You ring my bell one more time, I swear to\xc2\x85 (Opens the\ndoor to find Jill standing there.) Ohh, uh Jill. Umm, that-that\xc2\x92s just a little game\nI play with the kids down the hall. Umm, they\xc2\x92ve really taken a liking to me.\n(Quickly looks out to see if they\xc2\x92re watching.) Uhh\nwhat\xc2\x92s-what\xc2\x92s-what\xc2\x92s the matter?'
Jill	 Rachel and I had a really big fight, can I come in? I-I mean I know\nwe\xc2\x92re not supposed to see each other anymore and I\xc2\x92m okay with that, it\xc2\x92s\njust that I don\xc2\x92t know anybody in the city and I really need somebody to talk to\nabout it.'
Ross	 Of course, what happened? (Lets her in.)'
Jill	 (entering) I don\xc2\x92t want to talk about it.'
Ross	 Okay, umm\xc2\x85'
Jill	 But you know what might really cheer me up?'
Ross	 What?'
Jill	 Seeing some more of your super-cool slides.'
Ross	 Wow! Really?!'
Jill	 Totally, I love them! And, maybe you could finish telling me about all the\ndifferent kinds of sand.'
Ross	 Well, I\xc2\x92d love to! Here, you wait right here and I\xc2\x92ll go get the\nprojector and my notes!'
Jill	 Oh great! Thanks Ross, you\xc2\x92re such a good friend!'
Ross	 Ohh!'
Rachel	 Hey! Have you guys seen Jill? I can\xc2\x92t find her anywhere.'
Monica	 No, I haven\xc2\x92t.'
Rachel	 Well, is Ross home? Maybe I\xc2\x92ll just call him to see if he\xc2\x92s\nactually seen her. '
Ursula	 Who is it?'
Phoebe	 It\xc2\x92s Phoebe! Phoebe!'
Ursula	 Hey!'
Phoebe	 (seeing her dress) Oh God. So-so you\xc2\x92re making porn movies.'
Ursula	 No I\xc2\x92m not.'
Man\xc2\x92s Voice	 We\xc2\x92re still rolling!'
Phoebe	 You\xc2\x92re making one right now!'
Another Man\xc2\x92s Voice	 Let\xc2\x92s go Phoebe!'
Phoebe	 And-and you\xc2\x92re using my name!'
Ursula	 Yeah, can I help you with something?'
Same Man\xc2\x92s Voice	 Phoebe, come on!'
Phoebe	 Look, I\xc2\x92m talking right now! You\xc2\x92re\xc2\x97you mean her.'
Ursula	 Y\xc2\x92know, twin stuff is always a real big seller.'
Phoebe	 What?!'
Ursula	 Yeah, I can talk them into giving you like, 30 dollars.'
Phoebe	 No!! No way! No! And stop using my name! And shame on you! (Yells into\nthe apartment) And shame on all of you! You\xc2\x92re disgusting! Especially you (points to\nsomeone) with that! (Storms away.)'
Ross	 Slides are almost ready.'
Jill	 Yeah. Ooh, I know what this is missing! Alcohol!'
Ross	 Uh okay, well there\xc2\x92s-there\xc2\x92s wine in the kitchen.'
Jill	 Oh great! (Goes to get it as the phone rings.)'
Ross	 (answering it) Hello?'
Rachel	 (on phone) What is my sister doing there?! And why are the\ndrapes shut?!'
Ross	 O-okay, Rach calm-calm down, okay? She-she\xc2\x92s really upset we\xc2\x92re\njust talking.'
Rachel	 Ross! I think she is trying to make something happen with you to get\nback at me!'
Ross	 So that\xc2\x92s the only reason she could be here huh? It couldn\xc2\x92t\nhave anything to do with the fact that-that maybe I\xc2\x92m a good listener and I uh I put\non a great slide show!'
Rachel	 Ross, I am telling you that she is using you to get back at me!'
Ross	 Y\xc2\x92know what? I think I can take care of myself, I\xc2\x92ll talk to you\nlater. Good-bye. (Hangs up the phone and turns to find Jill sitting really close to him.)\nWhoa! Uh, that was your sister actually. She-she thinks that you\xc2\x92re just using me.'
Jill	 So? (Kisses him passionately.)'
Phoebe	 Hey!'
Joey	 Hey!'
Phoebe	 So, I just came from the company Ursula works for.'
Joey	 Oh no, not you too!'
Phoebe	 No! No! I just went to pick up Phoebe Buffay\xc2\x92s checks; there were a\nlot of them.'
Joey	 Nice!'
Phoebe	 Um-mmm, and I won\xc2\x92t have to go there anymore because I gave\nthem my correct address.'
Joey	 That\xc2\x92s great, but isn\xc2\x92t it gonna bother that people still think\nyou\xc2\x92re a porn star?'
Phoebe	 Oh no! No! I know how to handle it.'
Joey	 You do?'
Phoebe	 Yeah. (She notices some guy putting a coat on his girlfriend is trying\nto remember where he\xc2\x92s seen her before.) (To him) You\xc2\x92re trying to figure out\nwhere you know me from? All right, I\xc2\x92ll give you a hint. From porn! Okay? (He tries\nto rush his girlfriend out.) Yeah your pervert boyfriend watched me in a porno movie! (To\nJoey) See?'
Joey	 Yeah.'
Chandler	 Hey.'
Ross	 (To Rachel) You uh, you may have been right about Jill.'
Rachel	 Oh! I knew it! What happened?'
Ross	 Umm, she kissed me.'
Rachel	 What?! You kissed!'
Chandler	 (To Monica) Maybe we should give them some privacy.'
Monica	 (To Chandler) Shhhh!!!'
Ross	 Look, I uh, I tried not to kiss her, okay?'
Rachel	 Well, it doesn\xc2\x92t sound like it! I mean, it\xc2\x92s pretty easy not\nto kiss someone, you just don\xc2\x92t kiss them! See look at us, right now, not kissing!'
Ross	 Let me finish, okay? She started kissing me and-and I didn\xc2\x92t stop it.\nI guess I-I just wasn\xc2\x92t thinking\xc2\x85'
Rachel	 Yeah that\xc2\x92s right you weren\xc2\x92t thinking! Y\xc2\x92know what? Let\nme give you something to think about! (She pulls up her sleeves and steps towards him.)'
Ross	 Oh wait\xc2\x97hold it! But then I started thinking and I stopped the\nkissing.'
Rachel	 Oh, well thank you for taking your tongue out of my sister\xc2\x92s mouth\nlong enough to tell me that.'
Ross	 Look I-I realize if anything were to happen with me and Jill then nothing\ncould ever happen with us!'
Rachel	 What?!'
Ross	 No, I mean, look I don\xc2\x92t know if anything is going to happen with us,\nagain. Ever. But I don\xc2\x92t want to know that it-it never could. So I stopped it and she\ngot mad and broke my projector.'
Rachel	 Wow. I, I don\xc2\x92t even know what to say. Thank you. (Gently kicks\nhim.)'
Ross	 You\xc2\x92re welcome. (Gently kicks her back.)'
Monica	 Oh my God! Are-are you crying?'
Chandler	 (crying hysterically) I just don\xc2\x92t see why those two can\xc2\x92t\nwork things out!'

Jill	 All right, I\xc2\x92m leaving! Because I\xc2\x92m not going to spend one more\nday with someone whose out to sabotage my every move. That\xc2\x92s you Rachel!'
Rachel	 Yeah, I got that.'
Jill	 (To Ross) And you! I throw myself at you and you say no, how gay are you?'
Ross	 You take care Jill.'
Jill	 (happily) Okay, see ya! (Exits.)'
Rachel	 Bye-bye-e!'
Monica	 Bye.'
Chandler	 (starts crying) I-I can\xc2\x92t believe Jill\xc2\x92s gone. (They all\nlook at him.) I can\xc2\x92t help it, I opened a gate.'
