Ross	 (entering) Hey everybody! Happy Thanksgiving! '
Chandler	 No, no, no. No-no-no. '
Joey, Rachel, and Phoebe	 Shhhh! '
Ross	 What, are we keeping Thanksgiving a secret this year? '
Chandler	 No, we're playing this game I learned at work. You have to name all\nthe states in six minutes. "
Ross	 What? That's like insanely easy! "
Chandler	 Now, that's a lot harder than it sounds. You always forget at least\none, or in some cases... fourteen (looks over to Monica). "
Monica	 It's a stupid game and I wasn't playing against other people, so\ntechnically I didn't lose. "
Ross	 What? You forgot fourteen states? '
Monica	 Nobody cares about the Dakotas. (That\xc2\x92s true in so many ways, trust\nme, I\xc2\x92ve lived in one and been to the other.)'
Chandler	 Oh, okay, time's up! "
Rachel	 All right, I got 48. '
Chandler	 Oh that's not bad, Pheebs? "
Phoebe	 Oh, I got tired of naming states. So I decided to list the types of\ncelery, and I have one
Chandler	 Okay, so Rachel's got 48 and Phoebe has the lead in\xc2\x85vegetables,\nJoey? "
Joey	 Say hello to the new champ of Chandler's dumb states game. "
Ross	 Wow, how many have you got? '
Joey	 Fifty-six! '

Joey	 Hey! How is New England not a state? Huh? They have a sports-team! '
Chandler	 Does South Oregon have a sports-team? (Joey strikes one from his list)\nThere you go. '
Rachel	 (counting the place settings) How come we have one extra place setting? '
Monica	 'Cause you invited your assistant. "
Rachel	 Oh, right. Sorry. But Tag's not coming; his girlfriend came into town,\nso he's spending Thanksgiving with her. "
Monica	 Oh! Why didn't you tell me? I made him his own individual sweet potato\nstuffed pumpkin. "
Rachel	 Well, I was going to, but then I figured, you know... you're food is so\ndelicious and perfect, you can never have too many of those pumpkin things. "
Monica	 Now you think I wouldn't enjoy that, because it is so fake, (Laughs) but\nI still do."
Phoebe	 Regular Celery! (Starts to write that on her list) Oh, I already have\nthat. (She gets up and heads for her room) '
Ross	 Done! With time a-to-spare. '
Chandler	 Oooh that may be a New World's record (Looks at his watch and picks up\nRoss' pad) "
Ross	 You know, I hate to lecture you guys, but it\'s kinda disgraceful, that a\ngroup of well-educated adults and Joey can\'t name all the states. Did you ever see a map,\nor one of those round, colorful things called "a globe?" Hmm? '
Chandler	 Uh, Magellan? You got 46 states. (Smiles and hands Ross back his pad) '
Ross	 What? That's impossible. "
Joey	 46. Wow! Who's well educated now, Mr. I-forgot-ten-states? "
Monica	 All right, I'm out of oven space. I'm gonna turn on Joey's. Please,\nwatch him! Do not let Joey eat any of the food! "
Chandler	 I am only one man! (Monica heads out) Okay Ross, time is up! '
Ross	 No, just give me another minute. '
Chandler	 Look Ross, if you don't know them by now, you will never know them,\nokay? That is the beauty of this game. It makes you want to kill yourself. "
Ross	 This-this is crazy! I can do this! All right, uhh, I bet I can get all 50\nbefore dinner. '
Chandler	 Okay, but if you can't\xc2\x85no dinner! "
Ross	 You're on! "
Joey	 (gets up) All right. Don't look at my list, Ross, 'cause there's a lot on\nthere that you don't have. "
Monica	 (entering, to Joey and Rachel) Hey, did you guys know, that your oven\ndoesn't work? "
Joey	 But the drawer full of take-out menus is okay, right? '
Monica	 Ross, I'm gonna use yours, okay? "
Ross	 Pshhshhh!'
Monica	 Chandler? Can you give me a hand? (Grabs her jacket) '
Chandler	 Sure, and Joey; do not let Ross look at any of the maps or the globe\nin your apartment. '
Joey	 Don't worry, Chandler, it's not a globe of the United States. "
Phoebe	 Hey you guys I'm gonna go out and take a walk. "
Ross	 Phoebe, why is your bag moving? '
Phoebe	 Oh, it's not! "
Rachel	 Seriously, it's moving! "
Joey	 What the hell is in there? '
Phoebe	 It's just my knitting that's all! (A dog sticks its head out of Phoebe's\nbag. Everyone looks puzzled.) Yes! I knit this. I'm very good. "
Monica	 Ross\xc2\x92s apartment is nice! How come we don't hang out here more\noften? "
Chandler	 I don't know. Maybe it's because it smells a little weird. It's like\nold pumpkins or something. "
Monica	 That's my pie! "
Chandler	 Which smells delicious! '
Monica	 Uh-oh! Uh-oh! '
Chandler	 What? '
Monica	 We left Joey alone with the food! (Walks towards the window and looks\nout) Yep! Yep, I knew it! There he is... feeding stuffing to a dog! '
Phoebe	 (answering the phone) Hi Geller-Bing residence. How can I help?'
Monica	 Phoebe, why is there a dog in our apartment? '
Phoebe	 I'm sorry, who's this? "
Monica	 Phoebe, there's a dog sitting on my couch! "
Chandler	 Tell her, I'm allergic, and I will sue! "
Phoebe	 No, there's no dog here? "
Monica	 Yes there is! He's black and white and shaggy and [Cut to Monica\xc2\x92s\napartment] he's sitting next to Rachel and licking Rachel's hand. "
Phoebe	 Oh my god! Where are you? (Looks around.)'
Monica	 I'll be right there! "
Phoebe	 (Phoebe hangs up and someone knocks on the door. She gasps.) They're\nhere already? How are they doing this? "
Rachel	 (gets up and opens the door) Hi Tag! What are you doing here? '
Tag	 I, uh, wanted to see if your offer to spend Thanksgiving with you is still\ngood. '
Rachel	 Well, sure! Come in! (He enters) Well, what-what happened to your\ngirlfriend? '
Tag	 We kinda broke up this morning. '
Rachel	 Oh, I'm sorry. "
Tag	 Yeah, so she went back to Ohio.'
Ross	 Ohio!! Thank you! '
Chandler	 Huh! Where is the dog?!'
Ross	 What dog? There-there's no dog here. "
Joey	 Yeah that dog left! '
Monica	 (walks to Phoebe's door) Phoebe! Phoebe, open up! "
Phoebe	 There's no dog in here. "
Chandler	 Phoebe, we can hear the dog barking! '
Phoebe	 No that's just me coughing! (Doing some weird coughing noises and the\ndog barks again. Phoebe comes out of the room.) Oh, good, there you are! Listen, um, I\nhave a dog in my room. "
Chandler	 What is it doing here? '
Phoebe	 Well, I'm watching it for some friends who went out of town. Wait. (She\nbends down, picks up the dog, and waves with one of its paws) Hello, my name is Clunkers.\nMay I please stay with you nice people?"
Monica	 Oooh, I wish she could stay here, but Chandler is allergic! '
Chandler	 Extremely allergic, okay? If I'm anywhere near a dog for more than 5\nminutes, my throat will just close up! "
Phoebe	 That's odd, 'cause this dog's been living here for the past 3 days "
Chandler	 (gasping) Really? '
Monica	 Chandler, if that dog's been here that long, and you haven't had a\nreaction, maybe you're not allergic to this dog? "
Chandler	 Well, it still has to go, right?'
Monica and Phoebe	 Why? '
Chandler	 Okay, it's um\xc2\x85"
Joey	 (interrupting him) Don't do it! "
Monica	 Don't do what? "
Chandler	 (to Joey) I have to! Okay? It\'s time! (Joey shrugs as if to say,\n"Do what you have to do") Okay, I hate dogs. '
All	 What? '
Phoebe	 Are you crazy? '
Ross	 Are you out of your mind?'
Phoebe	 Why? '
Joey	 Told ya. (Waves bye-bye.)'
Chandler	 They are needy, they are jumpy, and you can't tell what they are\nthinking, and that scares me a little bit. "
Ross	 Right, they are scary. (He jumps up, screaming) Ahh, she just ate a treat\nout of my hand!!!'
Rachel	 Wait a minute. Do you not like all dogs? I mean, not even puppies? '
Chandler	 (scared) Is there a puppy here? '
Tag	 You don't like puppies? "
Chandler	 (to Tag) Okay, you are new!'
Joey	 Look, Chandler, I told you, never tell anyone about this dog thing. It's\nlike Ross not likin\xc2\x92 ice cream. "
Phoebe	 You don't like ice cream? "
Ross	 It's too cold. "
Chandler	 Okay, it's just that dogs make me a little uncomfortable. "
Ross	 (to Phoebe) It hurts my teeth.'
Chandler	 And I don't wanna say this, I don't you guys to hate me, but uh, I\ndon't think, I can be around that dog anymore. Okay, so either the dog goes, or I go. (An\nawkward silence ensues.) Oh my god!!"
Ross	 How can I not get this? I'm a college professor; I got 1450 on my S.A.T.s.\n"
Monica	 1250.'
Ross	 Damn, I forgot you were here. '
Phoebe	 All right. We're gonna take Clunkers to Ross\xc2\x92s. We'll be back in a\nminute. (Gets up with Monica to do so.)"
Rachel	 Oh, wait before you guys go, can I just ask you a question? '
Monica	 Yeah. '
Rachel	 When a guy breaks up with his girlfriend, what is an appropriate amount\nof time to wait before you make a move? '
Phoebe	 Oh, I'd say about a month. "
Monica	 Really? I'd say 3 to 4. "
Joey	 Half hour. (Rachel turns to look at him and he nods yes.)'
Rachel	 Interesting. '
Monica	 When it's your assistant, I would say never. "
Joey	 All right, Rach, the big question is, does he like you? All right? Because\nif he doesn't like you, this is all a moo-point. "
Rachel	 Huh. A moo-point? '
Joey	 Yeah, it's like a cow's opinion. It just doesn't matter. It's moo. "
Rachel	 (to Monica and Phoebe) Have I been living with him for too long, or did\nthat all just make sense?'
Monica	 Please, don't listen to Joey, okay. Would you look at him? He-he\xc2\x92s\nobviously depressed. He's away from his family; he's spending Thanksgiving with strangers.\n\xc2\xa0 What he needs right now is for you to be his friend. "
Rachel	 You're right, I'm sorry. Thank you. Okay, that's what I'm gonna do. "
Joey	 Fine! Take their advice. No one ever listens to me. When the package is\nthis pretty, no one cares what's inside. "
Rachel	 Hey! '
Tag	 Hey. '
Rachel	 How are you holding up? '
Tag	 Not bad. '
Rachel	 Yeah? I'm sorry about your girlfriend. "
Tag	 Thanks. '
Rachel	 So were you guys together a long time? '
Tag	 A year. On and off. I kinda thought we'd end up together. I don't anymore. "
Rachel	 Now that she broke up with you? '
Tag	 Yeah. '
Rachel	 Yeah. Hmmmm. '
Tag	 It's weird. I always used to assume, that I would meet someone and fall in\nlove and be happy and all that was just a given. But lately it's like what if it's not. Do\nyou ever have that feeling? "
Rachel	 No\xc2\x85Yeah, all the time, constantly. It's terrifying. But you know\nthat I figure it\xc2\x85it has to work out. "
Tag	 Why? '
Rachel	 Because, uh\xc2\x97it has to. '
Tag	 You have all the answers, don't you? "
Rachel	 Yeah, I know, I do. I really do. '
Tag	 Hey, thanks for talking to me. '
Rachel	 Well, what is a boss for? Hug it out! (They hug) '
Joey	 (through the window) All right, he likes you back! Huh? Told ya, you\nshould go for it! '
Tag	 What? '
Joey	 (realizes what he said) Street noise drowned any of that out? (Rachel\nmoves madly towards him) No, all right, I see you later, okay... (Turns away embarrassed) '

Tag	 What did Joey say? I like you back? '
Rachel	 Uh, yeah, well, see, he\xc2\x85 Joey knows, that I'm-I'm very insecure\nabout my back and, and\xc2\x85you're hugging me, so obviously you are not repulsed by it,\nyeah!"
Tag	 Wait-wait a minute; that doesn't make any sense. "
Rachel	 No? (He shakes his head) All right, here's the truth um, Joey said what\nhe said, because um, I'm attracted to you. "
Tag	 Wow. (He starts to walk towards the railing.) '
Rachel	 Yeah, I admit it. I have a crush on you, and uh, and, and I know that's\ncrazy because we work together, and-and nothing could ever happen, and the last thing I\nwant to do is-is to freak you out or make you feel uncomfortable. Which is why it would be\nreally great if you said something right about now. "
Tag	 (looking at the street) Oh my god! Those guys are stealing my car! (He\npoints down to the street) '
Rachel	 What? '
Tag	 Right there! That's my car! (Sound of a breaking car-window) Hey!! "
Rachel	 Okay, that's gonna take them a minute. Do you have anything else you\nwanna get off your chest? "
Tag	 I can't believe this! (He walks back in again) "
Rachel	 (she hurries after him) Wait, we still have time to talk and\nthey\xc2\x92re-they're not even in the car yet! (She takes a quick look down the street.) Oh\nlook, there they go, okay. (She hurries in, too) "
Monica	 Okay Phoebe, we should probably go back now. '
Phoebe	 (doing Clunkers) Please don't leave me, I'll be lonely. "
Monica	 Stop it. Stop! Okay let's go. We can be strong."
Phoebe	 Yeah, okay. '
Monica	 Oh my god! Did you hear that? She said Monica! (She goes back to\nClunkers again) Oooh, I can't leave her! "
Phoebe	 You know if you want, we can sneak the dog back in and Chandler wouldn't\neven know. "
Monica	 That's not gonna work. "
Phoebe	 I've had that dog there for three days and Chandler had no idea. He's\nnot so smart. "
Monica	 Hey! I didn't know either. "
Phoebe	 Yeah, but you kinda knew that something was going on, didn't you? "
Monica	 Yeah, I knew. '
Phoebe	 Where's Chandler? "
Chandler	 (comes out of the bathroom) Here I am. '
Phoebe	 Wash your hands!!!'
Chandler	 How did you\xc2\x85know? (Heads back into the bathroom) '
Ross	 Hey! What's she doing back here? "
Monica	 Relax, Ross. She's not made of ice cream! "
Ross	 Hey look, Phoebe. I, uh, I laid out the states geographically... '
Phoebe	 (interrupts him) No, no, we don't really have time for this right now.\nOkay, we have to keep Chandler away from my bedroom. "
Ross	 Yeah, but, but look what I'm... "
Phoebe	 See, this is exactly what we do not have time for. (She rushes into her\nroom) '
Chandler	 (comes out of the bathroom) Where's Monica? "
Ross	 Um, in Phoebe's room. You can't go in there. "
Chandler	 Why not? '
Ross	 Monica's crying. She's very upset about this whole Clunkers thing. "
Chandler	 Well, I, I should go in there. '
Ross	 No. No, no. She doesn't want to see you right now. "
Chandler	 Why not? '
Ross	 Because you sent away the dog!'
Chandler	 This is ridiculous. (He heads for Phoebe's bedroom) "
Ross	 Oh, is it? Is it? Look, when Monica and I were kids, we had a dog\nnamed Rover. And, uh, one day, my dad decides, he doesn't like dogs. So Monica and her\nfriend\xc2\x85Phyllis\xc2\x85take away the dog. And that was the last time we ever saw him.\nDon't you see? This is just like that. Only with a few details changed. "
Joey	 (entering) Okay, I'm in my sweat pants. Bring on the food! (Sees that\nChandler has a worried look on his face) What's the matter? "
Chandler	 Monica's all upset, because I sent Clunkers away. "
Joey	 So? Bring the dog back, you're a hero. "
Chandler	 Yeah, I can be a hero, I could do that. I could, I could do... I,\nw-w-what if, what if it attacks me? '
Joey	 Chandler, it's like a big gerbil."
Chandler	 And that doesn't scare you? (He walks out) "
Joey	 Ross, you need some help? '
Ross	 From you? (He does a weird desperate laughter, like he's almost crying)\nYes, please! "
Joey	 (sits down next to Ross) First of all, Utah? Dude, you can't just make\nstuff up!"
Ross	 I hate America! When I finish this game, I swear I am moving. '
Joey	 Hey! Tag's still talking to the police. "
Rachel	 Yeah, ohh! Why, damnit, why did I open my mouth? (In a girlish voice) I\nhave a crush on you; I am attracted to you. (Back to normal again) Gee, I-I know that I\nfreaked him out '
Joey	 If you said it like that, you probably did, yeah. '
Phoebe	 (opens her bedroom door and peeks out) Hey, is Chandler here? '
Chandler	 No, no he went for a walk. '
Phoebe	 Okay, but you cannot tell him... but look whose back! '
Rachel	 (gasps) Hi! '
Joey	 Oh No-no-no-no-no-no-no! He went over to Ross' to bring the dog back here!\n"
Phoebe	 Oh no, the dog's not going to be there! "
Joey	 You think? '
Monica	 Hi, honey. '
Chandler	 Please, please, please, don't be mad at me. "
Monica	 What? Why, why would... '
Phoebe	 (interrupts her, to Monica) Shh, wait and see. Maybe we will, maybe we\nwon't. "
Chandler	 Okay, I went over to Ross' apartment to bring back Clunkers.\nY\xc2\x92know, for you, and\xc2\x85(Clears his throat) I left the door open and she must have\ngotten out and I looked everywhere, all over the apartment, including the roof,\nwhich FYI Ross, one of your neighbors, growing weed. I couldn't find him, and I am so, so,\nso, sorry. But I do know where we could all go ease the pain. (Points up and then\nover to the street) "
Phoebe	 We have good news, look whose back! '
Rachel	 (uncovers the dog) Hi! '
Chandler	 Clunkers?! Oh my god! '
Monica	 That's right, she came back all by herself. "
Phoebe	 It's a Thanksgiving miracle! "
Chandler	 (to Clunkers) It is so good to see you! '
Phoebe	 Yeah, she came all the way back from Ross' building. Oh, the things she\nmust have seen! And then she climbed up the fire escape and she tapped on the window with\nher teeny little paw and then we ran to let her in\xc2\x85(Realizes, that Chandler starts to\nnot believing her) I went to far, didn't I? When should I have stopped? "
Ross	 Okay, maybe this is so hard, because there aren't 50 states. Let me tell\nyou something, I have 49 states, and there are no more! I-I think, I should be able\nto eat something. "
Chandler	 It's up to you. "
Rachel	 Oh, hi! How are you doing? '
Tag	 I'm okay. I gotta go down to the police station and look at mug shots. "
Rachel	 Oh. '
Tag	 Thanks for having me over, you guys. '
Ross	 Tag? Y-You're going? (Comes over to Tag) Uh we didn't, uh we didn't get\nthe chance to talk. Uh, so, where did you say you're from again? "
Tag	 Colorado. '
Ross	 Ah, what good are you. (Walks back to his map dejectedly.) '
Rachel	 Look, um, I think we should talk about what happened on the terrace. '
Tag	 Okay. '
Rachel	 Ah, I-I never should have said what I said. It\xc2\x97y\xc2\x92know what? It\njust doesn't matter how I feel. I mean we work together, so nothing could really ever\nhappen between us, and what I would love is just to go to work on Monday, and-and never\ntalk about this again, okay? Big day Monday lots to do. So, we're okay? "
Tag	 Um, I'm not. "
Rachel	 Oh, god, I know it, that I freaked you out. '
Tag	 No, you didn't. The only thing that freaked me out was you saying that\nnothing could ever happen between us. "
Rachel	 Really? '
Tag	 Yeah, so, please don't fire me for doing this. (He kisses her) "
Rachel	 Okay, well, that's one less thing we have to do on Monday. "

Ross	 Delaware! (Starting to cry.) Delaware!'
Chandler	 All right. '
Ross	 (hands Chandler his pad and walks in) I want my turkey now! '
Chandler	 You got it. (Starts looking at the pad, while Ross got the turkey out\nof the fridge and starts to unwrap and it) You got Nevada twice. '
Ross	 (pauses) I know. '
Chandler	 Yeah. (Throws the pad on the table and heads for the bedroom)'
