Joey	 I'm tellin' ya that girl totally winked at me."
All	 Did not, she did not wink at you...(sees that their sacred couch is\noccupied by strangers).'
Chandler	 Huh. (They all leave, dejected)'

Ross	 I have to say Tupolo Honey by Van Morrison.'
Rachel	 Nooo Way! The most romantic song ever is The Way We Were.'
Phoebe	 See, I-I think that one that Elton John wrote for, um, that guy on Who's\nThe Boss."
Rachel	 What song was that, Pheebs?'
Phoebe	 (singing) Hold me close, young Tony Dan-za.'
Phoebe	 Hi Monica!'
Ross	 Hey Mon!'
Rachel	 Hey Mon!'
Phoebe	 Oh my God, has she slept at all?'
Ross	 Nope.'
Rachel	 No, it's been three nights in a row."
Ross	 Yeah, she finally stopped crying yesterday, but then she found one of\nRichard's cigar butts out on the terrace, so."
Phoebe	 Oh, okay that explains it. I got a call at two in the morning, but all I\ncould hear was, like, this high squeaky sound, so I thought okay its like a mouse or a\nopossum. But then I realized where would a mouse or a opossum get the money to make the\nphone call.'
Chandler	 Morning.'
Joey	 Morning, hey, you made pancakes?'
Chandler	 Yeah, like there's any way I could ever do that."
Janice	 (entering and singing) Monica and Rachel had syrup, now I can get my man\nto cheer up. (laughs hysterically) Good morning Joey.'
Joey	 (sarcastically) Good morning.'
Chandler	 Hey, you know what, here's a thought. Why don't you stay home from\nwork today and just hang out with me."
Janice	 Oh, I wish. Look, honey, you have that report to finish, and I gotta go\nsee my lawyer. '
Chandler	 I can not believe that I am going out with someone that is getting\ndivorced. I'm such a grown up."
Janice	 (laughs) I-I-I gotta go, I gotta go. Okay, not without a kiss.'
Chandler	 Well, maybe I won't kiss you, and then you'll have to stay."
Joey	 (under his breath) Kiss her! Kiss her!'
Janice	 I'll see you later, sweetie. Bye Joey."
Joey	 B-bye Janice. So when ya' dumpin' her."
Chandler	 Nope, not this time.'
Joey	 Come on, quite yankin' me."
Chandler	 I'm not yanking you."
Joey	 This is Janice.'
Chandler	 Yeah, I know. She makes me happy.'
Joey	 Okay. All right. You look me in the eye and tell me, without blinking,\nthat you're not breaking up with her. No blinking."
Chandler	 (looks him in the eye) I'm not breaking up with her! (they stare at\neach other for a while, then Joey blows in his face)"
Monica	 God, look what I found in the drain.'
Rachel	 What?!'
Monica	 It's some of Richard's hair! (holds it close to Ross) What do I do with\nthis?"
Ross	 Getting it away from me would be job one.'
Monica	 It's weird, but you know what I don't wanna throw this away. I mean this\nis like all I have left of him, gross, drain hair. Ooh! (drops it in Ross's cereal)"
Phoebe	 Ooh. Oh. It looks like, like a tiny little person drowning in your\ncereal. (Ross gives her this look, like 'Yeah, doesn't it', and gets up to dump it down\nthe drain.)"
Monica	 God, what is wrong with me.'
Ross	 You need to get some sleep.'
Monica	 I need to get some Richard.'
Rachel	 Monica, you broke up with him for a reason.'
Monica	 I know, I know. I'm just so tired of-of missing him. I'm tired of\nwondering why hasn't he called. Why hasn't he called!"
Phoebe	 Maybe, because you told him not to.'
Monica	 What are you the memory woman?'
Joey	 (entering) Their not breaking up. Chandler and Janice. Their not breaking\nup. He didn't blink or anything."
Rachel	 Well, you know I'm not surprised. I mean have you seen them together,\nthey're really cute."
Joey	 Cute! This is Janice! You remember Janice?'
Rachel	 Yes, Joey, I remember, she's annoying, but you know what she's-she's his\ngirlfriend now. I mean what can we do?"
Joey	 There you go! That's the spirit I'm looking for! What can we do? Huh? All\nright who's first? Huh? Ross?"
Ross	 Well I'm thinking that Chandler's our friend and Janice makes him happy,\nso I say we just all be adult about it and accept her."
Joey	 Yeah, we'll call that Plan B. All right?"
Rachel	 (she leans over and kisses him on the cheek) Honey, I was wondering....'
Ross	 Hmm?'
Rachel	 Do you still have that, um, Navy uniform?'
Ross	 Nooo, I had to return it to the costume place.'
Rachel	 Hmm.'
Ross	 I think I have an old band uniform from high school.'
Rachel	 You remember not having sex in high school, right?'
Ross	 Yeah.'
Rachel	 Well honey, what about you?'
Ross	 What?'
Rachel	 I mean do you have any fun, you know, fantasy type things?'
Ross	 No.'
Rachel	 Come on you gotta have one!'
Ross	 Nope.'
Rachel	 Ross, you know what...'
Ross	 What?'
Rachel	 ...if you tell me, I might do it.'
Ross	 Okay, umm. Did you ever see, um, Return Of The Jedi?'
Rachel	 Yeah.'
Ross	 Do you remember the scene with, um, Jabba the Hut? Well Jabba had as, as\nhis prisoner, um, Princess Leia. '
Rachel	 Oooh!'
Ross	 Princess Leia, was wearing this, um, gold bikini thing. It was pretty\ncool.'
Phoebe	 Yeah, oh, Princess Leia and the gold bikini, every guy our age loved\nthat.'
Rachel	 Really!'
Phoebe	 Um, um. It's huge. Yeah, that's the moment, when-when, you know she\nstopped being a princess, and became, like, a woman, you know."
Rachel	 Did you ever do the-the Leia thing?'
Phoebe	 Oh, yeah, um-mm. Oh!'
Rachel	 Really! That-that great huh?'
Phoebe	 No it's just that I got this new pager and I have it on vibrate. See ya!"
Ross	 (entering with Monica in tow) Hey!'
Rachel	 Hi you guys!'
Ross	 Look who I found standing outside of the Szechwan Dragon staring at a\nparking meter.'
Rachel	 Mon. Hi! '
Monica	 Hi.'
Rachel	 Why aren't you at work?"
Monica	 Oh, they-they sent me home.'
Rachel	 Why?'
Monica	 Because I don't work at the Szechwan Dragon."
Ross	 Okay.'
Rachel	 You really, really need to get some sleep, honey.'
Monica	 I know I do.'
Ross	 Hi.'
Rachel	 Hi.'
Ross	 Guess what?'
Rachel	 What?'
Ross	 They published my paper.'
Rachel	 Oh, really, let me see, let me see.'
Phoebe	 Rach, look! (she holds two buns up to her ears to make her hair look\nlike the Princess Leia 'do.) Oh, hi! Where is my strong Ross Skywalker to come rescue me.\n(Ross stands up horrified) There he is."
Chandler	 Hey!'
Joey	 Wheel!'
Chandler	 Of!'
Joey	 Fortune! This guy is so stupid. (yelling) It's Count Rushmore!!"
Chandler	 You know, you should really go on this show. All right, listen, I got\nthree tickets to the Rangers tonight. What'd ya' say?"
Joey	 I say, 'I am there!' Cool! Aw, is Ross going to?"
Chandler	 No, Janice.'
Joey	 Jan-ice. 'Cause I, just, I feel bad for Ross, you know, we-we always go\ntogether, we're like the three hocke-teers."
Chandler	 You know, I may be way out on a limb here, but do you, do you, have a\nproblem with Janice?'
Joey	 No, Yeeees. God, how do I say this. (walks into the kitchen, Chandler\nfollows closely, he turns around and gets startled). Oh, hi, you know that girl from the\nGreek restaurant with the hair (holds his hands up to signify she has big hair)?'
Chandler	 Ooh, that girl that I hate, eww, drives me crazy, eww, eww, oh!'
Joey	 Look, I don't hate Janice, she's-she's just a lot to take, you know."
Chandler	 Well, there you go.'
Joey	 Oh, hey. Come on man, don't look at me like that, she used to drive you\nnuts before too, remember?"
Chandler	 Well, I'm crazy about her now. I think this could be the real thing.\nCapital 'R'! Capital 'T'! (Joey stares at him) Don't worry, those are the right letters."
Joey	 Look, what do you want me to say?'
Chandler	 I want you to say that you like her!'
Joey	 I can't. It's like this chemical thing, you know. Every time she starts\nlaughing, I just wanna (grimaces and tenses up) pull my arm off just so that I can have\nsomething to throw at her. "
Chandler	 Thanks for trying. (grabs the ticket and starts to leave) Oh, and by\nthe way there is no Count Rushmore!'
Joey	 Yeah, then-then who's the guy that painted the faces on the mountain?\n(Chandler gives him a look like 'You stupid idiot!')"

Ross	 How could you have told her? '
Rachel	 Ross, I didn't think it would that big of a deal."
Ross	 Oh, she didn't think it would be that big of deal."
Rachel	 Okay, who are you talking to when you do that?'
Ross	 Look, that was supposed to be like a private, personal thing between us.'
Rachel	 Okay, Ross, Phoebe is my girlfriend, okay, we tell each other\neverything. You know, I mean, come on, guys do the same thing, I mean, what about all that\nlocker room stuff.'
Ross	 That's different, okay. That's like, uh 'Who dated a stripper?' or 'Who\ndid it on the back of the Staton Island Ferry?'."
Rachel	 Were both of those Joey?'
Ross	 Yeah. Look, you don't, you don't talk about like, you know, your\ngirlfriend and the intimate stuff you, you do with her."
Rachel	 Not even with your best friend.'
Ross	 Noo!'
Rachel	 That is so sad. Your missing out on so much, Ross. I mean, the bonding\nand the sharing, you know. And-and knowing that someone else is going through the same\nthing you are.'
Ross	 Hmph. So what you, you tell each other everything?'
Rachel	 Pretty much.'
Ross	 Did you talk about the night of five times? Do you tell people about the\nnight of five times? '
Rachel	 Uh, honey, yeah that was with Carol.'
Ross	 I know, but it's still worth mentioning, I think."
Phoebe	 ( in a soothing voice) Relax every muscle in your body. Listen to the\nplinky-plunky music. Okay, now close you eyes, and think of a happy place. Okay, tell me\nyour happy place.'
Monica	 Richard's living room, drinking wine."
Phoebe	 All right. No, no, no, not a Richard thing, just put down the glass. And\nget out!'
Monica	 I'm sorry, but that's my happy place."
Phoebe	 Well, okay, fine, use my happy place. Okay, I'm just gonna, I have to\nask that you don't move anything."
Monica	 All right, I'll try not to."
Phoebe	 Okay, all right, so, your in a meadow, millions of stars in the sky....'
Monica	 Do you think breaking up with him was a huge mistake?'
Phoebe	 All right, there are no questions in the happy place. Okay, just, the\nwarm breeze, and the moonlight flowing through the trees....'
Monica	 I'll bet he's totally over me, I'll bet he's fine."
Phoebe	 All right, betting and wagering of any kind, are, I'm sure, not\npermitted in the happy place. Okay. Just-just, you know, the-the lovely waterfalls, and\nthe, the trickling fountains. And the-the calming sounds of the babbling brook...."
Monica	 Okay, this isn't working. I'm still awake and now I have to pee."
Janice	 So, I hear, you hate me!'
Joey	 I, ah, I never said hate, I was very careful about that.'
Janice	 A little birdie told me something about you wanting to rip your arm off\nand throw it at me.'
Joey	 And you got a 'hate' from that?! Your taking a big leap there..."
Janice	 All right, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, we've got to do something about\nour little situation here Joey. So, this is my idea
Joey	 But what does that gonna do...'
Janice	 For Chandler!'
Joey	 Okay. I'm in."
Janice	 Okay. All right. This is what we're gonna call it
Joey	 Does it have to be a whole day?'
Janice	 Yes, because that's how long it takes to love me."
Joey	 Yeah, I know, I sleep in the next room.'
Monica	 (crying) So, I went down to the post office, and it turns out it was\nthose videos that I ordered for Richard about the Civil War. He loved the Civil War.'
Phoebe	 Monica, do you want us to take you home?'
Monica	 Uh, huh. (to Ross) Or maybe to a galaxy far, far away. (Rachel, Monica,\nand Phoebe leave)'
Ross	 Women tell each other everything. Did you know that?'
Chandler	 Umm, yeah.'
Ross	 No Chandler, everything! Like stuff you like, stuff she likes, technique,\nstamina, girth....'
Chandler	 Girth? Why, why, why, wh-why, why, why, why would they do this? '
Ross	 Rachel says sharing's great and supposedly, you know, we outta be doing\nit. Do you wanna?"
Chandler	 We're not gonna talk about girth are we?"
Ross	 Nooo!'
Chandler	 Yeah, okay.'
Ross	 Yeah?'
Chandler	 Yeah! All right! You go first.'
Ross	 Okay, okay, I'll go first."
Chandler	 Okay.'
Ross	 So, uh, the other night Rachel and I are in bed talking about fantasies,\nand I happened to describe a particular Star Wars thing....'
Chandler	 Princess Leia in the gold bikini.'
Ross	 Yes! '
Chandler	 I know!'
Ross	 Yes! Wow, well, that-that was easy. Okay, you-you go.'
Chandler	 Okay.'
Ross	 Okay.'
Chandler	 Okay, you know, you know when your in bed, with a woman.'
Ross	 Hmph.'
Chandler	 And, ah, you know, your fooling around with her. And you get all these\nlike, mental images in your brain, you know, like Elle MacPherson, or that girl at the\nXerox place....'
Ross	 With the belly-button ring? Oh, muhawa!'
Chandler	 I know, And then all of the sudden your Mom pops into your head. And\nyour like 'Mom, get outta here!' You know, but of course, like, after that you can't\npossibly think of anything else, and you can't, you know, stop what your doing. So it's\nkinda like, you're, you know. You know...(Ross just stares at him). You don't know!"
Ross	 Your Mom, your telling me, your telling me, about your Mom, what is the\nmatter with you?'
Chandler	 You said...'
Ross	 I said 'share' not 'scare'. Go sit over there! (Chandler\ngoes over and sits at a table and puts his head down)."
Janice	 We're baack!"
Joey	 Hey!'
Chandler	 What are you guys doing together?'
Janice	 Joey and Janice's DAY OF FUN!!! (laughs)"
Chandler	 Really.'
Joey	 Yeah, yeah. We went to a Mets game, we got Chinese food, and you know, I\nlove this woman. You have got competition buddy.'
Janice	 I just came by to give you a kiss, I have to go pick up the baby, so.\nI'll see you later sweetheart, you too Chandler. (laughs)"
Chandler	 You still can't stand her can you?"
Joey	 I'm sorry man, I tired, I really did."
Chandler	 Well, you know, I appreciate you giving it a shot.'
Joey	 But, hey, look, you know the good thing is, is that we spent the whole day\ntogether and I survived, and what's even more amazing, so did she. It was bat day at Shea\nStadium."
Chandler	 Well, I guess that's something."
Joey	 No man, that's huge! Now, I know I can stand to be around her, which means\nI get to hang out with you, which is kinda the whole point, anyway."
Chandler	 Okay.'
Joey	 Oh, hey, Chandler, we, ah, we stopped by the coffee shop and ran into\nRoss.'
Chandler	 Oh God!'
Joey	 Hey, if it makes you feel any better, I do it too.'
Chandler	 Really?'
Joey	 Oh yeah, I always picture your Mom when I'm having sex."
Video	April Twelve, Eighteen hundred, Sixty-One (Monica lights\nRichard's cigar butt), 4
Monica	 Hi, Dad, what are you doing here?'
Mr. Geller	 Well, it's your mother's bridge night so I thought that I would come\ninto the city for a little Monicuddle. (hugs her) Since when did you start smoking cigars?"
Monica	 I don't, I just, I just like the smell of them. So, uh, what are you\nreally doing here Dad?"
Mr. Geller	 Well, I just wanted to make sure you were okay.'
Monica	 What makes you think that I might not be okay?'
Mr. Geller	 I saw Richard.'
Monica	 Oh.'
Mr. Geller	 So, how are you doing?'
Monica	 I'm fine, just a little tired, I'm okay. How's Richard doing?"
Mr. Geller	 You don't wanna know."
Monica	 No, I really, really do.'
Mr. Geller	 Well, he's doing terrible!"
Monica	 Really!'
Mr. Geller	 Worse than when he broke up with Barbara.'
Monica	 You're not just saying that are you?"
Mr. Geller	 No, the man is a mess.'
Monica	 Was he crying?'
Mr. Geller	 No.'
Monica	 Well, do you think he was waiting 'til after you left, so he could cry?"
Mr. Geller	 Maybe.'
Monica	 I think so.'
Mr. Geller	 Honey, relationships are hard. Like with your Mom and me. You know\nafter we graduated college we broke up for a while. It seems her Father, your Grandfather,\nwanted her to travel around Europe, like he did. Of course, he got to do it on Uncle Sam's\nnickel, because he was also strafing German troop trains at the time. However, (turns\naround and sees that Monica is sleeping and puts a blanket around her, kisses her, picks\nup the cigar, and starts watching the video)"

Rachel	 Okay, here we go. I'm Jabba's prisoner, and you have a really weird look\non your face. What? Honey, what is it? Did I get it wrong? Did I get the hair wrong? What?\nDid you just picture it differently? What? What?"
Ross	 No, no it's, um, it's not you, um, it's um, it's (turns and sees his Mom\nstanding where Rachel is)"
Mrs. Geller	 Well what is it? Come on sweetie, your like, freaking me\nout here.'
Ross	 I hate Chandler, the bastard ruined my life. (Rachel starts looking around\nand down, with a 'What the hell is going on?' look on her face.)"
