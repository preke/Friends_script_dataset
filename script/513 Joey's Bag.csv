Monica	 I can't believe we've never done this before! It's sooo good! So\ngood for Monica! "
Chandler	 Oh! Look at that, time's up! My turn!"
Monica	 That was a half an hour?'
Chandler	 It's your timer."
Monica	 Y'know, I don't like to brag about it, but I give the best\nmassages!"
Chandler	 All right, then massage me up right nice!'
Chandler	 Ah! Ahh!! Ahh!!'
Monica	 It's so good, isn't it?"
Chandler	 It's so good I don't know what I've done to deserve it!"
Monica	 Say good-bye to sore muscles!'
Chandler	 Good-bye muscles!!'

Chandler	 I'm telling you, she gives the worst massages ever!! Okay, it was like\nshe was torturing me for information. And I wanted to give it up I just\xc2\x97I didn't know\nwhat it was!"
Joey	 Chandler, if it really hurts that bad you should just tell her.'
Chandler	 Look, for the first time in my life I'm in a real relationship. Okay,\nI'm not gonna screw that up by y'know, telling the truth."
Ross	 (walking up with Rachel and carrying coffee) Hey.'
Joey	 Whoa, dude, look out! You almost crushed my hat! (He picks a hat up from\nthe floor. It's one of those magician stovepipe hats.)"
Ross	 Sorry.'
Chandler	 (examining the hat) And the bunny got away. (Turns and starts looking\nfor the bunny as Joey puts the hat on.)'
Ross	 (glaring at Joey) This would be the place where you explain the hat.'
Joey	 Oh! Yeah, look there's this play all right? And I'm up for the part of\nthis real cool like suave international guy. A real clothes horse. So I figure that\neveryone at the audition is gonna be wearing this kinda y'know, ultra-hip, high fashion\nstuff."
Chandler	 And you're gonna make them all disappear."
Joey	 Yeah, like you could find something as sophisticated as this.'
Chandler	 Done.'
Rachel	 Joey, if you wanna look good, why don't you just come down to the store?\nI'll help you out."
Joey	 Great! Thanks, Rach!'
Rachel	 Sure! (Pause) God, please take those off!'
Joey	 All right. '
Ross	 Hey Pheebs, how's it going?"
Chandler	 Hey.'
Phoebe	 Hey! Umm, well, only okay because I just got back from, from the\nhospital.'
Rachel	 What?'
Ross	 Is everything okay?'
Joey	 Are you all right?'
Phoebe	 Oh yeah, no-no-no. I'm fine. I'm okay, but umm, my Grandma sorta died."
Joey	 Pheebs! Sorry!'
Phoebe	 It's okay, I mean she had a really incredible life. And it's not like\nI'm never gonna see her again, y'know she's gonna visit."
Rachel	 Well maybe, maybe she's with us right now?"
Phoebe	 Yeah, her first day on a new spiritual plane and she's gonna come to the\ncoffeehouse!"
Monica	 (entering, in a hurry) Guys! Guys! I just saw two people having sex in a\ncar right outside.'
Ross	 Uhh, Pheebs' Grandmother just died."
Monica	 Ohh my God, I'm so sorry."
Phoebe	 It's okay. Actually y'know what, it's kinda cool. 'Cause it's like\ny'know, one life ends and another begins."
Monica	 (to the guys) Not the way they're doing it. What, what happened? How did\nshe die?"
Phoebe	 Well umm, okay we were in the market and she bent down to get some\nyogurt and she just never came back up again.'
Joey	 Pheebs, I'm so sorry."
Phoebe	 It was really sweet. The last thing she said to me was; "Okay dear,\nyou go get the eggs and I\'m gonna get the yogurt and we\'ll meet at the checkout\ncounter." And y\'know what? We will meet at the checkout counter.'
Rachel	 Okay now Joey, y'know that since you're returning all of this stuff\nright after the audition you're gonna have to wear underwear?"
Joey	 All right, then you'd better show me some of that too then."
Rachel	 Okay, it's missing something. Ooh, I know! Umm, okay. (Goes and grabs a\nbag, that looks like a purse, and shows it to Joey.)"
Joey	 Really? A purse?'
Rachel	 It's not a purse! It's a shoulder bag."
Joey	 It looks like a women's purse."
Rachel	 No Joey, look. Trust me, all the men are wearing them in the spring\ncatalog. Look. (Shows him.) See look, men, carrying the bag.'
Joey	 See look, women, carrying the bag. (He puts it on his shoulder and\nlooks at himself in the mirror and likes what he sees.) But it is odd how a women's purse\nlooks good on me, a man."
Rachel	 Exactly! Unisex!'
Joey	 Maybe you need sex. I had sex a couple days ago.'
Rachel	 No! No Joey! U-N-I-sex.'
Joey	 Well, I ain't gonna say no to that."
Phoebe	 It's Phoebe."
Phoebe	 Umm, well I sorta have some bad news, can I come in?'
Phoebe	 Umm, well, umm Grandma died.'
Phoebe	 No, she just died today! Okay, umm, we're having a memorial service\ntomorrow."
Phoebe	 No you didn't!"
Phoebe	 Well, lots of people! Look, are you coming to memorial service or not?'
Phoebe	 Fine. Okay, enjoy your concert. (Starts to leave.)'
Joey	 Hey!'
Chandler	 Hey!'
Chandler	 Wow! You look just like your son Mrs. Tribbiani!'
Joey	 What? Are you referring to my man's bag? At first, I thought it just\nlooked good, but it's practical too. Check it out! It's got compartments for all your\nstuff! Your wallet! Your keys! Your address book!"
Ross	 Your make-up!'
Rachel	 (entering) Joey, what are you doing with the bag? You're audition is not\nuntil tomorrow."
Joey	 Yeah, but sandwich time is right now. (Removes a sandwich and starts\neating.)'
Rachel	 Joey, y'know you get any mustard on that bag, you can't return it."
Joey	 Why would I return it? I love this bag!'
Rachel	 All right, then you owe me $350.'
Joey	 Fine! Do you take Vasa or Mustercard? (He's holding the fake credit cards\nthat come with the bag.)"
Rachel	 (glaring at him) Joey\xc2\x85'
Joey	 All right relax, look I'll pay you with the money from the acting job I am\ndefinitely gonna get thanks to you."
Ross	 What's the part, Anti-man?"
Rachel	 Hey, don't listen to them. I think it's sexy."
Joey	 U-N-I-sexy? (Smiles provocatively.) '
Phoebe	 Well hello, Mrs. Penella! Thank you so much for coming! Well, okay look,\nhere's your umm, 3-D glasses and Reverend Pong will tell you when to put them on."
Rachel	 Hi sweetie!'
Ross	 Hey, how are you holding up?'
Joey	 Hey Pheebs, I'm so sorry."
Phoebe	 (notices his bag.) Hey, y'know what? My Grandma had the exact same bag!"
Joey	 Here, I brought you some flowers. (He pulls them out of the bag.)'
Phoebe	 Thanks!'
Chandler	 Pulling flowers out it makes the bag look a lot more masculine.'
Phoebe	 Yeah, welcome.'
Phoebe	 Umm here's your 3-D glasses."
Phoebe	 So how did you know Francis?'
Phoebe	 Really?! What's your name?"
Frank Sr.	 (Seeing the look on her face) Y'know what? Strike that. My name uh,\nactually is-is Joe. Uh, Joe umm, Hill."
Phoebe	 You're Frank Buffay?"
Frank Sr.	 Shh! (Whispers) No! Joe Hill!'
Phoebe	 You just said\xc2\x85'
Frank Sr.	 Y'know what, I gotta go. And thank you so much for coming.\n(Hands back his glasses and hurries out.)"
Phoebe	 But\xc2\x85'
Phoebe	 Oh my God!'
Monica	 What?! What honey?'
Ross	 What happened?'
Phoebe	 That was my dad!'
Chandler	 Oh my God!'
Joey	 (approaches, wearing his glasses) Hey you guys, check it out. Check it\nout. (Moves his hand towards and away from his face.) It's like it's coming right at me.\n(Chandler helps out a little bit by pushing on Joey's arm, which causes his hand to slap\nhim in his face.)"

Monica	 Oh, did you catch him?!'
Phoebe	 Uh-huh.'
Ross	 Wh-what did he say?!'
Phoebe	 He said, "Nice to meet you Glenda." (They stare at her,\ndumbfounded) Well, obviously I couldn\'t give him my real name?'
Rachel	 Why?! Why not?!'
Phoebe	 Come on, you saw the way he ran out of here! What do you think? He's\ngonna stick around and talk to the daughter he abandoned!"
Joey	 What did you say to him?'
Phoebe	 Well, I said, I told him y'know, that I was the executor person of\nFrancis' will and that I needed to talk to him so I'm gonna meet him at the coffee house\nlater."
Phoebe	 All right, well, I just can't think about that right now. I just wanna\nsay good-bye to my Grandma."
Rachel	 Okay.'
Monica	 All right, let's go say good-bye."
Joey	 (entering, with bag) Hey! I'm off to my audition. How do I look?"
Rachel	 Ahhh, I think you look great! That bag is gonna get you that\npart.'
Chandler	 And a date with a man!'
Joey	 Y'know what? Make fun all you want. This is a great bag! Okay? And\nit's as handy as it is becoming. Now, just because you don't understand something, doesn't\nmake it wrong. All right? So from now on you guys are gonna have to get used to the fact\nthat Joey, (pats the bag) comes with a bag! (Exits.)"
Phoebe	 All right, I'd better go too. I have to go talk to my dad."
Rachel	 Ooh, Pheebs, what are you gonna say? Are you gonna tell him who you are?'
Phoebe	 Umm, no, not at first 'cause I-I don't want to freak him out"
Ross	 Well, but aren\'t you pissed at him?! I mean this guy abandoned you!\nI gotta tell you if this were me, this guy would be in some serious physical danger!\n(Getting worked up) I mean I-I-I\'d walk in there and I\'d be like, "Yo, dad! You and\nme outside right now!" (Calming down.) I kinda scared myself.'
Monica	 Well, at least you scared someone.'
Phoebe	 Y'know it's funny, you'd think I'd be angry. I mean, you'd think\nI'd wanna rip his tiny little head off. Fortunately, I'm past it."
Monica	 Phoebe, you do seem a little tense. Here, let me help you. '
Phoebe	 All right.'
Phoebe	 Oh! Get off!! Ow!! Oh, stop it!! Why?! Why are you doing that to me?!'
Monica	 What are you talking about?'
Phoebe	 As a masseuse and a human, I'm begging you, never do that to anyone!"
Monica	 (indignant) I give good massages! (Ross laughs.) I used to give them to\nRachel all the time before she got allergic! And-and-and Chandler loves them! Watch! (She\nstarts giving Chandler a massage.)'
Phoebe	 (seeing the look on Chandler's face) He-he does not like it! He hates\nit! He's in pain!"
Monica	 No he's not!"
Chandler	 (wincing) Yes, he is!'
Monica	 What?!'
Chandler	 I'm sorry but, ow-owww-owww!"
Monica	 You've been lying to me? I can't believe you'd do that."
Ross	 Well, maybe he just didn't want to hurt your feelings."
Monica	 But the minute we start to lie to each other\xc2\x85 (Pauses after she\nrealizes what she's saying.) And by 'we' I mean society."
The Casting Director	 Any time you're ready, Joey."
Joey	 (reading from the script) Well, you must be new here. Why don't we get a\ntable and I'll buy you a drink."
The Casting Director	 (stopping him) I'm sorry. Could you, could you try it\nwithout the purse?"
Joey	 Yeah, sure. (He takes it off and starts reading.) Well, you must be new\nhere. Maybe we should\xc2\x97I'm sorry, can I ask you something? (He stops and asks a\nquestion.)"
The Casting Director	 Sure. What?'
Joey	 Well, first it's not a purse."
The Casting Director	 Okay, anytime.'
Joey	 I mean if-if you're thinking it's a woman's bag, it's not. It's a man's\nbag!"
The Casting Director	 Okayyyy! Anddd, go!'
Joey	 All right look, let me show you the catalog! (Does so.) See? Huh? It's the\nlatest thing! Everyone's got one! Men! Women! Children! Everyone's carrying them!"
The Casting Director	 Umm, do you sell these bags?'
Joey	 Noooo. No-no-no, these babies sell themselves.'
The Casting Director	 Okay! Thank you! That was great!'
Joey	 Yeah but I didn\xc2\x92t read anything.'
The Casting Director	 I think we've seen enough!"
Joey	 Okay! All right, I'll see ya. (As he's walking off stage.) (Patting the\nbag.) We got it! We got it!"
Chandler	 Hey, is Rachel here?'
Monica	 No.'
Chandler	 (coming all the way in) Listen, I just wanted to apologize about this\nafternoon and the whole massage thing. Y'know? I-I really like 'em."
Monica	 Oh, please, stop! Look, we\'re supposed to be honest with each other. I-I\njust wish you could tell me\xc2\x97just say, "I don\'t like your massages."'
Chandler	 (falling into that trap) I don't like your massages."
Monica	 (starting to cry) See? It's no big deal."
Chandler	 Okay, but now see you're crying!"
Monica	 I'm not crying about that! I'm crying about something that happened at\nwork."
Chandler	 What?'
Monica	 (bursting into tears) My boyfriend said he didn't like my massages."
Chandler	 It's okay, you don't have to be the best at everything."
Monica	 Oh my God! You don't know me at all!"
Chandler	 Okay, you give the worst massages in the world.'
Monica	 I'm crying here!!"
Chandler	 Okay, hear me out. Okay? You give the best bad massages. If\nanybody was looking for the best bad massage and they were thinking to themselves,\n"Who\'s the best of that?" They\'d have to go to you.'
Monica	 Huh. So you're saying like umm, if there was an award for the best bad\nmassage, well who would get that?"
Chandler	 Oh, it would be you! You! Monica! And you'd get all the votes!"
Monica	 So maybe they could umm, call the award the Monica?'
Chandler	 Absolutely!'
Monica	 Okay. I suck!'
Chandler	 Yeah! (They hug.)'
Phoebe	 Umm, thank you for meeting with me.'
Frank Sr.	 Thank you. All right.'
Phoebe	 Come, sit. (He's hesitant.) Sit. (Still hesitating.) Sit! (He sits on\nthe arm of the couch.) Umm, all righty, before we get started I just\xc2\x97I need you to\nstate for the official record that you are in fact Frank Buffay."
Frank Sr.	 Oh yes. Yes, yes, I am, uh-hmm.'
Phoebe	 Okay.'
Frank Sr.	 So, what did Francis leave me?'
Phoebe	 Huh?'
Frank Sr.	 Well, that's why you wanted me to come, right?"
Phoebe	 Oh yes. Yes. Yeah\xc2\x97no. She did. She left you umm, (looking in her\npurse) this lipstick.'
Frank Sr.	 Oh. Huh. It's huh, well it's (opens it) oh it's\xc2\x97ew used. Umm,\ncool."
Phoebe	 Okay. I have just a few questions to ask so I'm going to get out my\nofficial forms. (She picks up a couple of crumpled receipts.) Okay, so, question 1) You\nand uh, you were married to Francis' daughter Lilly, is that correct?"
Frank Sr.	 Yes, yes I was.'
Phoebe	 Okay, umm, question 2) Umm, did that marriage end A. Happily, B. Medium,\nor C. In the total abandonment of her and her two children?'
Frank Sr.	 It really says that?!'
Phoebe	 Yeah. See? (Quickly shows him.)'
Frank Sr.	 Well then I guess then I-I would I would have to say C.'
Phoebe	 Hmm, okay, total abandonment. Okay, reasons for abandonment, A.\nTop secret government work, B. Amnesia, or C. Or you're just a selfish, irresponsible bad,\nbad man?"
Frank Sr.	 Y'know, I don't think I want the lipstick that much. (Gets up to\nleave.) But umm\xc2\x85 Oh, would you do me a favor? And umm, would you, would you give\nLilly that, please? (Hands her a note.)"
Phoebe	 What?!'
Frank Sr.	 Well Lilly, when you see Lilly would you give her that, that note?\nBecause I wanted to talk to her at the memorial but, well I pictured her getting mad at me\nthe way you got mad at me and I well, I chickened out. So, uh, I wrote her that note,\nwould you give it to her please?'
Phoebe	 But you-you-you came to see Lilly?'
Frank Sr.	 Yeah, yeah. Why?'
Phoebe	 Lilly's dead. (He looks up in shock.)"
Frank Sr.	 She what?!'
Phoebe	 She's dead."
Frank Sr.	 Are you sure?'
Phoebe	 Well, if she isn't then cremating her was a big mistake."
Frank Sr.	 I can't believe this. I just\xc2\x97I can't believe this.\nHow-how\xc2\x97Oh my God. How long ago?"
Phoebe	 17 years ago.'
Frank Sr.	 Oh! What about, what about the girls?'
Phoebe	 Well, Ursula is a waitress and-and she lives in Soho. And Phoebe,\n(pause) is on this couch.'
Phoebe	 Yep, lipstick and a daughter, big day for you!'
Frank Sr.	 Phoebe, I-I-I-umm, (Sits down next to her and brushes against her\nleg.) Oops. (He backs up.) I just, I-I-I-I don\xc2\x92t, I don\xc2\x92t know what to say. I\njust can't believe that you're my daughter, you're so pretty."
Phoebe	 Yes. Well, that's neither here nor there."
Frank Sr.	 So would it, would it make you feel better if I said I was very, very\nsorry that I left?'
Phoebe	 Y'know what, it doesn\xc2\x92t matter what you say it's not gonna make a\ndifference anyway, so you can just go."
Frank Sr.	 All right. Well, y'know in my defense I was a lousy father."
Phoebe	 That's a defense?"
Frank Sr.	 Yes. Yes it is. I burned the formula and I put your diapers on\nbackwards. I mean, I made up a song to sing you to sleep, but that made you cry even more!'
Phoebe	 You make up songs?'
Frank Sr.	 Well no, just-just that one. But, it was stupid. Let's see, how did\nit, how did it go. Umm. (Singing.) "
Frank Sr.	 I just, I y'know, I'm not very good at this. So, umm\xc2\x85 (Backs\naway.)"
Phoebe	 Well, I am. (Moves over and takes his hand.)'
Phoebe	 Not yet, no. (Drops his hand and moves back.)'

Joey	 (dejected) Hi.'
All	 Hey!'
Chandler	 Hey man, how did the audition go?'
Joey	 Estelle said I didn't get it. (Sits down next to Rachel on the couch.)"
Rachel	 What?! Why? Joey you were so ready for it!'
Joey	 Yeah, I thought so too but, she said the casting people had some problems\nwith me.'
Ross	 What kind of problem?'
Joey	 Well to tell you the truth, they uh, (Pause) they had a problem with the\nbag!'
Chandler	 Oh my God!'
Ross	 Nooooo!'
Joey	 Y'know what? It was a stupid play anyway!"
Monica	 Y'know, Joey, I think it's time to give up the bag."
Joey	 I don't wanna give up the bag. I don't have to give up the bag! Do I Rach?\n(She's avoiding his eyes.) Oh, you think I should give up the bag!"
Rachel	 Honey wait, Joey, I\xc2\x92m sorry I mean as terrific as I think you are\nwith it\xc2\x85 (Looks for help.)'
Chandler	 Oh, hey! (Ross nods in agreement as well.)'
Rachel	 \xc2\x85I just don't know if the world is ready for you and your bag."
Joey	 I can't believe I'm hearing this!"
Rachel	 Wait a minute! Wait a minute! I'm not saying that you shouldn\xc2\x92t\nhave a bag, I just\xc2\x97it's just there are other bags that are a little less umm, (Pause)\ncontroversial."
Chandler	 Yeah umm, they're called wallets."
