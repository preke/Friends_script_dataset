Rachel	 Hi!'
Ross	 Hey! So what's the big news you had us rush all the\n  way over here for?"
Chandler	 Okay, our news. My company has asked me to head\n  up our office in Tulsa , so as of Monday I'm being officially relocated."
Ross	 Oh my God!'
Phoebe	 What?!'
Rachel	 What?!'
Ross	 Monday?!'
Joey	 How long do you have to go for?'
Chandler	 They said it could be up to a year.'
Joey	 A year?!'
Rachel	 (To Monica) Do you have to go?'
Monica	 I kind of have to don't I? Because of this stupid\n  thing (Points to her wedding ring.)"
Chandler	 There is nothing like the support of your loving\n  wife, huh?'
Joey	 Wait a minute, you can't go to Tulsa. Maybe you forgot,\n  but we've got tickets to the Jets game next week."
Chandler	 I'm sorry buddy, but I don't think I'm gonna be\n  able to make it."
Joey	 We were gonna go see the Jets!'
Ross	 You can't go, I mean you're the glue that holds this\n  group together!"
Chandler	 Really?'
Ross	 Not you.'
Joey	 I can't believe you guys are moving."
Phoebe	 I call their apartment!!!'
Everyone	 No!!! Ah!! Ahh!!! '

Joey	 Here you are (Hands Rachel a cup of coffee)'
Rachel	 Thank you Joey. You know what? I'm not even sure\n  I can have caffeine."
Ross	 I went thru this with Ben and Carol. One cup of coffee\n  won't affect your milk."
Rachel	 Yeah. Just to be sure I'm gonna call Dr. Wiener. "
Joey	 (Laughs)'
Rachel	 Every time? (She takes up her cell phone and starts\n  dialing.)'
Joey	 Uhuh.'
Ross	 Rach, you don't have to call whenever you have a little\n  question, okay? Trust me, I know this."
Rachel	 All right, I trust you. (Continues to dial)'
Ross	 Rachel, I can see you dialing! I don't understand why..."
Rachel	 I'm on the phone! (On the phone) Dr. Wiener? (Ross\n  and Rachel walk away)"
Joey	 (Laughs)'
Phoebe	 It's so weird seeing Ross and Rachel with a baby.\n  It's just so grown up."
Joey	 I know, yeah. I feel like we're all growing up. Person\n  named Wiener, God that kills me. (Laughs)"
Phoebe	 Look at you all grown up.'
Joey	 Actually, you know what? I am. That whole thing with\n  Rachel made me realize that maybe I'm ready for a more serious relationship.\n  You know? Like I'd like to meet a nice mature commitment-minded lady. And looks\n  aren't as important as...Nah, she's gotta be hot."
Phoebe	 You know, I might know somebody. Hey, how about you\n  set me up with someone, and we double date!'
Joey	 I can do that, yeah. How is Friday?'
Phoebe	 Done. Oh good, really?'
Joey	 Yeah! '
Phoebe	 Let's see! (Opens her address book.) Oh, you know\n  who's great? Sandy Poophack. "
Joey	 (Laughs) Poophack... (Laughs)'
Phoebe	 Yeah... All right, well that rules out Lana Titweiller'
Joey	 (Laughs)'
[SCENE	 Chandler and Monica's apartment]"
Chandler	 (Enters) Hey!'
Monica	 Hey!'
Chandler	 I've got good news!"
Monica	 You got out of the whole Tulsa thing?'
Chandler	 Okay, I have news. You don't have to move to Tulsa.\n  You can stay here and keep your job. "
Monica	 It's great! How?"

Monica	 So you're gonna be gone four days a week? (Thinks\n  about it.) No."
Chandler	 I'm sorry, are you just used to saying that?"
Monica	 No. I can't be away from you for that long."
Chandler	 Really?'
Monica	 Yeah, you're my husband. I'm not gonna live in a\n  different state than you for 208 days out of the year."
Chandler	 That's fast math! We could use you in Tulsa. "
Monica	 Honey, thanks for trying to figure out a way, but\n  if you're going to Tulsa, I wanna go with you."
Chandler	 Hey, you said that without gagging!'
Monica	 I know! (They high-five.) '
Rachel	 (On the phone) Excuse me? Oh yeah? Well, up yours\ntoo! (Hangs up)'
Ross	 (Enters from his bedroom)Who the hell was that?!'
Rachel	 Dr. Wiener. '
Ross	 Rach, you can't call people at three in the morning. "
Rachel	 Oh you know what, you sound just like his wife!'
Ross	 Was there anything you did wrong with Emma?'
Rachel	 Yes, of course there is! Okay? I'm not insane!"
Ross	 Well, what was it?'
Rachel	 Hiccups.'
Ross	 Rach, I told you, you can't call him every time any\n  little thing comes up. "
Rachel	 Yeah well, not anymore I can't. He fired us! What\n  are we gonna do? We have to find a pediatrician. Wait wait, Monica said that\n  when you guys were growing up, you really liked your doctor. What was his name?"
Ross	 Dr. Gettleman? Yeah I know, I don't think that's a\n  good idea. In fact, I think he's dead."
Rachel	 Argh! Why does everything happen to me?!'
Ross	 Rach, I promise first thing tomorrow we'll find another\n  doctor, but I gotta get up early and I'm not feeling all that well."
Rachel	 What? What, do you mean you're not feeling well?\n  What do you have? Is it Rubella? Because don't go near Emma, she has not had\n  that shot."
Ross	 You know? Come to think of it, it does feel Rubella-like!\n  (Walks back into his room.)'
Rachel	 (Grabs the phone and stars dialing) (On phone) (In\n  a high pitch voice) Wiener, Wiener (In a low pitch voice) Wiener, Wiener!!!'
Ross	 (Comes back into the living room) Rachel!!!'
Rachel	 Great! Now he's gonna know it was me!"
Phoebe	 (Enters) Hey!'
Joey	 Hey!'
Phoebe	 So how is this for our big double date tonight? (She\n  is all dressed up)'
Joey	 (Realizes that he has forgotten all about the double\n  date) Oh my God!'
Phoebe	 Ooh, great! Just the reaction I was hoping for. '
Joey	 Yeah, so you found someone for me. You didn't forget? "
Phoebe	 Of course not! And you're gonna love Mary Ellen.\n  She's really smart and cute and funny, and I can't tell you how I know this,\n  but she' not opposed to threesomes. So tell me some about my guy. "
Joey	 No.'
Phoebe	 Come on, give me something. What's his name?"
Joey	 Mike.'
Phoebe	 Mike? Okay! What's his last name?"
Joey	 Damnit! Is there no mystery left in romance anymore!?'
Phoebe	 All right, we'll se you and Mike at the restaurant\n  in a couple hours."
Joey and Phoebe	 (Ad-lib good-byes) (Phoebe leaves)'
Joey	 Why did I have to say Mike? I don't know a Mike! Why\n  couldn't I have said... (Looks through his address book) There's no guy in\n  there! "
Rachel	 It's impossible to find a good doctor. I mean, how\n  do you know the good ones from the ones who are gonna push their penis against\n  your knee?"
Monica	 Excuse me?'
Chandler	 I know what she's talking about."
Rachel	 We've got to find a new pediatrician. Ross was getting\n  sick last night, and I think Emma may have caught it."
Monica	 Why don't you go see Dr. Gettleman? "
Rachel	 Ross said he died. '
Monica	 He didn't die. I saw his daughter last week. Said\n  he was fine. Her on the other hand, botched Botox."
Rachel	 Oh, great! Well, then I'm gonna take Emma to see\n  him. I wonder why Ross said that he died."
Monica	 Oh, maybe he was getting him confused with his childhood\n  therapist.'
Chandler	 He saw a therapist?'
Monica	 Yeah, he used to have this recurring nightmare, just\n  really freaked him out.'
Rachel	 Why? What was it?'
Monica	 That I was going to eat him.'
Joey	 MIKE!!!'
Mike	 Yeah? '
Joey	 (Checks him out) Okay! (Walks over to his table and\n  sits down with him)'
Mike	 I gotta tell you, I can't believe I'm doing this with\n  you. Although I did just get out of a nine-year relationship, so I guess I\n  should be open and taking some risks."
Joey	 Everything is gonna be fine. Just follow my lead, okay?\n  All you have to do is pretend to be Mike.'
Mike	 I am Mike.'
Joey	 Atta boy!'
Joey	 Okay, look...'
Everyone	 (Ad-lib hellos)'
Phoebe	 Joey, this is Mary Ellen Jenkins. So, Mike, how do\n  you and Joey know each other anyway?'
Mike	 How do I and Joey know each other? Wow, if I had a\n  nickel for every time somebody has asked me that.'
Joey	 (Laughs) From school.'
Mike	 Yeah, we met in college. (Off Joey's look) I mean,\n  high school."
Phoebe	 Wow, you guys go way back then. So what are you up\n  to these days?'
Mike	 Well, I'm a lawyer."
Joey	 Mike, 'attorney at law'!"
Mike	 Actually, I just gave up my practice.'
Joey	 What? That's the kinda thing you usually run by me."
Mike	 I always wanted to play piano professionally, and I\n  figured if I don't do this now, I never will."
Phoebe	 Wow, that's great! I liked that better than the law\n  thing, so..."
Joey	 Which is why I waited until now to introduce you to\n  Mike.'
Mary Ellen	 I thought you thought he was still a lawyer.'
Joey	 No, no, that's not what I meant. Let's get you a cocktail."
Monica	 Hey!'
Chandler	 Hey!'
Monica	 What are you doing?'
Chandler	 Looking for restaurant jobs for you in Tulsa.'
Monica	 That's so sweet. Find anything?"
Chandler	 Slim Pickings.'
Monica	 Nothing, huh?'
Chandler	 No, 'Slim Pickings', it's a barbecue restaurant.\n  They're looking for a cook. Actually 'cook' may be a bit of a stretch. They're\n  looking for someone to shovel mesquite. "
Monica	 'Slim Pickings'...That is so cheesy."
Chandler	 'So Cheesy' also has an opening."
Monica	 Honey, that's okay. I actually know this woman, Nancy,\n  who's a restaurant biz head-hunter. Maybe she'll know of something."
Chandler	 Can I just say how much I appreciate you coming\n  with me. When we get to Tulsa I'm taking you for a great dinner at 'Slim Pickings'.\n  'So Cheesy'? 'Whole Hog'? It's going to be tough to keep Kosher in Tulsa."
Monica	 (On phone) Hi, Nancy. Hi, it's Monica Geller. I'm\n  good. Listen, I'm looking for a job in Tulsa. Well yeah, my husband has been\n  relocated...Because I love him! No, I don't want a job in New York. Javo (sp?)\n  is looking? Oh my God! He asked for me personally? Oh my God! Oh, wow, this\n  is really flattering, but I'm moving to Tulsa. Yeah, so if you would tell Javo\n  (sp?) 'I'll take it!'"
Rachel	 Hi, my name is Rachel Green, I have an appointment\n  for Emma.'
Receptionist	 Dr. Gettleman is finishing up with a patient,\n  he should be out shortly.'
Dr. Gettleman	 (To a patient) I think you just have a cold,\n  it's definitely not Strep."
Ross	 Thanks doctor.'
Dr. Gettleman	 Would you like a lollypop?'
Ross	 You even have to ask?! (He grabs a lollypop out of\n  a jar) (Sees Rachel) (To Rachel) He is alive!'
Phoebe	 You know, it's so surprising that you and Joey have\n  known each other for so long and I've never heard about you."
Joey	 Yeah, that's because we had a bit of a falling out.\n  Mike hit my mom with a car."
Mike	 No, I didn't."
Joey	 That's okay Mike, I have forgiven you. And now we're\n  friends again everything's great!"

Joey	 Please, we're trying to have a conversation. (Pushes\n  the wine glass closer to Mary Ellen.)"
Mary Ellen	 Wow, you're a lot nicer on 'Days of Our Lives'."
Mike	 'Days of Our Lives'! That's why you look so familiar!"
Phoebe	 What?!'
Mike	 What?!'
Joey	 What?!'
Phoebe	 Do you not know each other?'
Joey	 (Laughs) Of course we do! Mike is playing a game that\n  we used to play in high school. Yeah, where we pretend we don't know each other.\n  We played all kinds of games. (To Mike) Hey, remember the one where I punch\n  you in the face for not being cool?!"
Phoebe	 Mike, let me ask you something. How many sisters\n  does Joey have?'
Mike	 (Joey holds up six fingers) Six!'
Joey	 What are you doing? I said seven! (Holds up six fingers.)\n  (Realizes his mistake) Argh!!!'
Phoebe	 Joey, why did you set me up with a stranger?'
Joey	 Because I forgot about our date, I'm so sorry."
Mike	 I'm sorry too. And just to be clear, I didn't hit his\n  mother with a car."
Phoebe	 (To Joey) You are unbelievable! I spent so much time\n  finding the perfect girl for you, you know. Mary Ellen is really smart and\n  cute and loose.'
Mary Ellen	 Hey!'
Phoebe	 Who are you kidding? (To Joey) You just find some\n  guy off the street for me? Oh God! This is humiliating!'
Joey	 Look Phoebe I'm so sorry! Hey, look, if you don't like\n  this guy I can find you a better one. (Looks around) Mike!! Mike!!"
Phoebe	 I'm out of here (She leaves)"
Mike	 It was nice meeting you!'
Joey	 (To Mary Ellen) You're leaving too?"
Mary Ellen	 I'll stay if you can tell me my name."
Joey	 Good night! '
Chandler	 Honey, we're leaving tomorrow you've still got\n  a lot of packing to do."
Monica	 You're right. (Pause) Maybe I shouldn't go."
Chandler	 What?'
Monica	 So Nancy told me about this job at this great restaurant,\n  Javo (sp?). It's just a little outside of Tulsa."
Chandler	 How far outside?'
Monica	 Manhattan.'
Chandler	 And you're thinking of taking it? (Pause) So before\n  you said being me with me was more important than any job, but I guess now\n  it's old job, (Raises his hand) me, (Raises his hand) new job. "
Monica	 I'm gonna miss this hand! Okay I know it's a lot\n  to ask, but oh my God Chandler, this is a once in a lifetime opportunity."
Chandler	 What happened to 'you can't live without me four\n  days a week'?"
Monica	 Well, if you really think about it, I mean four days\n  is not that long. I mean, I see you Monday before you go to work, and I see\n  you Thursday when you get back, and I always work late on Tuesdays, so really\n  if you think about it, it's really just one day. And well, if we can't make\n  it one day, we've got real problems my friend."
Chandler	 I think you should take the job.'
Monica	 Really?'
Chandler	 Yeah. I know it must be important to you when you\n  start chattering like a monkey.'
Monica	 That's the nicest anyone has ever said to me!"
Ross	 Hey!'
Monica	 How was the pediatrician?'
Rachel	 Oh, I really liked him. (Looks at Ross) Yeah, it\n  was really, really, really good.'
Ross	 You promised you wouldn't say anything."
Rachel	 I know. (Pause) Ross still sees his pediatrician!!!\n  (To Ross) I don't care!"
Monica	 Are you serious? You still see Dr. Gettleman?'
Ross	 He's a brilliant diagnostician!"
Chandler	 Diagnostician or boo-boo fixer?'
Rachel	 Ross, seriously! You've gotta go to an appropriate\n  doctor."
Ross	 Why? Why? I know it's a little weird, but hey, he's\n  a great doctor, okay? He knows my medical history, and every time I go in there,\n  he makes a big deal. 'Ah look, it's my favorite patient!'"
Chandler	 Does he say that before he sticks his thermometer\n  in your touchy?'
Ross	 Hey, I seem to remember someone bringing his security\n  blanket to college!'
Chandler	 That was not a security blanket! That was a wall-hanging!'
Ross	 It didn't spend much time on the wall!!!"
Mike	 Excuse me, hi. I was hoping I would run into you. Can\n  we talk?'
Phoebe	 Sure.'
Mike	 I'm sorry, really, I'm so embarrassed. Really, I'm\n  a pretty nice guy. Just ask my parole officer...Apparently I'm not a funny\n  guy."
Phoebe	 Why did you go along with that?'
Mike	 Because I was told I'd get a free dinner, which I didn't.\n  And that I'd meet a pretty girl. Which I did."
Phoebe	 That's true. (Pause) Well, is anything you told me\n  about yourself true?"
Mike	 My name in Mike, and I do play piano.'
Phoebe	 Prove it.'
Mike	 There isn't a piano here."
Phoebe	 That wouldn't stand in the way of a true pianist."
Mike	 (Plays 'air piano')"
Phoebe	 You are really good! I play a little guitar myself.'
Mike	 Really?'
Phoebe	 Uhuh.'
Mike	 That's great. What kind of music do you play?"
Phoebe	 Well, like acoustic folksy stuff. You know? But right\n  now I'm working on a couple 'Iron Maiden' covers. "
Mike	 Do you think that maybe, sometime, I could...'
Phoebe	 It's okay. Go ahead, ask me out."
Mike	 Okay. Do you think maybe sometime I could take you\n  out?'
Joey	 (Walks In)'
Phoebe	 (To Mike) Oh, you just caught me off guard! Yeah,\n  that would be nice.'
Joey	 Look at this. My two best friends!'
Ross	 Excuse me, I don't mean to be a jerk, but the baby\n  with the rash came in after me."
Receptionist	 The doctor will be right with you sir.'
Girl	 (Reading a book) Mommy, I can't find Waldo."
Ross	 With the circus? He's behind the elephant."
Woman	 Wow, so your child is a big fan of the Waldo books\n  too?'
Ross	 Yeah, that's how I know. I'm Ross by the way."
Sally	 Hi, I'm Sally. So, no ring. Can I assume you are also\n  a single parent?"
Ross	 I am a single parent.'
Sally	 It's hard isn't it? There's almost no time for a social\n  life. I mean, where are you gonna meet someone?"
Ross	 Well, let's say, I don't know, you met someone in the\n  pediatrician's office."
Nurse	 (To Ross) Rossy, we're ready for you."
Ross	 Hmm, yeah. (To a random boy in the waiting room) Come\n  on Ross jr. It's time to go in."
Boy	 Mommy (He walks over to Sally.)'
Girl	 Mommy, what's wrong with that man?"
Ross	 Hey, I helped you find Waldo! '
Ross	 (Enters) Oh good, you haven't left yet."
Monica	 Where have you been?'
Ross	 I got held up at Dr. Gettleman's office. There was\n  some guy that freaked everybody out."
Chandler	 Well, you got here just in time. I really have\n  to go buddy. (They hug)'
Ross	 Oh man.'
Monica	 Promise to call me when you land.'
Chandler	 Of course I will call you. I love you.'
Monica	 I love you too. (They kiss)'
Rachel	 Okay, wow, wow, wow. Watch the tongue people, we've\n  got a baby over here."
Phoebe	 Bye Chandler.'
Chandler	 Awww. (They hug) Bye!'
Rachel	 Bye honey. (They hug)'
Chandler	 (Tries to hug Joey but J. moves away) What's the\n  matter Joe?"
Joey	 I'm mad at you for leaving! You're nothing but a big\n  leaver. Big leaver with a stupid suitcase."
Chandler	 Any chance you are trying to pick a fight to make\n  all this easier?'
Joey	 Dude, you see right thru me!! (They hug) (Joey heads\n  for the door and pushes Chandler's suitcase on the way out.)"
Chandler	 Well, bye Mon, bye Ross, Rachel, bye Emma!'
Phoebe	 Okay, bye-bye! (Pushes Chandler out the door.) Good\n  trip! (Slams the door)'
Monica	 (Runs out to the hallway) Chandler, wait. It goes
Chandler	 I know.'
Monica	 I love you so much.'
Chandler	 I know that too. (They kiss)'
Chandler	 (On cell phone) Don't worry, I'll be back before\n  you know it. Yes it will be the same. Because I know, that's how. I promise."
Joey	 (On the phone with Chandler) Double promise? Call me\n  when you land.'
Monica	 Can I talk now?'
Joey	 Okay, bye. (He hangs up the phone.)'
Monica	 Joey?'
Joey	 He had to board. '
