Joey	 I\xc2\x92m an actor, y\xc2\x92know? As-as a group, we tend to be over\ndramatic.'
Ross	 Rachel who\xc2\x92s carrying my baby? Rachel?'
Joey	 Look no, I-I know it\xc2\x92s bad, and I know it\xc2\x92s wrong. Okay? But-but\nit\xc2\x92s not like anything\xc2\x92s ever gonna happen. Y\xc2\x92know? These-these are just\nfeelings, they\xc2\x92re gonna go away.'

Gunther	 Rachel?!!'

Rachel	 Oh-oh! Okay, she\xc2\x92s kicking!'
Chandler	 Oh! (Puts his hand on her belly.) She\xc2\x92s growing inside you.'
Rachel	 Whoa!!'
Chandler	 Oh! (Pulls his hand away.)'
Rachel	 Wow that was a big one.'
Chandler	 I think that\xc2\x92s the youngest girl ever to reject me.'
Phoebe	 (entering) Oh hey you guys!'
Chandler	 Oh hey!'
Rachel	 Hi!'
Phoebe	 Hey listen let me ask you, do you believe in soul mates?'
Rachel	 Oh yes I do. I do. I believe that there is one perfect person out there\nfor everyone. And do you know how you find him? You stop looking for him. That\xc2\x92s why\nI stopped looking for Russell Crowe. He\xc2\x92ll find me.'
Phoebe	 Uh-huh, (To Chandler) and you?'
Chandler	 No. I mean I believe that uh, certain people are more suited for each\nother and I believe in falling in love, but soul mates, I don\xc2\x92t think they exist.'
Phoebe	 Okay, good.'
Chandler	 Why?'
Phoebe	 Well last night, I met Monica\xc2\x92s.'
Chandler	 What?'
Phoebe	 Yeah, I had a date with this guy, and I swear to God, he is her other\nhalf.'
Chandler	 Come on, don\xc2\x92t be crazy. (To Rachel) You don\xc2\x92t think\nthere\xc2\x92s someone out there better suited for Monica than me, do ya? (Rachel looks at\nhim.)'
Rachel	 (To Phoebe) Well, what\xc2\x92s he like?!'
Phoebe	 Well he\xc2\x92s tall.'
Rachel	 Uh-huh.'
Phoebe	 He has brown hair.'
Rachel	 Of course, of course.'
Chandler	 A tall guy with hair similar to mine, oh unknowable universe!'
Phoebe	 He works with food!'
Rachel	 Oh sure. Older?'
Phoebe	 Obviously, and he\xc2\x92s British.'
Rachel	 Oh, I was just gonna ask!'
Phoebe	 Yeah? And, he\xc2\x92s-he\xc2\x92s so centered and mature and confident.'
Rachel	 Oh, it\xc2\x92s so sad they never had a chance to meet.'
Chandler	 Luckily, the guy she settled for can\xc2\x92t hear what you\xc2\x92re\ntalking about.'
Phoebe	 Oh, I\xc2\x92m so sorry. Um, and maybe I\xc2\x92m wrong! I\nbut\xc2\x97y\xc2\x92know I\xc2\x92m gonna go out with him again, I\xc2\x92ll find out more.'
Chandler	 You believe that this guy is destined for someone else and you\xc2\x92re\nstill gonna date him?'
Phoebe	 Well, he may not be my soul mate, but a girl\xc2\x92s gotta eat.'
Monica	 Hey.'
Ross	 Hey.'
Monica	 I just talked to Joey, I just\xc2\x97I want to see how you were.'
Ross	 Oh y\xc2\x92know, I still\xc2\x97I can\xc2\x92t believe it. Joey and Rachel I\nmean it\xc2\x92s\xc2\x85 It\xc2\x92s like you and me going out, only weirder!'
Monica	 All right, I know you\xc2\x92re hurting, and-and I want to be supportive,\nbut don\xc2\x92t say that again.'
Ross	 Oh my God! What if, what if they get married? Then he\xc2\x92d be the\nstepfather of my child.'
Monica	 Honey, I don\xc2\x92t think that\xc2\x92s something we need to worry about!\nFirst of all he\xc2\x92s-he\xc2\x92s never gonna tell her how he feels about her. And even if\nhe did you have no idea how she\xc2\x92d react.'
Ross	 Sure, because women never like Joey. Y\xc2\x92know, I think he\xc2\x92s a\nvirgin.'
Monica	 Joey\xc2\x85he\xc2\x92s not even thinking about going after Rachel!'
Ross	 He\xc2\x92s not?'
Monica	 No! All he\xc2\x92s thinking about is how you\xc2\x92re taking this! I mean,\nlisten it\xc2\x92s totally freaking him out. He\xc2\x92s talking about moving to Vermont.'
Ross	 Why?'
Monica	 He says he wants to leave the country. (Pause) He thinks you hate him.'
Ross	 Hate him? I\xc2\x85 No, I don\xc2\x92t hate him. (Pause) It\xc2\x92s just\nit\xc2\x92s Rachel, y\xc2\x92know?'
Monica	 Honey I can\xc2\x92t even imagine how hard this must be for you. But, I\ndon\xc2\x92t want you to lose Joey over it. And right now he just needs to know that\nyou\xc2\x92re still his friend.'
Ross	 Okay. Okay, I\xc2\x92ll talk to him.'
Monica	 All right. Now do it soon, he just asked me how to convert his dollars\ninto Vermont money.'
Phoebe	 Oh! Hi!'
Monica	 Hi!'
Phoebe	 Umm, Chandler, Monica, this is Don.'
Don	 Oh, hello. (Shakes Chandler\xc2\x92s hand.) Hello. (Shakes Monica\xc2\x92s\nhand.)'
Phoebe	 (mouths to Chandler) Soul mate.'
Chandler	 (mouths to Phoebe) What?'
Phoebe	 (cough talks) Soul mate.'
Monica	 So, what have you guys been doing?'
Don	 Well, we just had a terrible lunch today at Reattica. What is with all the\nsun-dried tomatoes at that place?'
Monica	 I know! What is this, 1985?!'
Don	 That\xc2\x92s exactly what I said. Phoebe, isn\xc2\x92t that strange.'
Monica	 Not really.'
Chandler	 What\xc2\x92s wrong with sun-dried tomatoes? (Everyone stares at him.)\nOn a barbecue chicken pizza? (Still there\xc2\x92s staring.) No?'
Monica	 So Don, what-what other restaurants do you like?'
Don	 Well, Octavio, 27&7\xc2\x97Oh! And there\xc2\x92s this great little place,\nAlessandro\xc2\x92s.'
Monica	 Oh my God! That\xc2\x92s my restaurant, I\xc2\x92m the chef there.'
Don	 You\xc2\x92re kidding me!'
Monica	 No!'
Don	 Your food is fantastic! Wow, I really want to talk to you about your menu,\nonce I get some coffees first. Um, anyone want any?'
Monica	 Oh, I\xc2\x92d like a latte. Oh y\xc2\x92know what? If you\xc2\x92re gonna\ntalk about me, I\xc2\x92m gonna go with you. '
Chandler	 What are you doing?!'
Phoebe	 Nothing! I swear to God I didn\xc2\x92t know you guys would be here! And\nthe good news is you didn\xc2\x92t believe in soul mates. So\xc2\x85'
Chandler	 I believe in tall, handsome strangers who hit on my wife!'
Phoebe	 They\xc2\x92re just talking, and y\xc2\x92know what? Just because I think\nthey\xc2\x92re soul mates doesn\xc2\x92t mean anything\xc2\x92s gonna happen.'
Monica	 (returning) Phoebe, good work.'
Phoebe	 Yeah?'
Monica	 Yeah! Oh he\xc2\x92s great, I love him. (Walks away and Chandler glares at\nPhoebe.)'
Phoebe	 Don\xc2\x92t worry, we\xc2\x92ll find you someone else.'
Joey	 Hey.'
Ross	 Hey.'
Joey	 Look, I understand if you came by to hit me, I deserve it.'
Ross	 No, I don\xc2\x92t want to hit you.'
Joey	 Oh what then? Kick me?'
Ross	 No.'
Joey	 (getting worried) Bite me?'
Ross	 No, no I don\xc2\x92t want to do anything to you. All right? I just want to\ntell you that I\xc2\x92m not mad at you and\xc2\x85and that I certainly do not hate you. I\njust, I just came here to say that. (Starts to leave.)'
Joey	 Oh now\xc2\x97Hey Ross-Ross! Do you wanna-wanna come in for a beer or\nsomething?'
Ross	 Uh\xc2\x85yeah sure. (Enters.)'
Joey	 Do uh, do you got any beer? All-all I got is this melon stuff that Rachel\nleft. I don\xc2\x92t\xc2\x85'
Ross	 Okay.'
Joey	 (pouring two glasses) Hey look Ross, you need to understand something\nokay? I uh\xc2\x85I am never gonna act on this Rachel thing, okay? I-I would never do\nanything to jeopardize my friendship with you. (He hands Ross a glass.)'
Ross	 Thank you.'
Joey	 Anyway, it uh\xc2\x85look it\xc2\x92ll just\xc2\x85take me a while to get over\nher, that\xc2\x92s all. I\xc2\x92m not even sure how to do that, I mean I\xc2\x92ve never been\nin love before so\xc2\x85'
Ross	 What?! You\xc2\x92re in love with her.'
Joey	 Yeah, I thought you knew that.'
Ross	 Umm, no.'
Joey	 Wow. Hey look, if it helps, I don\xc2\x92t want to feel this way. Honest. I\njust keep thinking, "Ah, I\xc2\x92ll get over this." Y\xc2\x92know? I just\xc2\x97It\njust keeps gettin\xc2\x92 harder. I don\xc2\x92t, I don\xc2\x92t know what to do. Y\xc2\x92know?\nWhat do I do?'
Ross	 I think you need to tell her how you feel.'
Joey	 Okay that\xc2\x92s the green stuff talkin\xc2\x92.'
Ross	 No, I\xc2\x92m serious. You-you need to find out where she is, because if\nshe\xc2\x92s not where you are, then you can start to move past this.'
Joey	 But what if uh\xc2\x97and I\xc2\x92m not saying she will be\xc2\x97But\xc2\x85'
Ross	 If she is where you are then uh\xc2\x85then my feeling weird about it\nshouldn\xc2\x92t stand in the way.'
Joey	 Are you sure?'
Ross	 Yeah. Look if-if she\xc2\x92s gonna end up with somebody else, the truth is\nshe couldn\xc2\x92t find a better guy. So\xc2\x85'
Joey	 Hey thanks.'
Ross	 So when do you think you\xc2\x92re gonna talk to her?'
Joey	 Oh my God I have to tell her! I haven\xc2\x92t even thought about what I\nwill say. What should I say?'
Ross	 I\xc2\x92m understanding, but let\xc2\x92s not get carried away.'
Joey	 I\xc2\x92m sorry, you\xc2\x92re right. What am I gonna say? (He takes another\nsip of the green stuff and recoils at the taste.) Oh!'
Ross	 Yeah, tell me about it. (He stands up, turns his back to Joey, and enjoys\nanother sip.)'

Don	 \xc2\x85so I\xc2\x92ve been slowly phasing out the wine importing and focusing\nmore on the cheese side of things.'
Chandler	 Cheese you say? That\xc2\x92s some pretty smelly work, huh Don?'
Don	 Excuse me?'
Chandler	 Cheese, it\xc2\x92s smelly. You must smell a lot of the time too.'
Don	 Uh, not really. But when it comes to cheese, I\xc2\x92m one of the people who\nthinks the smellier the better.'
Monica	 Me too! Yeah, Chandler can\xc2\x92t stand it. He won\xc2\x92t even allow me\nto have blue cheese in the house.'
Don	 And you\xc2\x92re still married to him? (They both laugh, and Chandler tries\nto but fails.)'
Monica	 You know what I\xc2\x92d love to do? I would like to go to France and eat\nnothing but bread and cheese\xc2\x97Not even bread, just cheese. No, I want the bread. Yeah.\nAh, and pastries\xc2\x85 (Breathlessly) And pate. Oh, I\xc2\x92m really not high, it\xc2\x92s\njust I used to be fat.'
Don	 Well if you where ever enter the Loire valley let me know, I\xc2\x92ve got a\ngreat little villa you can stay at.'
Chandler	 Is it made of cheese?'
Don	 No. But God, a house made of cheese, wouldn\xc2\x92t that be incredible?!'
Monica	 I\xc2\x92d move in tomorrow!'
Chandler	 (disgusted) Oh come on! (To Phoebe) Are you listening to this?'
Phoebe	 I\xc2\x92m so sorry.'
Chandler	 What do we do?'
Phoebe	 I don\xc2\x92t know, they both want to live in a house of cheese! I\ndon\xc2\x92t know how you fight that.'
Joey	 Okay. Okay, I can do this. I can tell her how I feel. Just uh, just stand\nup straight. (Does so.) Take a couple deep breaths. (Does so.) Look confident. (Does so as\nRachel opens the door and startles him.)'
Rachel	 Joey? What\xc2\x92s up?'
Joey	 I uh, I just came by because I-I want to talk to you about something.'
Rachel	 Okay what\xc2\x92s up?'
Joey	 Here? In the hall? What are we animals?'
Rachel	 Well honey, I\xc2\x92m late for a meeting. So can you just make it quick?'
Joey	 Okay umm, I just came by to tell you that I\xc2\x85want to have dinner with\nyou tonight. That\xc2\x92s all.'
Rachel	 Sure! That sounds great! Just leave me a message and tell me where to\nmeet you. Okay? (Walks away.)'
Joey	 Okay. That\xc2\x92s good. Okay, that give you a couple hours to prepare what\nyou\xc2\x92re gonna say. Good. Yeah. (Someone comes out of his apartment and it startles\nJoey again.) Don\xc2\x92t you people ever knock?!'
Monica	 I\xc2\x92d like to have Don and Phoebe over. Wouldn\xc2\x92t that be nice?'
Chandler	 Sure, why don\xc2\x92t you set it up. I\xc2\x92ll just be over here,\nbrowsing through the personals.'
Monica	 Are you okay? You\xc2\x92ve been acting weird all afternoon.'
Chandler	 Yeah, fine. Fine. Not perfect!! But good enough.'
Monica	 Jeez! What is with you?'
Chandler	 I\xc2\x92m sorry, did you say cheese?'
Monica	 All right, what\xc2\x92s going on?'
Chandler	 Phoebe thinks you and Don are soul mates, and I don\xc2\x92t believe in\nthat kind of stuff. But then you two totally get along. So look, I won\xc2\x92t stand in\nyour way if you want to run off with Don and live in a house of cheese.'
Monica	 Chandler, you don\xc2\x92t believe in soul mates?'
Chandler	 No. But I\xc2\x92m sure (mimics Don) \xc2\x91tomatoes\xc2\x92 does.'
Monica	 I don\xc2\x92t believe in soul mates either.'
Chandler	 You don\xc2\x92t?'
Monica	 No. I don\xc2\x92t think that you and I were destined to end up together.\nI think that we fell in love and work hard at our relationship. Some days we work really\nhard.'
Chandler	 So you\xc2\x85you don\xc2\x92t want to live with Don in a cheese house?'
Monica	 No, I\xc2\x92ve had second thoughts about that. Do you realize how hard\nthat would be to clean?'
Chandler	 I love you.'
Monica	 I know.'
Chandler	 Y\xc2\x92know what? I am going to take you out to dinner tonight. I\nfound this place that makes the greatest mozzarella sticks and jalepino poppers . (Monica\ndoesn\xc2\x92t look impressed.) No? Really? They taste so good.'
Rachel	 \xc2\x85and I know Chandler is kidding but it happens every time he\ntouches my stomach. I mean I\xc2\x92m really worried the baby\xc2\x92s not going to like him.\n(Joey is staring at the table.) Are you okay?'
Joey	 What? Yeah! Sure! Uh, look at the uh, the reason\xc2\x85(Exhales\nslowly)\xc2\x97Is it hot in here?'
Rachel	 No. Not-not for me, but why don\xc2\x92t you take off your sweater?'
Joey	 I would, but this is a nice place and my T-shirt has a picture of Calvin\ndoing Hobbs.'
Rachel	 Oh my God! Really?! Can I see it?'
Joey	 Yeah. Sure. (They both half stand up, Joey pulls the neck of his sweater\nout, and Rachel looks down it to see his T-shirt.)'
Rachel	 Huh. Wow, I wouldn\xc2\x92t think Hobbs would like that so much.'
