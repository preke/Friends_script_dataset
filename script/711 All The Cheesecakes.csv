Chandler	 Ohh. Mmm.'
Rachel	 (Comes in the front door and walks towards the kitchen.) Hi.'
Chandler	 Hey, you have got to try this cheesecake.'
Rachel	 Oh, y\xc2\x92know I'm not that much of a sweet tooth. I\xc2\x97(Chandler\nputs a forkful of the cheesecake in her mouth.)\xc2\x97Wow. My God, so creamy. Oh my God,\nthis is the best cheesecake I have ever had. Where did you get this? (She reaches over to\nlook at the label on the box.)"
Chandler	 (nervously) It was at the front door. When I got home. Somebody sent\nit to us.'
Rachel	 Chandler, this is not addressed to you. This is addressed to Mrs.\nBraverman downstairs. (Gasping) Thief.'
Chandler	 I\xc2\x97no! I didn't read the box before I opened it. And you can't\nreturn a box after you've opened the box."
Rachel	 Why, why not?'
Chandler	 Because it's too delicious."
Rachel	 Chandler, you stole this cheesecake. That is wrong.'
Chandler	 No-no-no! It is going to be okay, because Mrs. Braverman is gonna send\naway for a free one and that way we all win! The only losers are the big cheesecake\nconglomerate, (Reading the label) Momma\xc2\x92s Little Bakery. (Pause) I feel terrible,\nI\xc2\x92m a horrible, horrible, horrible person.'
Rachel	 (taking a bite) Oh, I\xc2\x92m sorry what?'

Joey	 All right, I should get going, big day a work. Y\xc2\x92know I\xc2\x92m in a\ncoma? Today, they do this test on me and it turns out I\xc2\x92m not brain dead.'
Chandler	 So\xc2\x85'
Joey	 Ah-ah-ah Mr. Smartie Pants, it\xc2\x92s just not my character that\xc2\x92s\nnot brain dead. Hey, so Pheebs, we still on for tonight?'
Phoebe	 Absolutely!'
Joey	 I\xc2\x92ll see you at 8
Phoebe	 Okay. (Joey exits.) '
Chandler	 Oh, what\xc2\x92s at 8
Phoebe	 Oh, I have dinner plans with Joey. We get together about once a month to\ndiscuss the rest of you guys.'
Ross	 Wow, did not know that! May I say how lovely you look today?'
Phoebe	 Duly noted.'
Ross	 Thanks. (Phoebe gets up to get a refill.) (To Monica) Oh! So for tomorrow,\ndo you want to rent a car and drive down together or what?'
Monica	 What are you talking about?'
Ross	 Cousin Frannie\xc2\x92s wedding, its tomorrow night.'
Monica	 You were invited?!'
Ross	 No.'
Monica	 My God, I can\xc2\x92t believe this! I mean I knew that mom and dad were\ninvited, but I thought that was it! I mean from the ages 7 to 9 Frannie and I were\ninseparable!'
Chandler	 Well, maybe since the age of 9, Frannie\xc2\x92s made some new friends.'
Ross	 Well l-look okay, it\xc2\x92s probably just a mistake. Let me call Aunt\nSheryl okay? Maybe you are invited and the invitation just got lost in the mail.'
Monica	 Yeah, well you call her and tell her that y\xc2\x92know when we were kids\nher precious little Frannie tried to undress me several times, okay? And if I hadn\xc2\x92t\nhave stopped her, there probably wouldn\xc2\x92t even be a wedding to go too.'
Ross	 Y\xc2\x92know, she tried to undress me too.'
Chandler	 I used to undress my cousin Glenn. (Monica looks at him then sushes\nhim.)'
Phoebe	 Joseph Francis Tribbiani are you home yet?!!'
Rachel	 Umm, I think he\xc2\x92s still out. What\xc2\x92s wrong?'
Phoebe	 Well, I\xc2\x92ll tell you Rachel Karen Green, I had plans with Joey\ntonight and he left me this note. (Hands it to Rachel.)'
Rachel	 (reading the note) "Pheebs, can\xc2\x92t make it, got a date. Talk to\nyou later. Big Daddy." (Laughs) Big Daddy?'
Phoebe	 Oh that\xc2\x92s a nickname we were trying out.'
Ross	 Hey, y\xc2\x92know what nickname never caught on? The Ross-A-Tron! (Monica\nshakes her head in disgust.)'
Joey	 (entering) Hey!'
Phoebe	 Oh! Here\xc2\x92s Joseph Francis!'
Joey	 Oh-Wha-Ho! What are you middle naming me for?! I left you a note!'
Phoebe	 So what?! That doesn\xc2\x92t give you the right to ditch me!'
Joey	 Hey, you can cancel plans with friends if there is the possibility for\nsex!'
Ross	 Phoebe he\xc2\x92s right, that is the rule.'
Phoebe	 I don\xc2\x92t accept this rule. When me make plans, I expect you to show\nup. Okay, I can\xc2\x92t just be a way to kill time \xc2\x91til you meet someone better!\nY\xc2\x92know boyfriends and girlfriends come and go, but this (Motions that their\nfriendship) is for life!'
Joey	 Wow! I\xc2\x92m so sorry; I had no idea it would bother you this much.'
Phoebe	 Well, it does.'
Joey	 Okay, can I-can I make it up to you? Huh? I\xc2\x92m sorry. (They hug.) How\nabout uh, dinner tomorrow night?! I\xc2\x92ll pay for myself!'
Phoebe	 Okay, you wore me down.'
Ross	 Hey Joe, while you\xc2\x92re over there how about another beer for the\nRoss-A-Tron?'
Joey	 The Ross\xc2\x97Is that back?!! (Chandler motions no.)'
Rachel	 Hi!'
Chandler	 Another cheesecake came! They delivered it to the wrong address again!'
Rachel	 So just bring it back downstairs, what\xc2\x92s the problem?'
Chandler	 I can\xc2\x92t seem to say goodbye.'
Rachel	 Are you serious?! Chandler, we ate an entire cheesecake two days ago and\nyou want more?'
Chandler	 Well I\xc2\x92ve forgotten what it tastes like okay?!'
Rachel	 It was cheesecake. It was fine. It had a buttery, crumbly, graham\ncracker crust, with a very rich yet light, cream cheese filling\xc2\x85 (Pause) Wow! My\nwhole mouth just filled with saliva! '
Chandler	 (closing the box) Y\xc2\x92know what? Forget it! We are just\nhungry! We have not had lunch! We are just light-headed! So let us go out and have lunch\nand forget about the cheesecake.'
Rachel	 Yeah and we\xc2\x92ll drop it off downstairs so that we\xc2\x92re not\ntempted.'
Chandler	 Good idea. Where do you want to go to lunch?'
Rachel	 Momma\xc2\x92s Little Bakery, Chicago, Illinois. (They exit with the\ncheesecake.)'
Joey	 Awww! Mel Torme died.'
Monica	 Joey, that paper\xc2\x92s like a year old!'
Joey	 Aw! Does that mean the Sam Goody\xc2\x92s sale is over?!'
Ross	 (entering) Hey.'
Joey	 Hey.'
Monica	 Hey.'
Ross	 So I finally heard back from Aunt Sheryl and apparently it wasn\xc2\x92t\na mistake. Ahh, there\xc2\x92s-there\xc2\x92s limited seating in the hall.'
Monica	 Limited seating?! (Screechingly) I am just one tiny person!'
Ross	 Well yeah, but she doesn\xc2\x92t know that. I mean, the last time she saw\nyou-you would\xc2\x92ve turned one of those little wedding chairs into kindling. '
Monica	 (disgusted) Limited seating! Oh, that is such a lame excuse! That\xc2\x92s\nnot the reason she\xc2\x92s not inviting me!'
Ross	 Oh what\xc2\x92s the big deal?! I wasn\xc2\x92t even invited to the ceremony,\njust the reception. And-and y\xc2\x92know what? If it makes you feel any better, Joan and I\nwill just make an appearance and then, and then we\xc2\x92ll-we\xc2\x92ll leave early as a\nsign of protest.'
Monica	 Joan?'
Ross	 Yeah, Joan Tedeski my date. She\xc2\x92s an assistant professor in the\nLinguistics department. Tall, very beautiful, and despite what some people say, not\nbroad backed!'
Monica	 Wait a minute, you got Ross Gellar and guest?! I wasn\xc2\x92t invited and\nyou got "and guest?!"'
Joey	 Uh-uh, excuse me, I do have to interrupt on Ross\xc2\x92s behalf. I-I think\nthe rule applies here y\xc2\x92know, since she has a chance to get on broad back\xc2\x85'
Ross	 (interrupting) Not broad backed!'
Monica	 Wait a minute, y\xc2\x92know, you\xc2\x92re bringing me!'
Ross	 What? I can\xc2\x92t cancel on Joan!'
Monica	 Why not?!'
Ross	 Bec\xc2\x97Did you not hear me?! She\xc2\x92s an assistant professor in the\nLinguistics department, okay? They\xc2\x92re wild! Why do you want to come anyway?'
Monica	 Because! She\xc2\x92s my cousin. I mean, we grew up together! We\xc2\x92re\nfamily y\xc2\x92know? Well that\xc2\x92s important to me.'
Ross	 Okay, all right, I\xc2\x92ll take you. I\xc2\x92ll go call Joan. (Does so.)'
Joey	 Aww that\xc2\x92s nice. Family should be there, huh? This is her wedding,\nhappiest day of her life.'
Monica	 (laughs) We\xc2\x92ll see.'
Chandler	 Well, thank you for lunch.'
Rachel	 What? Wait a minute, I didn\xc2\x92t pay, I thought you paid!'
Chandler	 So apparently we just don\xc2\x92t pay for food anymore. (Rachel laughs\nthen Chandler notices something.) Do you see what I see?'
Rachel	 (gasps) Its still there! (The cheesecake they returned to Mrs. Braverman\nis still lying in front of her door.)'
Chandler	 Mrs. Braverman must be out. (They move closer to it.)'
Rachel	 She could be out of town. Maybe she\xc2\x92ll be gone for months.'
Chandler	 By then, the cheesecake may have gone bad. We don\xc2\x92t want her to\ncome back to bad cheesecake.'
Rachel	 No that could kill her.'
Chandler	 Well, we don\xc2\x92t want that.'
Rachel	 No so we\xc2\x92re protecting her.'
Chandler	 But we should take it.'
Rachel	 But we should move quick.'
Chandler	 Why?'
Rachel	 Because I think I just heard her moving around in there.'
Chandler	 Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! (Rachel grabs the cheesecake\nand they take off upstairs.)'
Phoebe	 (gasps) (whispering) Oh my God! That\xc2\x92s David!'
Monica	 David who?'
Phoebe	 David the scientist guy, David that I was in love with, David who went\nto Russia and broke my heart David!'
David	 (noticing Phoebe) Oh my God!'
Phoebe	 Oh, you say someone\xc2\x92s name enough, they turn around.'
David	 Phoebe?'
Phoebe	 David! (He kisses her cheek) What-what are you doing here? Aren\xc2\x92t\nyou supposed to be in Russia?'
David	 Yeah, I\xc2\x92m just, I\xc2\x92m just in town for a conference. Umm, God\nyou look phenomenal!'
Phoebe	 Well\xc2\x85 Yeah. You look great too. Did you get a haircut?'
David	 Yeah. Well I-I got like thirty of them.'
Phoebe	 Yeah.'
David	 Umm, look I-I-I got a confession to make\xc2\x85'
Phoebe	 Uh-huh.'
David	 Uh, I-I-I was hoping to run into you here. I didn\xc2\x92t know whether I\nshould call or not, y\xc2\x92know I-I was only in town for a few days. And y\xc2\x92know, I\ndidn\xc2\x92t want to intrude on your life or-or anything like that, but I-I really wanted\nto see you and\xc2\x97but I didn\xc2\x92t know if you wanted to see me.'
Phoebe	 Well, of course I would want to see you. I\xc2\x85I think about you all\nthe time.'
David	 Really? Because I think about you all the time. '
Phoebe	 Really?'
David	 I mean, there\xc2\x92s a statue in Minsk\xc2\x85'
Phoebe	 Uh-huh.'
David	 That reminds me of you so much, I mean umm, it-it\xc2\x92s actually\nof Lenin. But, y\xc2\x92know at certain angles\xc2\x85'

Phoebe	 I can\xc2\x92t. I can\xc2\x92t believe I have plans, I can\xc2\x92t. Can you\ndo it tomorrow night though?'
David	 Uh no, I have to go in a few hours. I have to be on the red-eye. Well\nlisten, y\xc2\x92know, next time you\xc2\x92re in Minsk umm\xc2\x85'
Monica	 Phoebe, can I talk to you for a second?'
Phoebe	 Uh-huh. (They go over and talk.)'
Monica	 What are you doing?'
Phoebe	 Well, I have plans with Joey tonight.'
Monica	 So! He\xc2\x92ll understand!'
Phoebe	 No he won\xc2\x92t. And that\xc2\x92s not even the point! Monica, I made a\nwhole speech about you do not cancel plans with friends! And now y\xc2\x92know what? Just\nbecause, potentially, the love of my life comes back from Russia just for one night, I-I\nshould change my beliefs?! I should change beliefs! No! No! No, if I don\xc2\x92t have my\nprinciples, I don\xc2\x92t have anything!'

Chandler	 Oh really? Uh, Monica said she had a date at 9
Joey	 What?! Tonight?!'
Chandler	 That\xc2\x92s what Monica said.'
Joey	 After she gave me that big speech?! She goes and makes a date with a guy\non the same night she has plans with me? I think she\xc2\x92s trying to pull a fast one on\nBig Daddy!'
Ross	 Oh here, I think this is us. (Reading the name cards.) Yeah.'
Monica	 Limited seating my ass. Let\xc2\x92s see who made the cut. (To the couple\nsitting to her right.) Hi!'

Phoebe	 Oh Joey, we\xc2\x92ve heard the specials three times! Okay? There\xc2\x92s\nprime rib, mahi mahi, and a very special lobster ravioli. (She grabs his menu and hands it\nto the waiter.)'
The Waiter	 Actually we\xc2\x92re out of the lobster ravioli. (Putting Joey\xc2\x92s\nmenu under his arm.)'
Joey	 Oh well, that changes everything! (Grabs his menu and starts looking at it\nagain. The waiter leaves.) Y\xc2\x92know what Pheebs?'

Joey	 Whoa-whoa, what is it?'
Phoebe	 Well\xc2\x85 It\xc2\x92s a date.'

Phoebe	 Come on Joey, don\xc2\x92t make me feel badly about this.'
Joey	 No, I\xc2\x92m gonna!! That\xc2\x92s right! Yeah, you made me feel really\nguilty about goin\xc2\x92 out with that girl! Like-like-like I did something terrible to\nyou! And now Pheebs, you\xc2\x92re doing the same thing!'
Phoebe	 That\xc2\x97It\xc2\x92s not the same thing! This is totally\ndifferent! This is with David! Remember David, the scientist guy? Okay, he\xc2\x92s very\nspecial to me.'
Joey	 Okay, well my girl from the other night was special. She was a scientist\ntoo!'
Phoebe	 She was?'
Joey	 Well, she graduated from high school!'
Phoebe	 Okay, whatever. Y\xc2\x92know what? I don\xc2\x92t have time have time to\nconvince you because he\xc2\x92s only here for four hours, and I\xc2\x92m gonna go see him!\n(Gets up and leaves.)'

Phoebe	 Hey!'
David	 Hey! Oh, I was just about to leave. I-I-I-I didn\xc2\x92t think you were\ncoming.'
Phoebe	 Oh, I wouldn\xc2\x92t miss this.'
David	 Well, I\xc2\x92m very glad you\xc2\x92re here. (Kisses her hand.)'
Phoebe	 Oh, you\xc2\x92re such a gentleman. (Grabs his arm.) Come on! We\xc2\x92re\ngoing to my place! (Drags him off to her place.)'
Chandler	 Are you eating the cheesecake without me?!'
Rachel	 (with a mouthful) Mm-mmm. (Nods no.)'
Chandler	 I will give you a hundred dollars to whistle right now. (She tries to\nwhistle and blows little chunks of cheesecake out of her mouth.) How can you eat the\ncheesecake without me?!'
Rachel	 Oh, what are you going to do?! Are you gonna go run tell Monica?! Are\nyou gonna tell Joey?! No! Because then you will have to tell them what we did! We are\ndesert stealers! We are living outside the law!'
Chandler	 Y\xc2\x92know what? I don\xc2\x92t trust you with this cake anymore! And I\ngot it first, and I\xc2\x92m takin\xc2\x92 it back! (Grabs the cheesecake and heads for his\napartment.)'
Rachel	 What?! What?!'
Chandler	 Oh yes! '
Rachel	 Wait a minute!'
Chandler	 Oh yes!'
Rachel	 Oh no-no-no-no-no, no you don\xc2\x92t!'
Chandler	 Oh yes! Oh yes!'
Rachel	 You think I trust you with it?! No! We\xc2\x92re gonna split it! You take\nhalf and I take half!'
Chandler	 Well that\xc2\x92s not fair, you\xc2\x92ve already had some!'
Rachel	 What? Oh, well then y\xc2\x92know what? I think Monica would be very\ninterested to know that you called her cheesecake dry and mealy.'
Chandler	 What do we use to split it?'
Rachel	 Okay! (Grabs a knife and cuts it in half.) All right, pick a half.'
Chandler	 (examining the cake) Okay well, this side looks bigger. Uh\xc2\x85\nThere\xc2\x92s more crust on this side. Y\xc2\x92know? So, maybe if I measured\xc2\x85'
Rachel	 Oh for God sake just pick a piece!'
Chandler	 All right, I\xc2\x92ll pick that one. (Points.)'
Rachel	 That\xc2\x92s also the smaller piece. (Puts the piece onto a plate.) Okay,\nthere you go. Enjoy your half my friend, but that is it. No sharing. No switching, and\ndon\xc2\x92t come crying to me if you eat your piece to fast. (As she\xc2\x92s saying\nthat she is backing out the door, when she finishes she turns around to return to her\nplace, stumbles and drops the cheesecake on the floor.) Oh!!!!'
Chandler	 (gloatingly and holding his piece) Ohhh!'
Rachel	 Okay, you gotta give me some of your piece.'
Chandler	 Oh-ho-ho-ho-no! No! No switching! No sharing, and don\xc2\x92t come\ncrying to me! Ha-ha-ha! I may just sit here and have my cake all day! Just sit here in the\nhallway and eat my\xc2\x85 (Rachel knocks the plate from his hand and it falls on the floor.\nThat process leaves just the forkful Chandler has, Rachel starts to go after that little\nbit and Chandler retreats into his apartment.) '
Ross	 Oh, hey Aunt Millie.'
Aunt Millie	 Isn\xc2\x92t it a beautiful wedding?!'
Ross	 Yes, yes it is. It\xc2\x92s uh\xc2\x85 (Aunt Millie uses this opportunity to\ngrab Ross and kiss him on the lips. After she leaves Ross quickly wipes his mouth with a\nnapkin.) Every time on the lips! Why?! Why on lips?!'
Monica	 Here\xc2\x92s Frannie. Hmm, won\xc2\x92t she be happy to see me? (Starts to\nget up and great Frannie.)'
Ross	 Now wait a minute, you be nice! All right? I didn\xc2\x92t bring you here so\nyou can ambush her.'
Monica	 Frannie was the one who found your Playboys and showed them to\nmom.'
Ross	 That bitch! (He gets up and they go over to ambush Frannie. Monica taps on\nFrannie\xc2\x92s shoulder.)'
Frannie	 (turning around) Monica! What\xc2\x85'
Monica	 Am I doing here? Why? Surprised to see me? Ross brought me. How do you\nlike that?!'
Ross	 (to Frannie) Hi Frannie, congratulations.'
Monica	 You invite my brother, you invite my whole family, and not me?! Why?!\nWhat\xc2\x97Why wouldn\xc2\x92t you want me at your wedding? What could I have possibly done?!\n(Frannie\xc2\x92s husband walks up.) Stuart!'
Frannie	 I believe you know my husband.'
Ross	 So it\xc2\x92s really a question of who could you have possibly done.'
David	 Oh, I hate this but I-I-I have to go. I-I can\xc2\x92t miss my\nflight.'
Phoebe	 Are you sure? I\xc2\x92ll bet there\xc2\x92s another flight to Minsk in\nlike\xc2\x85'
David	 July. Umm, (He speaks Russian.) '
Phoebe	 That\xc2\x92s really beautiful. What does it mean?'
David	 Please, clean my beakers. I don\xc2\x92t get out of the lab much.'
Phoebe	 That\xc2\x92s good. I got to admit, I thought it was something else.'
David	 Yeah, I\xc2\x85 Well I really actually wanted to say umm, that, but um, I\nfigured I probably shouldn\xc2\x92t because y\xc2\x92know, I\xc2\x85have to leave.'
Phoebe	 You\xc2\x92re right! You\xc2\x92re right. Don\xc2\x92t say it. '
David	 I-I do though.'
Phoebe	 I do too. (They kiss.)'
David	 Bye Phoebe. (He gets in and the cab drives off. Joey walks up and\nwitnesses that event.)'
Phoebe	 (seeing him) Okay, now\xc2\x92s not the time Joey. All right? You can yell\nat me tomorrow.'
Joey	 No! No! No Pheebs, I\xc2\x92m not gonna yell at you. I just y\xc2\x92know,\nstarted thinking about you and David and I\xc2\x85remember how bummed you were the first\ntime he left. And I just\xc2\x85 Oh Pheebs, come here. (He hugs her.) Are you okay?'
Phoebe	 No I\xc2\x92m not okay. The only guy I\xc2\x92ve ever been crazy about has\ngone to Minsk and I may never\xc2\x85I may never see him again. (Crying.)'
Joey	 Hey, y\xc2\x92know you could always visit him.'
Phoebe	 Oh right, like they\xc2\x92re gonna let me have a passport.'
Joey	 Anything I can do? Whatever you need.'
Phoebe	 Well\xc2\x97But\xc2\x97Now, if-if you can achieve positronic distillation of\nsub-atomic particles y\xc2\x92know before he does, then he can come back. (They hug again.)'
Joey	 I can give it a shot.'
Rachel	 Oh! Yay! Look! There\xc2\x92s a piece that doesn\xc2\x92t have floor on it!'
Chandler	 Stick to your side!'
Rachel	 Hey, come on now!'
Joey	 (pulls out a fork) All right, what are we havin\xc2\x92? (Starts digging\nin.)'

Monica	 Oh wait I forgot my wrap.'
Ross	 What? Oh, okay. Wait here. (Goes to get it, but before he gets there Aunt\nMillie sits down on it forcing him to pull it out from behind her which gets her\nattention.)'
Aunt Millie	 Hi sweetie! Are you leaving?'
Ross	 Well\xc2\x85'
Aunt Millie	 Give us a kiss. Come on! Come on! '
Ross	 Why?! Why on the lips?! (He wipes his mouth on Monica\xc2\x92s wrap and\nwalks off, leaving Aunt Millie stunned.)'
