Joey	 Hey Rach listen, did you know that during pregnancy your fingers swell up\nto twice their size and never go back.'
Rachel	 (looking at her fingers) Oh my\xc2\x85God! Let me see that! (Grabs the\nbook from him.)'
Joey	 (laughing) You fall for it every time!'
Phoebe	 (entering) Hey!'
Rachel	 Hi!'
Phoebe	 I brought you my old maternity clothes! (Sets a bag on the counter.)'
Rachel	 Oh Pheebs that\xc2\x92s so sweet\xc2\x97(Grabs a pair of pants)\xc2\x97Ooh,\nthose are so cute!'
Phoebe	 Yeah! And look, (Grabs the pants) see how they expand as the baby grows?\n(There\xc2\x92s a stretchy part in front.) And then after the baby\xc2\x92s born, they\xc2\x92re\ngreat for shoplifting melons.'
Monica	 (entering) Oh good you\xc2\x92re all here. Thanksgiving tomorrow, four\no\xc2\x92clock. (To Rachel) Oh, guess who I invited. Remember that guy Will Colbert from\nhigh school?'
Rachel	 No.'
Monica	 He was in Ross\xc2\x92s class\xc2\x85marching band\xc2\x85kinda overweight?\nWell, really overweight. I mean I was his thin friend.'
Rachel	 Wow! I don\xc2\x92t remember him. Honey, are you sure you\xc2\x92re not\ntalking about your imaginary boyfriend.'
Monica	 No that was Jarred! Wow! I haven\xc2\x92t thought about him in a long\ntime\xc2\x85 (Stares off into the distance lost in thought.) (Pause) Anyway, umm\nWill\xc2\x92s, Will\xc2\x92s here on business and he didn\xc2\x92t have a place to go so I\ninvited him here.'
Rachel	 Oh that\xc2\x92s nice.'
Monica	 Oh, and by the way, he\xc2\x92s lost a bunch of weight. I mean he looks\ngoo-ood! Okay, I mean really, really gorgeous! (Joey clears his throat.) I still\nlove Chandler.'
Joey	 I just want you to say it once in a while.'
Monica	 All right okay, just so you know, I\xc2\x92m not gonna make a turkey this\nyear.'
Joey	 What?!'
Monica	 Well Phoebe doesn\xc2\x92t eat turkey\xc2\x85'
Joey	 Phoebe!'
Phoebe	 Turkey\xc2\x92s are beautiful, intelligent animals!'
Joey	 No they\xc2\x92re not! They\xc2\x92re ugly and stupid and delicious!'
Monica	 All right! Okay, it\xc2\x92s just Phoebe. Will\xc2\x92s still on a diet,\nChandler doesn\xc2\x92t eat Thanksgiving food, and Rachel\xc2\x92s having her aversion to\npoultry.'
Joey	 She is?'
Rachel	 Remember I had to leave the room the other day when you had that roast\nchicken?'
Joey	 Yeah. But I thought that was because I put the whole thing on my hand and\nmade it walk across the table.'
Monica	 Anyway, it just doesn\xc2\x92t seem worth it to make a whole turkey for\njust three people. Okay? It\xc2\x92s a lot of work.'
Joey	 But you gotta have turkey on Thanksgiving! I mean, Thanksgiving with no\nturkey is like-like Fourth of July with no apple pie! Or Friday with no two pizzas!'
Monica	 All right fine! If it means that much to you! But just\xc2\x97there\xc2\x92s\ngonna be a ton left over.'
Joey	 No there won\xc2\x92t! I promise I will finish that turkey!'
Monica	 All right, you\xc2\x92re telling me you can eat an entire turkey in just\none sitting?'
Joey	 That\xc2\x92s right! \xc2\x91Cause I\xc2\x92m a Tribbiani! (To Rachel) And this\nis what we do! I mean we may not be great thinkers or world leaders, we don\xc2\x92t read a\nlot or run very fast, but damnit! We can eat!'

Monica	 Hey, isn\xc2\x92t weird to think about how next year at this time\nthey\xc2\x92ll be a little baby at the table? (Chandler turns around in horror.) (Seeing\nhim) Rachel\xc2\x92s! But good to know where you\xc2\x92re at!'
Phoebe	 (entering) Hey!'
Monica	 Hey!'
Phoebe	 Happy Thanksgiving!'
Monica	 You too!'
Phoebe	 Anything I can do to help?'
Monica	 Actually there is. Chandler usually helps me with this, but he\xc2\x92s\nreally into the game so I don\xc2\x92t want to bother him. Could you help me fold these\nnapkins? (Hands her a stack of them.)'
Phoebe	 Sure!'
Monica	 I\xc2\x92m gonna go across the hall to check on the yams.'
Phoebe	 Okay. (She starts folding the napkins in half.)'
Monica	 No! No! No! No sweetie! No! Not like that! We\xc2\x92re not at a barn\ndance. You\xc2\x92ve gotta\xc2\x97you wanna fold them like swans. Like I showed you at\nChristmas time, remember?'
Phoebe	 Yeah, it all just came screaming back to me. (Monica exits.) (To\nChandler) So how\xc2\x92s the game?'
Chandler	 I have no idea.'
Phoebe	 What?'
Chandler	 Yeah! I\xc2\x92m just pretending to watch the game so I don\xc2\x92t have\nto help out with stuff.'
Phoebe	 I don\xc2\x92t believe you! That is\xc2\x85brilliant! And Monica has no\nidea?'
Chandler	 Nope! Every once and a while I just scream stuff at the TV. '
Monica	 Is your team winning hon?'
Chandler	 Yeah! Anderson just scored again! (To Phoebe) There\xc2\x92s no\nAnderson.'
Phoebe	 Well I want to get in on this. Hey Mon? I don\xc2\x92t think I can help\nyou after all, I didn\xc2\x92t realize this game was on.'
Monica	 Oh, I didn\xc2\x92t know you liked football.'
Phoebe	 Well normally I don\xc2\x92t, but y\xc2\x92know\xc2\x85(looks at the\nTV)\xc2\x85Green Bay is playing.'
Monica	 You like Green Bay?'
Phoebe	 Well it\xc2\x92s only like my favorite bay! {Actually, it\xc2\x92s not bad.\nIt just gets a little cold in winter, but in Wisconsin winter only lasts from August to\nJune. J }'
Monica	 Hey!'
Will	 Hey!'
Will	 Happy Thanksgiving!'
Monica	 Aww thanks! God Will I\xc2\x92m so glad that you came! You look great! You\nmust\xc2\x92ve lost like\xc2\x85'
Will	 150 pounds. Yeah, I\xc2\x92m gonna be in one of those Subway sandwich\ncommercials.'
Monica	 A pie! (Will brought a pie.)'
Will	 Oh right. All right, it\xc2\x92s no fat, it\xc2\x92s no sugar, it\xc2\x92s no\ndairy\xc2\x85it\xc2\x92s no good. Throw it out.'
Monica	 You wanna meet some people? This is uh; this is my husband Chandler.\nChandler, this is Will.'
Will	 Hey.'
Chandler	 Oh hey. I\xc2\x92d shake your hand but uh; I\xc2\x92m really into the\ngame. Plus, I think it\xc2\x92d be better for my ego if we didn\xc2\x92t stand right next to\neach other.'
Monica	 This is Phoebe.'
Phoebe	 (nonchalantly glancing) Hey. (Turns back around.) Wow! (Looks up.) Well\ndone.'
Monica	 (to Will) Wanna give me a hand?'
Will	 Sure! Monica, I can\xc2\x92t get over how great you look! You look stunning!'
Monica	 Well you look incredible too! You\xc2\x92re just\xc2\x97you\xc2\x92re so fit!'
Chandler	 I\xc2\x92m watching the game, but I\xc2\x92m not deaf!'
Monica	 Oh umm, I meant to tell you, Ross is coming.'
Will	 Ross is coming. Great! I love Ross!'
Monica	 Good. And Rachel Green too. (Will stops suddenly.)'
Will	 Oh.'
Monica	 Is there a problem?'
Will	 Nope. Uh, it\xc2\x92s okay. It\xc2\x92s just uh, God I hated her.'
Monica	 What?'
Will	 Yeah, I hated her. She was horrible to me in high school. But hey, it was\na long time ago, I\xc2\x92m in a good place, it might be actually fun to see her again. You\ngot any cakes or cookies or something? (Starts looking.) No Will no!'
Chandler	 (To Phoebe) Y\xc2\x92know, it\xc2\x92s been a while since we\xc2\x92ve\nscreamed something. Maybe we should.'
Phoebe	 Oh okay.'
Chandler	 Oh come on!'
Phoebe	 Noooo!! Damn you ref! You burn in hell!!!'
Monica	 Hey, what are you doing? You gotta save room, you\xc2\x92ve got almost an\nentire turkey to eat.'
Joey	 Let me explain to you how the human body works. I have to warm my stomach\nfirst. Eatin\xc2\x92 chips is like stretching.'
Monica	 All right.'
Joey	 Don\xc2\x92t worry, Tribbianis never get full.'
Will	 I actually know what you\xc2\x92re talking about. I\xc2\x92m here to tell you\nsomething my friend, you can eat and eat and eat but nothing will ever fill that void.'
Joey	 (To Monica) Who the hell is this guy?'
Monica	 Will! From high school.'
Joey	 Oh hey!'
Monica	 (to Will) Joey.'
Will	 Hello.'
Ross	 (entering) Will!'
Will	 Ross!'
Ross	 Hey-hey you came! Man you look incredible! Hot stuff! (They hug and Ross\nrealizes what he said.) Hot stuff?'
Will	 It\xc2\x92s good to see you man.'
Ross	 Yeah, you too. Man, so-so what are you up to?'
Will	 I\xc2\x92m a commodities broker.'
Ross	 Really? Yeah that-that sounds interesting.'
Will	 Yeah, it\xc2\x92s not. But I\xc2\x92m rich and thin.'
Ross	 Oh! Man I don\xc2\x92t think I\xc2\x92ve seen you since uh, Lance Davis\xc2\x92\ngraduation party.'
Will	 That was such a fun night!'
Ross	 Yeah. It would\xc2\x92ve been good if we had gotten in, but still real fun.'
Will	 Yeah.'
Ross	 Yeah.'
Will	 God we were lame back then. Do you remember how into dinosaurs we were?'
Ross	 (laughs) Yeah.'
Will	 So what do you, what do you do now?'
Ross	 So how long are you in town?'
Rachel	 (entering, carrying a baking dish) Hi! '
Monica	 Hey sweetie. Oh good. (Takes the baking dish from her.)'
Will	 (glaring at Rachel) Rachel Green.'
Ross	 Aw\xc2\x97oh, that\xc2\x92s right. Are-are you gonna be okay?'
Will	 Oh, I\xc2\x92ll-I\xc2\x92ll be fine. Just God I hate her Ross! I hate her!'
Ross	 Will, high school was-was a long time ago.'
Will	 Look at her standing there with those yams! My two greatest enemies Ross
Rachel	 (sees Will) Oh my God Monica, who is that?'
Monica	 That\xc2\x92s Will from high school!'
Rachel	 Oh! I do not remember him! Wow! He\'s really got that sexy, smoldering\nthing going on. (We see Will angrily staring at Rachel.) Oh my God, he\xc2\x92s\xc2\x85 Look\nat the way he\xc2\x92s just staring at me. I think he\xc2\x92s trying to mouth something to\nme, but I can\xc2\x92t make it out. (Will mouths, "I hate you.")'
Monica	 Okay, dinner\xc2\x92s ready!'
Chandler	 Good game!'
Phoebe	 Yeah.'
Chandler	 Yeah. Solid effort. Solid effort.'
Monica	 Oh, so who won?'
Phoebe	 (simultaneously) Green Bay.'
Chandler	 (simultaneously) Detroit.'
Monica	 What?'
Phoebe	 Well the Lions technically won, but it was a moral victory for the Green\nBay\xc2\x85Mermen.'
Rachel	 Hi! Will, right?'
Will	 Right.'
Rachel	 Hi! I\xc2\x92m Rachel Green.'
Will	 Oh I-I remember you.'
Rachel	 Really?! Aren\xc2\x92t you sweet! I gotta tell you though, I am, I am\nhaving the hardest time placing you. Oh-oh hang on! Did we umm, did we fool around at\nLance Davis\xc2\x92 graduation party?'
Will	 You are unbelievable.'
Rachel	 Thank you!'
Monica	 (breaking it up) Uh Rachel? Rachel, why don\xc2\x92t you sit here? (Next\nto Joey) And Will you sit way over there. (The other side of the table.)'
Joey	 That\xc2\x92s it?! Even if nobody helps me I can eat that no problem. At\nleast give me a challenge!'
Monica	 (laughs) This is Chandler\xc2\x92s chicken. This is the turkey. (Sets down\na huge turkey.)'
Joey	 (quietly) Oh. How-how big is that?'
Monica	 About nineteen pounds.'
Joey	 (To Rachel) It\xc2\x92s like me when I was born.'
Rachel	 All right, who would uh, like some yams? Will?'
Will	 Oh, you\xc2\x92d like that wouldn\xc2\x92t ya?'
Rachel	 What? (Joey starts offering Ross some turkey.) Oh y\xc2\x92know what? Can\nwe please keep the chicken and the turkey and everything on the other side of the table?\nThe smell is just yuck!'
Will	 (sneeze talks) Typical.'
Rachel	 I\xc2\x92m sorry. What?'
Will	 I said it was typical. Typical of you, Rachel Green, Queen Rachel does\nwhatever she wants in little Rachel land. (Does a fake hair flip.)'
Joey	 (To Monica) Seriously, who is this guy?'
Rachel	 Umm, I\xc2\x92m sorry. Do you-do you have a problem with me?'
Will	 I don\xc2\x92t know? Do I? Do I?'
Phoebe	 I think you do.'
Monica	 (To Rachel) Apparently you were umm, a little mean to him in high\nschool.'
Will	 A little mean? You made my life miserable!'
Rachel	 I\xc2\x92m-I\xc2\x92m\xc2\x97I had no idea. I\xc2\x92m sorry. I\xc2\x85'
Will	 Well you should be. Screw it! Bring on the yams!'
Monica	 Oh Will. But you-you\xc2\x92ve worked so hard\xc2\x85'
Will	 Yams!!!! '
Monica	 Okay. (Chandler grabs the dish from Monica and hands it to Will who\nstarts dishing out a large helping.)'
Rachel	 Uh Will umm, I just want to say that I\xc2\x92m real sorry for whatever\nI-I did to you in high school\xc2\x85'
Will	 Oh, it wasn\xc2\x92t just me. We had a club!'
Rachel	 You had a club?!'
Will	 That\xc2\x92s right, The I Hate Rachel Green Club!'
Rachel	 Whoa! My God! So what, you all just joined together to hate me?! Who\nelse was in this club?'
Will	 Me and Ross. (Points at Ross.)'
Ross	 No need to point, she knows who Ross is.'

Rachel	 (To Ross) So you were in an I Hate Rachel club?'
Will	 Yes he was. (Holds up his hand for a high-five.)'
Ross	 No. No.'
Rachel	 So who else was in this club?'
Ross	 Uh actually, there-there was also that exchange student from Thailand but\nI-I don\xc2\x92t think he-he knew what it was.'
Rachel	 So Ross, we went out for two years, and you never told me you were in an\nI Hate Rachel club.'
Will	 You went out with her?! We had a pact!'
Ross	 That was in high school! It\xc2\x92s not like it was binding forever.'
Will	 Then why did it have the word eternity in it?'
Rachel	 Okay Monica, did you know about this?!'
Monica	 I swear I didn\xc2\x92t. (To Ross and Will) Hey! Is that why you guys used\nto go up to your bedroom and lock the door?'
Ross and Will	 Yeah.'
Monica	 Hmm, a little relieved, I gotta say.'
Ross	 Look Rach I-I\xc2\x92m sorry, okay? I\xc2\x85I was a stupid kid, okay? The\nonly reason I joined\xc2\x85'
Will	 Co-founded!'
Ross	 \xc2\x85co-founded. Co-founded the club was because I was insanely in love\nwith you. Obviously I didn\xc2\x92t handle it very well. But if you think about it the I\nHate Rachel Club was really the I Love Rachel Club.'
Will	 Uh, except that it was really the I Hate Rachel Club.'
Rachel	 Okay. So what? You guys would just like get together and like just say\nmean things about me?'
Will	 Well, we did a little more than that.'
Ross	 No-no! No-no. No-no.'
Phoebe	 What?! What else did you do?'
Will	 We started a rumor.'
Rachel	 What rumor?'
Phoebe	 Oh, come on Will! Just take off your shirt and tell us!'
Rachel	 Ross!'
Ross	 It was no big deal. We-we\xc2\x85said that the rumor was\xc2\x85that\numm\xc2\x85you had both\xc2\x85male and female reproductive parts.'
Rachel	 What?!'
Will	 That\xc2\x92s right! We said your parents flipped a coin, decided to raise\nyou as a girl, but you still had a hint of a penis.'
Rachel	 (shocked) Oh my God!'
Monica	 You started that?!'
Rachel	 What?! You heard that?! (Goes and stands behind Joey.)'
Monica	 Everyone at our school heard it!'
Chandler	 Everybody at my school heard it! You were the hermaphrodite\ncheerleader from Long Island?!'
Rachel	 Oh no!!!! Oh my God!! This is all making so much sense to me now! This\nis why Adam Carter wouldn\xc2\x92t go out with me! This is why Billy Tratt would just stay\nin this region! (Motions to her breasts.) (Joey has turned around.)'
Ross	 Actually, Billy Tratt is gay now. So-so that one\xc2\x92s not really our\nfault.'
Rachel	 Monica, how come you never told me this?!'
Monica	 I thought it might be true. And I was afraid that you were gonna cry and\nthen show it to me.'
Rachel	 Joey stop staring! There\xc2\x92s nothing there! It\xc2\x92s not true!'
Joey	 I\xc2\x92m afraid I\xc2\x92m gonna need proof.'
Rachel	 Oh! (Hits him and storms out.)'
Joey	 You are my Everest.'
Monica	 Joey, you don\xc2\x92t have to finish that.'
Joey	 Oh yes I do. Otherwise what\xc2\x92s next? Today I\xc2\x92m just a guy who\ncan\xc2\x92t finish a turkey, but tomorrow I\xc2\x92m the guy who eats half a Powerbar,\nwraps up the rest, and puts in the fridge? No! No, I just\xc2\x85I just\xc2\x97I gotta change\nmy pants. (Gets up and heads for the door.) Jeans have no give. (Exits.)'
Rachel	 (entering carrying a book) Okay! Okay! Listen to what Sean McMahon wrote\nin my yearbook senior year, "Dear Rach, you\xc2\x92re such a good person." Not\ngirl! Person!'
Ross	 Rach, I think you\xc2\x92re reading a little too much into it.'
Rachel	 (reading what he wrote again) "Dear Rach, you\xc2\x92re a great\nperson. Sorry about your tiney-wienie." (Will laughs.)'
Ross	 Look, what do you want me to do? Do you want me to call everyone in the\nentire school and tell them it wasn\xc2\x92t true?!'
Rachel	 Yes!'
Will	 Could you also tell them I\xc2\x92m skinny now?'
Monica	 Oh! Me too!'
Ross	 Well look-look I\xc2\x92m not calling anybody! Okay? It was like a million\nyears ago!'
Rachel	 I don\xc2\x92t care how long ago it was! You told people that I was half\nand half! Y\xc2\x92know what? I just want to point out I never did anything to hurt you in\nhigh school.'
Monica	 That\xc2\x92s not totally true.'
Rachel	 What?'
Ross	 What?'
Monica	 Well you-you did start that rumor about Ross making out with Mrs.\nAltman, our 50-year-old librarian.'
Ross	 (shocked) (To Rachel) How did you know that?!!!!'
Monica	 It\xc2\x92s true?!!'
Ross	 No.'
Rachel	 Yes it is! I saw you guys going at it behind the card catalog!'
Will	 Mrs. Altman? She also made out with Takaka Ci-Kek the night before he went\nback to Thailand.'
Chandler	 I\xc2\x92m sorry. When you were in high school you made out with a\n50-year-old woman?'
Ross	 Hey! She didn\xc2\x92t look 50!'
Chandler	 Did she look 16?'
Rachel	 Ohh, there\xc2\x92s a picture of her in the yearbook actually.'
Phoebe	 Oh! (They all look.) Wow!'
Ross	 She didn\xc2\x92t photograph well!'
Chandler	 Well, she probably wasn\xc2\x92t familiar with the process having spent\nmost of her life sitting for oil paintings!'
Phoebe	 So how did this happen? Did she, did she lure you to an early bird\ndinner?'
Ross	 I was working late in the library one afternoon. It was just the two of\nus. She needed some help with her word jumble. And one thing led to another. If you must\nknow, Anita was very gentle and tender. May she rest in peace\xc2\x85'
Monica	 Didn\xc2\x92t she walk with a cane?'
Ross	 Only when it was damp!! (To Rachel) I can\xc2\x92t believe you-you told\npeople about this?! Everybody knew?! Y\xc2\x92know what? (To Will) I\xc2\x92m back in the\nclub!'
Will	 Yeah! (They high-five.)'
Phoebe	 I wanna join!'
Rachel	 Wh\xc2\x97Phoebe!!'
Phoebe	 I\xc2\x92m sorry. I\xc2\x92m sorry. I never got to be in a club. I-I\ndidn\xc2\x92t go to high school, but three of us would meet behind a dumpster to learn\nFrench. Bonjour.'
Rachel	 All right, y\xc2\x92know\xc2\x97Fine! You guys have your stupid little club,\nbut I would just like to say is what you did to me is way worse than what I did to you!\nYou gave me a tiney-wienie! (Will laughs.)'
Monica	 All right, listen you\xc2\x92re just being silly. Rachel, even with that\nrumor you were one of the most popular girls in school and everyone wanted to be like you.\nOne girl wanted to be like you so much she stuffed her pants with a Tootsie Roll!'
Rachel	 Wow\xc2\x85'
Monica	 And Ross, if it weren\xc2\x92t for Rachel\xc2\x92s rumor I mean no one in\nhigh school would even know who you were. She put you on the map!'
Ross	 As a romancer of the elderly.'
Monica	 Hey! Mrs. Altman was the kind of woman you could tell she used to be\npretty.'
Ross	 The eyes\xc2\x85did still sparkle.'
Monica	 Hey guys this stuff is just so way in the past. You-you\xc2\x92ve been\nthrough so much since then. And right now you\xc2\x92ve got so much more important stuff\ngoing on in your life. Can\xc2\x92t you just let this go?'
Rachel	 She\xc2\x92s right.'
Ross	 Yeah. I mean we are having a baby together.'
Will	 Hold on! You got her pregnant?'
Ross	 Yeah.'
Will	 Are ya getting married?'
Ross	 Nope.'
Will	 So you knocked her up but you\xc2\x92re not gonna marry her. Dude! (Wants\nanother high-five and Ross ignores him.) Anybody?'
Phoebe	 Okay. (Goes over and hugs him.) It\xc2\x92s exactly how I\xc2\x92d imagined\nit would be.'
Joey	 (entering, wearing the maternity pants from earlier) All right\nwhere\xc2\x92s that turkey!'
Phoebe	 Joey! Those are my maternity pants!'
Joey	 Not now! These are my Thanksgiving pants!'

Joey	 Well that\xc2\x92s it. I\xc2\x92m done. Whew! (Wipes his forehead.) There come\nthe meat sweats. (Chandler hands him a towel and he wipes his face.)'
Monica	 Well Joey, we\xc2\x92re all\xc2\x85we\xc2\x92re all very proud of you.'
Chandler	 Yes, I believe we can expect a call from the President any moment now.'
Phoebe	 Is there anything we can do for you?'
Joey	 No just, nobody press on my stomach.'
Rachel	 You can keep those pants by the way.'
Joey	 Whoa\xc2\x97hey\xc2\x97wh-wh-what do you got there? What is that? Pie?'
Monica	 Yeah, you want some?'
Joey	 Ah, just cut me a little sliver. (Monica prepares to cut a little sliver.)\nA little bigger. (Monica prepares to cut a bigger piece.) Little bigger. (Monica moves the\nknife again.) What?! Are you afraid you\xc2\x92re gonna run out?! Cut me a real piece!'
