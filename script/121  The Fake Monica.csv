Joey	 How could someone get a hold of your credit card number?'
Monica	 I have no idea. But look how much they spent!'
Rachel	 Monica, would you calm down? The credit card people said that you only\nhave to pay for the stuff that you bought.'
Monica	 I know. It's just such reckless spending."
Ross	 I think when someone steals your credit card, they've kind of already\nthrown caution to the wind."
Chandler	 Wow, what a geek. They spent $69.95 on a Wonder Mop.'
Monica	 That's me."
Phoebe	 Oh! The yuk! Ross, he's doing it again! (Points to a lamp which is\nshaking behind the sofa)"
Ross	 Marcel, stop humping the lamp! Stop humping! Now Marcel, come back-\n(Marcel runs toward Rachel's room) come here, Marcel-"
Rachel	 Oh no, not in my room! I'll get him."
Monica	 Ross, you've got to do something about the humping."
Ross	 What? It's, it's just a phase."
Chandler	 Well, that's what we said about Joey..."
Ross	 Would you all relax? It's not that big a deal."
Rachel	 (Out of shot) Stop it! Marcel! Bad monkey!'
Ross	 What?'
Rachel	 Let's just say my Curious George doll is no longer curious."

Rachel	 Oh, Monica. You are not still going over that thing.'
Monica	 This woman's living my life."
Rachel	 What?'
Monica	 She's living my life, and she's doing it better than me! Look at this,\nlook. She buys tickets for plays that I wanna see. She, she buys clothes from stores that\nI'm intimidated by the sales people. She spent three hundred dollars on art supplies."
Rachel	 You're not an artist."
Monica	 Yeah, well I might be if I had the supplies! I mean, I could do all this\nstuff. Only I don't."
Rachel	 Oh, Monica, c'mon, you do cool things."
Monica	 Oh really? Okay, let's compare, shall we."
Rachel	 (Yawning) Oh, it's so late for 'Shall we'..."
Monica	 Do I go horseback riding in the park? Do I take classes at the New\nSchool?'
Rachel	 (Yawning) Nooo...'
Monica	 This is so unfair! She's got everything I want, and she doesn't have my\nmother."
Chandler	 How about Joey... Pepponi?'
Joey	 No, still too ethnic. My agent thinks I should have a name that's more\nneutral."
Chandler	 Joey... Switzerland?'
Joey	 Plus, y'know, I think it should be Joe. Y'know, Joey makes me sound like\nI'm, I dunno, this big. (Waitress looks at him funny) Which I'm not."
Chandler	 Joe...Joe...Joe...Stalin?'
Joey	 Stalin...Stalin...do I know that name? It sounds familiar.'
Chandler	 Well, it does not ring a bell with me...'
Joey	 (Writes it down) Joe Stalin. Y'know, that's pretty good."
Chandler	 Might wanna try Joseph.'
Joey	 Joseph Stalin. I think you'd remember that!"
Chandler	 Oh yes! Bye Bye Birdie, starring Joseph Stalin. Joseph Stalin is the\nFiddler on the Roof.'
Rachel	 Hey.'
Phoebe	 Hey.'
Monica	 Hi. (On the phone) Hi, uh, yes, this is Monica Geller. Um, I believe I'm\ntaking some classes with you and I was wondering what they were."
Phoebe	 What are you doing?'
Monica	 (Hushes her) Alright, great. Thanks a lot. (Hangs up) I'm going to tap\nclass."
Rachel	 What, what, so that you can dance with the woman that stole your credit\ncard?'
Monica	 This woman's got my life, I should get to see who she is."
Rachel	 Go to the post office! I'm sure her picture's up! ...Okay, Monica,\ny'know what, honey, you're kinda losing it here! I mean, this is really becoming like a\nweird obsession thing."
Phoebe	 This is madness. It's madness, I tell you, for the love of God,\nMonica, don't do it!! ...Thank you."
Monica	 What d'you think?"
Phoebe	 Lotsa things.'
Rachel	 Which one do you think she is?'
Teacher	 May I help you?'
Monica	 Oh, no thanks, we're just here to observe."
Teacher	 You don't observe a dance class. You dance"
Rachel	 What does she mean?'
Phoebe	 I think she means (Imitates) 'You dance"
Monica	 Okay, d'y'see anybody you think could be me?"
Teacher	 (To the class) People! Last time there were some empty yoghurt\ncontainers lying around after class. Let's not have that happen again!"
Rachel	 She could be you.'
Teacher	 Let's get started. Five, six, a-five six seven eight..."
Monica	 Okay, I'm not getting this!"
Phoebe	 (Dancing in a swirly, Phoebe kind of way) I'm totally getting it!"
Monica	 Did you ever feel like sometimes you are just so unbelievably\nuncoordinated?'
Rachel	 What? You just click when they click.'
Teacher	 Alright people, now everyone grab a partner.'
Phoebe	 Okay. And, my, dead, mother, says, you, are, it. I'm with Rachel."
Monica	 Great. It's gym class all over again."
Phoebe and Rachel	 Aww.'
Teacher	 Well that's all right, you can come up to the front and dance with me."
Monica	 Why don't I just take off my clothes and have a nightmare."
Woman	 It's okay, it's okay, I'm here, I'm here. Sorry I'm late, okay, here I\nam. Who's the new tense girl?"
Teacher	 She's your partner."
Woman	 Hi. I'm Monica."
Monica	 Oh. Monica! ...Hi. I'm Mo- ...nana."
Woman	 (Fake Monica) Monana?'
Monica	 Yeah. It's Dutch."
Fake Monica	 You're kidding! I-I spent three years in Amsterdam. (Asks her\nsomething in Dutch)"
Monica	 Um, Pennsylvania Dutch.'
Teacher	 And we're dancing. A-five, six, seven, eight..."
Ross	 (Mortified) Hi.'
Chandler and Joey	 Hey.'
Joey	 Where've you been?"
Ross	 At the vet.'
Chandler	 She's not gonna make you wear one of those big plastic cones, is she?"
Ross	 She says Marcel's humping thing's not a phase. Apparently he's reached\nsexual maturity."
Joey	 (To Chandler) Hey! He beat ya.'
Ross	 She says as time goes on, he's gonna start getting agressive and violent."
Chandler	 So what does this mean?'
Ross	 I'm gonna have to give him up."

Joey	 I can't believe it, Ross. This sucks!"
Chandler	 I don't get it, I mean, you just got him. How can he be an adult\nalready?"
Ross	 I know. I know. I mean, one day, he's this little thing, and before you\nknow it, he's this little thing I can't get off my leg."
Joey	 Isn't there any way you can keep him?"
Ross	 No, no. The vet says unless he's in a place where he has regular access to\nsome... monkey lovin,' he's just gonna get vicious. I've just gotta get him into a zoo."
Joey	 How do you get a monkey into a zoo?'
Chandler	 I know that one! ...No, that's Popes into a Volkswagen."
Ross	 Well, we're applying to a lot of them. Naturally our first choice would be\none of the bigger state zoos, y'know, like, uh, San Diego... right? But that might just be\na pipe dream, because, y'know, he's out of state. Uh, my vet, uh, knows someone at Miami,\nso that's a possibility."
Chandler	 Yeah, but that's like two blocks away from the beach. I mean, it's a\ntotal party zoo."
Phoebe	 Hey. We found her, we found the girl.'
Chandler	 What?'
Joey	 Did you call the cops?'
Rachel	 Nope. We took her to lunch.'
Chandler	 Ah. Your own brand of vigilante justice.'
Ross	 What?! Are you insane? This woman stole from you. She stole. She's a\nstealer."
Monica	 Y'know what? After you're with this woman for like ten minutes, you\nforget all that. I mean, she is this astounding person, with this, with this amazing\nspirit."
Ross	 Yeah, which she probably stole from some cheerleader.'
Chandler	 ...Take off their hats!'
Phoebe	 Popes in a Volkswagen! ...I love that joke.'
Rachel	 No way. No way did you do this.'
Fake Monica	 Monana was very brave.'
Monica	 It was so wild. We told them we were the Gunnersens in room six fifteen.\nOnly to find out the Boston Celtics had taken over the entire sixth floor!'
Fake Monica	 So once they caught on to the fact that we're, y'know, short and\nhave breasts..."
Monica	 ...They threw us out! I was thrown out of a hotel! Me!'
Rachel	 Go Monana! Well, you ladies are not the only ones living the dream. I\nget to go pour coffee for people I don't know. Don't wait up. (Exits)"
Fake Monica	 Oh, by the way, tomorrow we're auditioning for a Broadway show."
Monica	 'Scuse me?"
Fake Monica	 There's an open call for Cats. I'm thinking we go down there, sing\nMemories and make complete fools of ourselves. Whaddya say?"
Monica	 Nononononono. Think who you're dealing with here. I mean, I'm not like\nyou. I-I can't even stand in front of a tap class."
Fake Monica	 Well, that's just probably 'cause of your Amish background."
Monica	 What?'
Fake Monica	 Well, you're Pennsylvania Dutch, right?"
Monica	 Right. Till I bought a blow dryer, then I was shunned.'
Fake Monica	 I-I used to be just like you. And then one day I saw a movie that\nchanged my life. Did you ever see Dead Poets' Society?"
Monica	 Uh-huh.'
Fake Monica	 I thought that movie was so incredibly... boring.\nI mean, that thing at the end where the kid kills himself because he can't be in the play?\nWhat was that?! It's like, kid, wait a year, leave home, do some community theatre. I\nwalked out of there and I thought, 'Now, that's two hours of my life that I'm never\ngetting back.' And that thought scared me more than all the other crap I was afraid to do."
Monica	 Wow. Then I would definitely not recommend Mrs. Doubtfire.'
Ross	 (Reading letters) Oh God. (To Marcel) We didn't get into Scranton. (To the\nothers) That was like our safety zoo. They take like dogs and cows. See? I don't know who\nthis is harder on, me or him."
Phoebe	 I'd say that chair's taking the brunt."
Ross	 Marcel! Marcel! Marcel, no! Good boy. See, how can nobody want him?'
Rachel	 Oh, somebody will.'
Joey	 (entering) You know there already is a Joseph Stalin?'
Chandler	 You're kidding."
Joey	 Apparently he was this Russian dictator who slaughtered all these people.\nYou'd think you would've known that!"
Chandler	 Y'know, you'd think I would've."
Joey	 Phoebe. Whaddyou think a good stage name for me would be?'
Phoebe	 ...Flame Boy.'
Ross	 Where exactly is your zoo?'
Dr. Baldhara	 Well, it's technically not a zoo per se, it's more of an\ninteractive wildlife experience. Let me ask you some questions about, is it, uh, Marcel?"
Ross	 Yes.'
Dr. Baldhara	 Does he, uh, fight with other animals?'
Ross	 No-no, he's, he's very docile."
Dr. Baldhara	 Even if he were... cornered?'
Ross	 Well I, I don't know. Why?"
Dr. Baldhara	 Uh, how is he at handling small objects?'
Ross	 He can hold a banana, if that's whatcha mean..."
Dr. Baldhara	 How about a hammer, or a small blade?'
Ross	 Why- why- why would he need a blade?'
Dr. Baldhara	 Well, if he's up against a jungle cat or an animal with horns,\nyou've got to give the little guy something. Otherwise it's just cruel."
Chandler and Joey	 He- he- he got in, he- he got in to San\nDiego.'
Joey	 We, we come back from our walk and the- the phone was ringing...'
Chandler	 ...He's in."
Ross	 He's in! Oh, did you hear that, Marcel? San Diego. San Diego!"
Dr. Baldhara	 You're making a big mistake here. I mean, San Diego's all well and\ngood, but if you give him to me, I'll start him off against a blind rabbit and give you\ntwenty percent of the gains."
Monica	 Yo- hooo!'
Rachel	 Where the hell've you been?"
Monica	 Monica and I just crashed an embassy party.'
Rachel	 Are you drunk?!'
Monica	 Noooo! (Comes closer and whispers) I'm lying. I am so drunk."
Rachel	 Oh God, oh. Great, Monica, y'know what, you could've called, I have been\nup here, I've been worried..."
Rachel	 Monica? Monica!'
Monica	 Water rules!'
Rachel	 Yes, yes, it does. Okay, look, the restaurant called, they wanna know if\nyou're gonna be showing up for work?"
Monica	 Nope. Going to the Big Apple Circus today.'
Rachel	 Okay Monica, what are you doing? You're gonna lose your job! This is not\nyou!"
Monica	 No, it is me! Y'know, I'm not just the person who needs to fluff the\npillows and pay the bills as soon as they come in! Y'know, when I'm with her, I am so much\nmore than that. I'm- I'm Monana!"
Rachel	 Hello? Yes, she is, hold on a second, please. Monana, it's for you, the\ncredit card people."
Monica	 Helloooo? Yeah. Oh my God. Thanks.'
Rachel	 What?'
Monica	 They've arrested Monica."
Monica	 Hi.'
Fake Monica	 Hey.'
Monica	 How are you?'
Fake Monica	 I'm not too bad. Fortunately, blue's my colour. How-how did you\nknow I was here?"
Monica	 Because... I'm Monica Geller. It was my credit card you were using."
Fake Monica	 That I was not expecting.'
Monica	 I want you to know, it wasn't me who turned you in."
Fake Monica	 Oh. Thanks.'
Monica	 No, thank you! You have given me so much! I mean, if it wasn't for you,\nI would never have gotten to sing Memories on the stage at the Wintergarden\nTheater!"
Fake Monica	 Well, actually, you only got to sing 'Memo-'."
Monica	 I just can't believe you're in here. I mean, what am I gonna do without\nyou? Who's gonna crash the embassy parties with me? Who's gonna take me to the Big\nApple Circus?"
Fake Monica	 Monica, I started my day by peeing in front of twenty-five other\nwomen, and you're worried about who's gonna take you to the Big Apple Circus?"
Monica	 Well, not... worried, just... wondering.'
Fake Monica	 There's nothing to wonder about, Monica. You're gonna go back to\nbeing exactly who you were, because that's who you are."
Monica	 Not necessarily...'
Fake Monica	 Yes necessarily! I mean, I dunno what it is, maybe it's the Amish\nthing."
Monica	 Um, I'm not actually Amish."
Fake Monica	 Really? Then why are you like that?'
Teacher	 You by the door. In or out?'
Monica	 In. (She joins in the dancing. She still flounders)'
Teacher	 You in the back, you're getting it all wrong!"
Monica	 Yeah, but at least I'm doing it!"
PA	 This is the final boarding call for flight 67 to San Diego,\nboarding at gate 42A.'
Phoebe	 Okay. Good-bye, little monkey guy. Alright, I wrote you this poem. Okay,\nbut don't eat it 'till you get on the plane."
Ross	 Aww. Thank you, Aunt Phoebe.'
Phoebe	 Oh!'
Chandler	 Okay, bye, champ. Now, I know there's gonna be a lot of babes in San\nDiego, but remember, there's also a lot to learn."
Joey	 I dunno what to say, Ross. Uh, it's a monkey."
Ross	 Just, just say what you feel.'
Joey	 Marcel, I'm hungry."
Ross	 That was good.'
Rachel	 (Brings Marcel a teddy bear) Marcel, this is for you. It's, uh, just,\ny'know, something to, um, do on the plane."
Ross	 Uh, if you guys don't mind, I'd like to take a moment, just me and him."
All	 Oh, sure. Sure, absolutely. (They just stand there, then realise\nwhat he means and go to the other end of the room)'
Ross	 Marcel, c'mere, c'mere. (He sits down and Marcel jumps down and sits\nbeside him) Well buddy, this is it. There's just a coupla things I want to say. I'm really\ngonna miss you, and I'm never gonna forget about you. You've been more than just a pet to\nme, you've been more like a be- (Marcel climbs down and starts humping his leg) Okay,\nMarcel, please, could you leave my leg alone? Could you just stop humping me for two\nseconds?! Marcel, would- okay, just take him away. Just take him."

Actor	 (Very melodramatically, and very badly) Oh, that I were a glove\nupon that hand, that I might... touch thy cheek...'
Casting Director No. 1	 That's fine, thank you."
Casting Director No. 2	 Next. (Joey walks onstage)'
Joey	 Hi, uh, I'll be reading for the role of Mercutio."
Casting Director No. 2	 Name?'
Joey	 Holden McGroin.'
