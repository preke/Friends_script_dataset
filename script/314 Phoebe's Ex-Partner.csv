Rachel	 I can get a quick bite to eat, but then I have to come back up here.'
Ross	 Come on sweetie! You\xc2\x92ve had to work late every night for the past two\nweeks, what is it this time?'
Mark	 Actually, it\xc2\x92s kinda my fault. I-I quit today.'

Rachel	 Nooo, he\xc2\x92s leaving for a better job.'
Ross	 Oh well that\xc2\x92s great, so I guess this is ah, this is good bye then.\nHuh? (picks a pad up off Rachel\xc2\x92s desk and tosses it into his box) Good bye.'

Ross	 Okay.'
Rachel	 Well we\xc2\x92re gonna miss you around here.'
Mark	 Yeah, me too.'
Mark	 So, see ya on Saturday.'
Rachel	 Yeah, you bet.'
Phoebe	 Oh. (takes her beeper puts in a pot, covers it, and puts the pot in the\noven)'
Monica	 Y'know those are a delicacy in India."
Phoebe	 Yeah, that was Leslie calling again to see if we can get back together.\nThat\xc2\x92s the twentieth time today! And good luck Leslie!'
Monica	 Wow, she must have hurt you pretty bad, huh?'
Phoebe	 Well, yeah. Y'know, we were best friends, ever since we were little, our\nMoms worked on the barge together."
Monica	 Oh, you two must have been so cute running around on a barge.'
Phoebe	 You never run on a barge!'
Joey	 (entering) Hey.'
Phoebe and Monica	 Hey.'
Joey	 Is ah, is Chandler around?'
Monica	 No, umm, he met some girl at the coffee house.'
Joey	 Oooh.'
Monica	 Yeah, Ginger something.'
Joey	 Nooo. No, no, ah, are you sure it wasn\xc2\x92t something that sounded like\nGinger, like ah, Gingeer?'
Monica	 No, it was Ginger. I remember, because when he told me, I said,\n(singing) \xc2\x91the movie star.\xc2\x92'
Joey	 Aww, man. That\xc2\x92s the girl I was hiding from. When she finds out\nhe\xc2\x92s my roommate, she\xc2\x92s gonna tell him what I did.'
Monica	 Well, what did you do?'
Joey	 What, oh, oh, oh, no, no, I can\xc2\x92t, I can\xc2\x92t tell you that,\nit\xc2\x92s like the most awful, horrible thing I\xc2\x92ve ever done my whole life.'
Monica	 Y'know what, don\xc2\x92t tell us. We\xc2\x92ll just wait until Chandler\ngets home, (to Phoebe) because it\xc2\x92ll be more fun that way."
Joey	 All right!! Okay, it was like four years ago. Okay, Ginger and I had gone\nout a few times, and then this one weekend, we went up to her Dad\xc2\x92s cabin. Just me,\nher, and her annoying little dog Pepper. Well that night, I cooked this really romantic\ndinner....'
Monica	 You gave her food poisoning!?'
Joey	 I wish. No. After dinner, me, her, and Pepper all fell asleep in front of\nthe fire. Well I woke up in the middle of the night and I saw that the fire was dying out.\nSo, I picked up a log and threw it on. Or, at least what I thought was a log.'
Phoebe	 Oh my God!! You threw Pepper on the fire!'
Joey	 I wish. See, I guess another thing I probably should\xc2\x92ve told you\nabout Ginger is that she kinda has a ah, artificial leg.'
Monica	 Oh my God! Joey, what did you do after you threw her leg on the fire?'
Joey	 I ran!!'
Chandler	 Well, that\xc2\x92s the best kiss I\xc2\x92ve had with anyone I\xc2\x92ve\never met in a men\xc2\x92s room.'
Ginger	 Actually, me too.'
Chandler	 (sees her foot is in a slush puddle) Op, foot in a puddle, foot all in\na puddle.'
Ginger	 Oh damn, I hate that.'
Chandler	 Yeah, we\xc2\x92re gonna have to get you out of those shoes.'
Ginger	 Oh, don\xc2\x92t worry about it.'
Chandler	 No, really you\xc2\x92re gonna freeze.'
Ginger	 No, I\xc2\x92m not.'
Chandler	 You\xc2\x92re not, what do you, what do you got a bionic foot?'
Ginger	 Some day, maybe.'
Rachel	 Funny book?'
Ross	 Hmmm. Oh, no, no, I just thinking about something funny I heard today.\nUmm, Mark, Mark saying \xc2\x91I\xc2\x92ll see you Saturday.\xc2\x92'
Rachel	 Yeah, at the lecture, I told you that last week, you said you\ndidn\xc2\x92t mind.'
Ross	 Oh, no, no, no, it\xc2\x92s-it\xc2\x92s not the lecture ah, I mind, umm....'
Rachel	 Oh, please tell me it\xc2\x92s not because I\xc2\x92m going with Mark.'
Ross	 Oh, well...'
Rachel	 Oh my God!!! Ross!!'
Ross	 Well, I\xc2\x92m sorry, but ah, look if you\xc2\x92re not working with him\nanymore, why do you have to still do stuff with him?'
Rachel	 Because, he\xc2\x92s my friend.'
Ross	 Okay, but do you really need another friend? I mean...'
Rachel	 Okay, well if I stop playing with Joey and Chandler, can I play with\nMark?'
Ross	 Is that funny? Am I supposed to be laughing?'
Rachel	 I don\xc2\x92t know, you thought \xc2\x91See you Saturday\xc2\x92 was funny.\nLook honey, Mark is in fashion okay, I like having a friend that I can share this stuff\nwith. You guys would never want to go to a lecture with me.'
Ross	 Pa-haa!! I would love to go with you.'
Rachel	 Really!?'
Ross	 Yeah, hey I-I have clothes, I even pick them out. I mean for, for all you\nknow I could be a fashion..... monger.'
Rachel	 Okay. Honey, I would love for you to go with me. (Ross has a worried\nlook on his face) What?'
Ross	 What should I wear, now I\xc2\x92m all nervous.'
Monica	 Y'know they say a watched pot never beeps."
Phoebe	 It\xc2\x92s just y'know, been a couple of hours, and she hasn\xc2\x92t\ncalled. Not that I even care, y'know."
Monica	 Phoebe why don\xc2\x92t you just call her? You obviously want to.'
Phoebe	 You think you know me so well.'
Monica	 Well, don\xc2\x92t \xc2\x91cha wanna?'
Phoebe	 Yeah.'
Monica	 Okay, well I do know you.'
Phoebe	 That\xc2\x92s what I said.'
Monica	 Well so?'
Phoebe	 I can\xc2\x92t. I can\xc2\x92t. She dumped me, I mean I totally trusted her\nand then one day it was \xc2\x91Okay, bye Pheebs\xc2\x92 gone. Y'know what the saddest part\nis, when we were playing together, that was like the most fun I\xc2\x92ve ever had in like\nall my lives."
Leslie	 (singing) My best shoes, so good to me. I wear them everyday. Down at\nthe heel, holes in the toes. Don\xc2\x92t care what people say. My feet\xc2\x92s best friends,\npals to the end. With them I\xc2\x92m one hot chicky. Though late one night, not much light,\nI....'
Phoebe	 (singing) I stepped in something icky.'
Phoebe and Leslie	 (singing) Sticky shoes, sticky shoes, always make me smile.\nSticky shoes, sticky shoes, next time I\xc2\x92ll.... avoid the..... pillleeeee.'

Lecturer	 We\xc2\x92re beginning to see a lot of layering of sheer fabrics and\ncolours. For instance a sheer navy blouse over a pink....'
Ross	 (to Rachel) I\xc2\x92m really glad we came. (Rachel smiles and rubs his arm)\nYou\xc2\x92re so pretty. I love you.'
Rachel	 Oh. (puts her hand over his mouth)'
Phoebe	 (singing) Smelly cat, smelly cat, what are they feeding you? Smelly cat,\nsmelly cat, it\xc2\x92s not your fault.'
Leslie	 Wow, that\xc2\x92s great.'
Phoebe	 Oh, yeah!'
Leslie	 Y'know you could totally sell this. It\xc2\x92d be perfect for like umm, a\nkitty litter campaign."
Phoebe	 I..., a jingle? No, no-no-no, no.'
Leslie	 What? Why not? You could make a ton of money.'
Phoebe	 Okay, well if I was in this for the money, I\xc2\x92d be a millionaire by\nnow, y'know. You just got to get out of that jingle head sweetie."
Leslie	 Aw, you\xc2\x92re right, you\xc2\x92re right. I\xc2\x92m sorry.'
Phoebe	 That\xc2\x92s okay. All right, I\xc2\x92m gonna play song that\xc2\x92s\nreally, really sad. It\xc2\x92s called Magician Box Mix Up. (she turns her guitar upside\ndown to play it.)'
Lecturer	 ....oversized bracelets, oversized earrings, oversizing of accessories\nin general are very popular now.'
Monica	 (entering) Hi!'
Chandler	 Hey.'
Monica	 Oh, can I borrow this? (points to his milk) My milk\xc2\x92s gone bad.'
Chandler	 Oh, I hate that. I once had a thing of half and half, stole my car.'
Monica	 So umm, how was your date with Ginger?'
Chandler	 Great. It was great. She\xc2\x92s ah, she\xc2\x92s great, great looking,\ngreat personality, she\xc2\x92s greatness.'
Monica	 Sounds like she\xc2\x92s got the ah, whole package.'
Chandler	 Joey told you about the leg, huh?'
Monica	 Uh-huh.'
Chandler	 Oh God, it freaked me out. Okay, I know it shouldn\xc2\x92t have, but it\ndid. I mean I like her, I don\xc2\x92t want to stop seeing her, but every so often it\xc2\x92s\nlike \xc2\x91Hey, y'know what, where\xc2\x92s your leg?\xc2\x92 I mean I\xc2\x92m the smallest\nperson in the world aren\xc2\x92t I? I\xc2\x92m the smallest person in the world."
Joey	 (entering from his bedroom) Morning.'
Chandler	 (to Monica) Actually he\xc2\x92s the smallest person in the world.'
Joey	 (to Chandler) Heard about the leg burnin\xc2\x92 huh?'
Chandler	 It came up.'
Joey	 Listen, I ah, I know it\xc2\x92s a longshot. But, by any chance did she find\nthat funny?'
Ross	 (entering) So I nodded off a little.'
Rachel	 Nodded off!! Ross you were snoring. My father\xc2\x92s boat didn\xc2\x92t\nmake that much noise when it hit rocks!'
Ross	 Come on! Forty-five minutes! Forty-five minutes the man talked about\nstrappy backed dresses.'
Rachel	 Well okay, how about four hours in a freezing museum auditorium\nlistening to Professor Pitstains and he\xc2\x92s \xc2\x91Hey everybody! Remember that thing\nthat\xc2\x92s been dead for a gazillion years. Well there\xc2\x92s this little bone we\ndidn\xc2\x92t know it had!\xc2\x92'
Ross	 First of all it\xc2\x92s Professor Pittain! And second of all, that little\nbone, proved that, that particular dinosaur had wings, but didn\xc2\x92t fly.'
Rachel	 Okay, see now, what I just heard
Ross	 Y'know what, 100 million people went to see a movie about what I do, I\nwonder how many people would go see a movie called, Jurassic Parka."
Rachel	 Oh, that is so...'
Ross	 No-no-no, a bunch of out of control jackets take over an island. (Makes an\nunusual sound, then he realises that he still has his jacket on and quickly tries to shake\nit off, thinking it\xc2\x92s alive and attacking him.)'
Rachel	 Y'know if what I do is so lame, then why did you insist on coming with\nme this morning? Huh? Was it so I just wouldn\xc2\x92t go with Mark?"
Ross	 No. I... I wanted to be with you. I don\xc2\x92t know, I feel like lately, I\nfeel like you\xc2\x92re slipping away from me, y'know. With this new job, and all these new\npeople, and you\xc2\x92ve got this whole other life going on. I-I-I know it\xc2\x92s dumb, but\nI hate that I\xc2\x92m not a part of it."
Rachel	 It\xc2\x92s not dumb. But, maybe it\xc2\x92s okay that you\xc2\x92re not a\npart of it. Y'know what I mean? (Ross looks confused) I mean it\xc2\x92s like, I-I-I like\nthat you\xc2\x92re not involved in that part of my life."
Ross	 That\xc2\x92s a little clearer.'
Rachel	 Honey see, it doesn\xc2\x92t mean that I don\xc2\x92t love you. Because I\ndo. I love you, I love you so much. But my work it\xc2\x92s-it\xc2\x92s for me y'know,\nI\xc2\x92m out there, on my own, and I\xc2\x92m doing it and it\xc2\x92s scary but I love it,\nbecause it\xc2\x92s mine. I, but, I mean is that okay?"
Ross	 Sure, I-I-I... (hugs her and mouths No!!)'
Ginger	 Your thinking about my leg aren\xc2\x92t you?'
Chandler	 No. No. Actually I forgot, what is the deal with that again?'
Ginger	 It\xc2\x92s okay if it bothers you. Really. I mean the only thing I need\nto know is
Chandler	 No. No. I don\xc2\x92t think so.'
Ginger	 Okay. It\xc2\x92s just like anything else, you just have to get used to\nit.'
Ginger	 What\xc2\x92s that?'
Chandler	 That\xc2\x92s-that\xc2\x92s my nubbin.'
Ginger	 What\xc2\x92s a nubbin?'
Chandler	 It\xc2\x92s kinda a ah, a third nipple kinda thing.'
Ginger	 You have three nipples?'
Chandler	 Well, y'know two regulars. And ah one that barely qualifies as...\n(starts to kiss her again, but she gets up.) Ahh, what?"
Ginger	 Nothing. I, I just remembered I have to leave.'
Chandler	 You ah, you have, you have to leave, now? How come?'
Ginger	 Ah well, it\xc2\x92s nubbin. Nothing! Umm. Y'know what, I\xc2\x92ll see you\nlater. Okay. (She leaves and in the hall we see her shake her shoulders like when someone\nruns their fingernails across a blackboard.)"
Phoebe	 (to Leslie) Oh, I thought you weren\xc2\x92t coming. What? Where were you?'
Leslie	 Come here, come here. (they go to the side of the stage) Okay,\ndon\xc2\x92t get mad, okay.'
Phoebe	 Okay, don\xc2\x92t give me a reason to get mad, okay'
Leslie	 I played Smelly Cat for the people at my old ad agency, they went nuts.'
Phoebe	 No, look, I told you that I didn\xc2\x92t want you to try and sell it, and\nyou just, you big fat did it anyway. God, y'know what, I think five years ago I probably\nwould\xc2\x92ve done anything to play with you but, I can do it by myself. And if I\ncan\xc2\x92t trust you then just forget it. "
Leslie	 No, no, I don\xc2\x92t want to forget it.'
Phoebe	 Okay y'know what you have to choose. All right, if-if the most important\nthing on the planet to you is this cat poopy thing then, okay you can have Smelly Cat, but\nwe won\xc2\x92t be partners. So what\xc2\x92s it gonna be?"
Commercial	 (in the background their singing Smelly Cat) Problem odour in the\nlitter box? Don\xc2\x92t change your kitty, change your kitty litter.'
Monica	 Sorry, Pheebs.'
Joey	 Yeah. You okay?'
Phoebe	 Yeah. I actually am, yeah. Y'know life-life\xc2\x92s gonna had you all\nkinds of stuff, y'know you learn your little lessons and hopefully you grow. Wanna hear a\nnew song?"
Joey	 Yeah.'
Monica	 We\xc2\x92d love too.'
Phoebe	 Okay. (singing) \xc2\x91Jingle bitch screwed me over! Go to hell jingle\nwhore! Go to hell Go to hell. Go to hell-hell-hell.\xc2\x92 That\xc2\x92s all I have so far.'

Chandler	 (entering, happily) Well hello!'
Joey	 Where have you been?'
Chandler	 The doctor.'
Ross	 Is everything okay?'
Chandler	 Oh yes! Just had me a little nubbin-ectomy. Yep! Two nipples, no\nwaiting.'
Monica	 Wow! It\xc2\x92s like Rachel in High School.'
Rachel	 What?!!'
Monica	 Come on! Come on, I was kidding! It was such an obvious joke!'
Chandler	 That was an obvious joke, and I didn\xc2\x92t think of it.\nWhy didn\xc2\x92t I think of it? The source of all my powers. Oh dear God, what have I done!'
