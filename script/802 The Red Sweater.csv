Chandler	 (to the front desk clerk) Hi! We\xc2\x92re checking out of the bridal\nsuite.'
Monica	 (depressed) That\xc2\x92s right. I\xc2\x92m no longer a bride. I\xc2\x92ll\nnever be a bride again. Now, I\xc2\x92m just someone\xc2\x92s wife!'

Chandler	 I\xc2\x92ll tell you what, I will go get them developed and you can go\nhome.'
Monica	 Okay.'
Chandler	 What? What did you take a picture of?'
Joey	 Nothing! It was something.'
Chandler	 Okay Ross has the cameras, has he checked out yet?'
Rachel	 Are you joking? Check out is not \xc2\x91til noon and he has a good\n(checks her watch) eleven minutes left.'
Chandler	 Oh.'
Monica	 Ross has never checked out of a room a minute before he had to.'
Rachel	 Yeah, one time, when we were dating, uh we got a late checkout, he got\nso excited it was the best sex we ever had. Until y\xc2\x92know, he screamed out Radisson\nat the end.'
Chandler	 Okay, well I\xc2\x92m gonna get Ross, get the cameras, and get them\ndeveloped. (Joey laughs again.) 32 Joe. You\xc2\x92re 32! (Exits)'

Joey	 Yeah, that\xc2\x92s sad. Mashuga nut?'

Ross	 Hi.'
Chandler	 Hey. (He sees that Ross is packing all of the hotel toiletries) Soaps?\nShampoos? Are you really taking all this stuff?'
Ross	 Why not? It\xc2\x92s built into the price of the room.'
Chandler	 Yeah but you don\xc2\x92t need\xc2\x97(Picks up something)\xc2\x97What is\nthis?'
Ross	 Thread!'
Chandler	 Score! Where are the disposable cameras?'
Ross	 What disposable cameras?'
Chandler	 The cameras? Remember last night I told you to take them?'
Ross	 No you didn\xc2\x92t.'
Chandler	 Yes! Remember? Right before we cut the cake, I went up to you and I\nsaid\xc2\x85'
Ross	 Oh-oh yeah, you-you came up to me and asked if I could do you a favor, and\nmy Uncle Murray came up to you and handed you a check. And then you said, "Why do\nthey call it a check? Why not a Yugoslavian?" (Chandler laughs.) Yeah, then you did\nthat.'
Chandler	 So you don\xc2\x92t have the cameras?!'
Ross	 No. Sorry man.'
Chandler	 So? What? What? They\xc2\x92re gone! Monica\xc2\x92s gonna freak!'
Ross	 Well, I\xc2\x92m sure they\xc2\x92re still somewhere here in the hotel.\nI\xc2\x92ll-I\xc2\x92ll help you look for them.'
Chandler	 Great.'
Ross	 In-in three minutes.'
Phoebe	 Hey!'
Monica	 Hey!'
Phoebe	 Are you gonna open the presents without Chandler?'
Monica	 No! (Pause) But, they\xc2\x92re callin\xc2\x92 out to me! I mean this little\nguy (Holds up a small one) even crawled up into my lap. Oh come on, Chandler wouldn\xc2\x92t\nmind if I opened just one present! What do you think it is?'

Monica	 A tiny salt shaker!!!'
Phoebe	 Ohhh! My God! For tiny salt!'
Monica	 Oh wow! Okay. Well that was fun.'
Phoebe	 Oh yeah.'
Monica	 Good. Okay, I\xc2\x92m just gonna wait for Chandler to open the rest of\nthem.'
Phoebe	 Okay.'
Monica	 Whew. Although y\xc2\x92know, this is part of a salt and pepper set. I\nmean\xc2\x85 I guess y\xc2\x92know it may just count as a half a present. What do you think?'
Phoebe	 Well I guess it\xc2\x92s okay to open one more if it\xc2\x92s part of a set.\nY\xc2\x92know, it\xc2\x92s probably this one. (Grabs another small one.)'
Monica	 Or this one! (She grabs and starts to open the biggest present.)'
Rachel	 (entering) Hi.'
Monica	 Hey, how are you feelin\xc2\x92? Any morning sickness?'
Rachel	 Shh-shh-shh! The guys don\xc2\x92t know yet do they?'
Monica	 No! Joey and Ross don\xc2\x92t know anything and Chandler still thinks\nthat Phoebe\xc2\x92s pregnant.'
Phoebe	 Yeah that\xc2\x92s right Chandler does still think I\xc2\x92m pregnant. He\nhasn\xc2\x92t asked me how I\xc2\x92m feeling or offered to carry my bags. Boy, I feel bad for\nthe woman who ends up with him. (Monica looks at her.) After you of course.'
Rachel	 Don\xc2\x92t worry I promise that you will only have to be pregnant for a\nfew more hours, \xc2\x91cause I\xc2\x92m going to tell the father today.'
Phoebe	 Ooh, is it someone in this building? Is it that tall guy from the first\nfloor?'
Rachel	 Ew! No!'
Phoebe	 What?! I think he\xc2\x92s cute.'
Rachel	 Well then you have his baby.'
Phoebe	 Believe me I\xc2\x92m trying.'
Monica	 Wow. Y\xc2\x92know it is so weird. I mean, you\xc2\x92re gonna tell this guy\ntoday and he has no idea what\xc2\x92s gonna happen.'
Phoebe	 Yeah. You\xc2\x92re just gonna knock on his door and change his life\nforever. You\xc2\x92re like Ed McMahon except without the big check, or the raw sexual\nmagnetism.'
Rachel	 Yeah. Uh-huh, I guess it is pretty big news.'
Phoebe	 Pretty big? It\xc2\x92s huge! God, this guy doesn\xc2\x92t have a clue!\nHe\xc2\x92s just walking down the street thinking, \xc2\x91I had sex with Rachel Green. I\nrock!\xc2\x92 then bam! He\xc2\x92s a father and everything\xc2\x92s different.'
Rachel	 Well it\xc2\x92s only different if he wants it to be. I mean, I\xc2\x92m not\ngonna ask him for anything.'
Phoebe	 Okay. Then he still has this huge decision to make. Now he\xc2\x92s\nwalking around thinking, \xc2\x91Do I want to be a dad?\xc2\x92 and then bam!'
Monica	 What was that bam?'
Phoebe	 I don\xc2\x92t. He got\xc2\x85he-he-he-he\xc2\x92s hit by a bus.'

Rachel	 Hey Joey, what would you do if someone that you slept with told you that\nshe was pregnant?'
Joey	 (warily) Who called here? Did she sound blond? Huh? Did-did-did she have\nan accent? I gotta make a call! (Starts to leave) I shoulda never walked into that\nSunglass Hut!'
Rachel	 Oh Joey! Joey! No, it\xc2\x92s not you! You didn\xc2\x92t get anybody\npregnant!'
Joey	 Oh. Why would you scare me like that? What the hell is going on? (Pause.)\nIs somebody pregnant?'

Joey	 Whoa, wait a minute. Who\xc2\x92s the father?'
Phoebe	 You don\xc2\x92t know him. It\xc2\x92s not important. He wants nothing to do\nwith me or the baby. (She sits down like she\xc2\x92s pregnant.)'
Joey	 Well who is this guy?! Huh? Who is he? \xc2\x91Cause I will track him down\nand kick his ass!'
Phoebe	 David Lynn.'
Joey	 David Lynn! David Lynn! David Lynn!! (Exits)'

Ross	 Well I checked in the uh, lost and found, I talked to the manager,\nno-one\xc2\x92s turned them.'
Chandler	 Well this is great. Y\xc2\x92know, those cameras were the only thing\nthat was gonna cheer Monica up today, she\xc2\x92s really depressed.'
Ross	 Now you guys just got married, why is she so depressed?'
Chandler	 All my energy is going into not asking that question. I can\xc2\x92t\nbelieve I screwed this up!'
Ross	 I\xc2\x92m sorry man. (Formally dressed people start to enter.) Here\xc2\x92s\na thought. This is the same ballroom. There\xc2\x92s a band. There\xc2\x92s gonna be plenty of\ndressed up people.'
Chandler	 Are you suggesting we dance our troubles away?'
Ross	 No-no-no, I\xc2\x92m saying we-we buy more of this (disposable cameras) at\nthe gift shop, throw our tuxes back on, and take a few pictures. All we have to do is make\nsure not to get anybody else\xc2\x92s faces.'
Chandler	 Are you serious?'
Ross	 I\xc2\x92m just thinking about your new bride at home. Okay? Do-do you\nreally want to start your life together by letting her down?'
Chandler	 Marriage advice? Really?!'
Ross	 I\xc2\x92m telling you, this looks exactly like your wedding! Aren\xc2\x92t\nthese the same flowers?'
Chandler	 I don\xc2\x92t know, Monica picked out the flowers.'
Ross	 What about the chairs?'
Chandler	 She picked those out too.'

Rachel	 I don\xc2\x92t know, let me think. I was walking down the street thinking,\n\xc2\x91I\xc2\x92m gonna tell the father today\xc2\x92 and then bam!'
Phoebe	 Bus?'
Rachel	 No, you! Phoebe you freaked me out. You kept saying how huge this all\nis!'
Phoebe	 Well-well but it is huge.'
Rachel	 I know, but I was just thinking about how huge this is for me. I\ndidn\xc2\x92t even go to how huge this was going to be for the father.'
Phoebe	 You\xc2\x92re thinking about this way too much. Just tell him and get it\nover with. It\xc2\x92s like, it\xc2\x92s like ripping off this Band-Aid. (On her arm) Quick\nand painless, watch. (Rips it off.) Oh mother of\xc2\x85See?'

Monica	 Oh my God! Joey!'
Phoebe	 Hell yeah! I\xc2\x92ll marry you! (She grabs the ring and puts it on.)'
Monica	 You can\xc2\x92t marry him!'
Phoebe	 Hey lady, your day\xc2\x92s over! It\xc2\x92s my turn!'
Monica	 Phoebe!'
Joey	 Why?! Why can\xc2\x92t she marry me?!'
Phoebe	 I can and I will! (Kisses him.)'

Joey	 Oh my God.'
Phoebe	 Hey!'
Monica	 Phoebe I think he would notice if you didn\xc2\x92t have a baby in nine\nmonths!'
Phoebe	 It\xc2\x92s Joey! (Joey turns and looks at her and she mouths \xc2\x91I love\nyou\xc2\x92 to him.)'
Joey	 (smiles then stops) Now I can\xc2\x92t believe it! What? Rachel\xc2\x92s\npregnant? (The girls nod yes.) Who\xc2\x92s the father?'

Joey	 Ohh\xc2\x85 I wonder if that dude.'
Monica	 There\xc2\x92s a dude?'
Joey	 Yeah.'
Phoebe	 Who? Who is it?'
Joey	 About a month ago this guy spent the night with Rachel, I didn\xc2\x92t see\nwho it was but\xc2\x85 (He walks out and closes the door.)'
Phoebe	 Was that story over? '
Joey	 The guy left this.'
Phoebe	 (gasps) Oh my God! I know who the father is\xc2\x85 (She walks into Monica\nand Chandler\xc2\x92s.)'
Monica	 People have got to finish their stories!'

Chandler	 (to another couple) Uh, excuse me? Could you take a picture of us?'
Woman At The Wedding	 Oh! Of course. (Ross and Chandler pose and she takes the\npicture.)'
Man At The Wedding	 Uh, would you take one of us?'
Chandler	 Uhh\xc2\x85 Yeah sure. (Holds the camera up to his face.) Click!'
Woman At The Wedding	 It didn\xc2\x92t click.'
Ross	 I heard it. I heard it.'
Man At The Wedding	 But there was no flash.'
Woman At The Wedding	 Why won\xc2\x92t you take our picture?'
Chandler	 Oh yeah. I\xc2\x92ll take, I\xc2\x92ll take your picture. (He takes the\npicture with his finger over the lens.)'
Man At The Wedding	 Uh, your finger was covering the lens.'
Chandler	 Who are you? Ansel Adams?! Get outta here!'
Phoebe	 Look, I feel really bad about how I freaked you out before, so I called\nthe father and asked him to meet you here so you can tell him. Go!'
Rachel	 What? Hey wait a minute! Phoebe, how do you even know who the father is?'
Phoebe	 I may play the fool at times, but I\xc2\x92m a little more than a pretty\nblond girl with an ass that won\xc2\x92t quit. (She takes the sweater out of her purse.) I\nbelieve this belongs to the father of your baby.'
Rachel	 Oh God\xc2\x85 Oh, he\xc2\x92s in there right now?'
Phoebe	 Uh-huh. Now you can turn around or you can go in there and rip the\nBand-Aid off. What to you want to do?'

Phoebe	 Oh no. Could I get anyone a coffee or\xc2\x85poison? No? Just for me?\nOkay. (Walks away.)'
Tag	 What\xc2\x92s going on Rach?'
Rachel	 Nothing! Phoebe kinda made a mistake. But y\xc2\x92know you do wear that\nsweater a lot, are you involved in some kind of dare?'
Tag	 Y\xc2\x92know, I\xc2\x92m actually glad Phoebe called. (He pulls out a stool\nand Rachel sits down.) I know we broke up because you thought I wasn\xc2\x92t mature enough,\nbut I\xc2\x92ve really grown up and think we should get back together.'

Joey	 Oh hey! You got my parent\xc2\x92s gift! (Holds it up.)'
Monica	 Yeah. What is that?'
Joey	 Well, I don\xc2\x92t know. I think it does something to salami.'

So we don\xc2\x92t need\xc2\x97(Rips the picture)\xc2\x97There\xc2\x92s no\nneed to have this picture. How about I take the real pictures and get them developed right\nnow.'
